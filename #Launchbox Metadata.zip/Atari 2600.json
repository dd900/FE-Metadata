These carts were individually numbered and there were only two ways of getting one: By placing an order of $50 or more in the AtariAge Store, or by participating in the 2003 AtariAge Holiday GreetingCart Contest and winning one for free!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Andrew Davie","Publisher":"Atari Age","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":153632,"FileName":"fb608cb5-c14a-4c5c-8344-d0e0713050c0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":153632,"FileName":"ee96bb0a-95b1-48d4-8c30-7bfb92b0d82f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":153632,"FileName":"40098f8d-632e-44b4-825b-aafb0c3b606a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153632,"FileName":"59dc2d63-4657-49be-ac59-31b320166133.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":153632,"FileName":"612a6754-4217-42dd-95a2-1421df2091c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":157130,"Name":"2005 MiniGame MultiCart","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"This cartridge contains seven entries from the 2005 Minigame Competition with an onscreen menu for selecting the games.

To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3×3 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dfWCkyf70Y","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1980-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"78d785e2-17dc-4355-a535-5f6cfe6659f7.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"3a6f601a-e541-4f20-b92c-67cce48cc697.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"0c7ba259-9a1f-4372-a636-250d51fe248a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"09a6109e-d94d-4c63-be1d-38bfaecd7762.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"2d92d082-928a-4487-b3ae-2ba1afb142f5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"05c375d6-291f-448e-91b8-64254b2d71ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"be14d588-e375-4c86-9f05-db30b0dd92df.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"2af1c9c8-f452-42f0-a19d-64231c983531.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"a885eb1c-80db-4562-97e1-399afd0f53ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"723a1d8c-a401-41db-966a-0598e00c881b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"34d0e101-b58c-4903-8c92-fab058992b90.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"f8cd9f51-5175-4245-a404-16320b3b0202.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"fcb1b98e-4e9e-4efa-8306-63a47b690f34.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"e5e96a05-227c-435f-833e-7e543c91b603.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"a89f36f6-1b11-406d-a44b-64690d324e2f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"858e43a5-fb1d-477c-a12a-9e5f737a1765.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"42f9dfdb-543f-4b77-8230-be92a31a25ef.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"bac5e111-8314-4581-8a91-922ad270ae0f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"bab78a6b-983e-4693-8f22-cb159e6e46dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"7228cd1f-cd0f-428a-94f1-a5a7a81ee0e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"50a188a2-8809-4c4a-b6f7-f2136ae83932.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"11ab077d-8bd1-44fb-b31c-18801bf35cd7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"9d301b92-66cb-469e-a2f3-13a5bf75234a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"bbc3bf46-5e7b-42f6-8a4a-189e010851ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":14683,"FileName":"f3907eb2-ca7e-4525-842c-7c568a062989.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":14683,"AlternateName":"Tic Tac Toe","Region":"South America"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"AlternateName":"Jogo da Velha 3D","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":14683,"AlternateName":"3D Tic Tac Toe","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":158074,"Name":"3-D Zapper","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Unreleased game programmed by Todd Marshall.

The object of the game is to rescue the Enchanted Chalice and place it inside the Golden Castle where it belongs. \n\nThis is no easy task, as the Evil Magician has created three Dragons to hinder you in your quest for the Golden Chalice. There is Yorgle, the Yellow Dragon, who is just plain mean; there is Grundle, the Green Dragon, who is mean and ferocious; and there is Rhindle, the Red Dragon, who is the most ferocious of all. Rhindle is also the fastest Dragon and is the most difficult to outmaneuver.\n\nThere are three castles in the Kingdom; the White Castle, the Black Castle, and the Golden Castle. Each castle has a Gate over the entrance. The Gate can be opened with the corresponding colored Key. Inside each Castle are rooms(or dungeons, depending at which Skill Level you are playing).\n\nThe Castles are separated by rooms, pathways, and labyrinths. Common to all the Skill Levels is the Blue Labyrinth through which you must find your way to the Black Castle. Skill Levels 2 and 3 have a more complicated Kingdom\n\nAdventure was the first action-adventure game on a video console, the first to contain a widely-known Easter egg, and the first to allow a player to have a stash of items, which required the player to select which one to use at any given moment, usually through keyboard or joystick input. Adventure allowed the player to drop one item and pick up another without having to type in any commands. The graphics, on the other hand, were not that great, and Adventure creator Warren Robinett even described the dragons as looking like ducks.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6-zN_eaRd8","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Warren Robinett","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1980-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"65565aab-8b4d-470b-b10b-4c702f1a71e8.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"0fde6a29-76ff-4f3a-bb57-776ea7ef8bd4.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"1e796d1f-6d7d-4ba1-9a82-7b8b8a951dcc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"910aede1-d305-46ba-b8e6-395570f6a466.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"2b976ff5-efb0-4ba0-ac50-6fc9b960a941.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"845be896-aa3d-4ff2-b042-6069263d33ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"946b07b6-2bd5-4bd5-93be-d8246c65e264.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"9f375fa2-408b-4dc2-be2e-3677420925f7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"ba1a385f-6277-407a-8ea2-dddd4f240f54.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"ba434122-0252-4860-a7f2-55c7ebe2d365.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"8aa3424e-75eb-4217-8ec6-b016f48762d6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"0f349d21-aaa9-4adf-ac09-b9fd25a10d12.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"e4e6a03f-e3c2-4fef-92b5-e329fe31c414.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"cf3be028-af6a-4395-8962-3ccb7dc0bd9a.JPG","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"21297ce9-f1d5-4412-b42a-54539799f79e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"4c7e102d-a989-4c1d-a20b-644f34ffe4b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"04dcb13f-1d04-40a7-a411-de0a3878c46a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"0a5c027d-adfd-451d-bdda-76a6004b2ca1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"113898bd-ffe9-47b3-88f6-440cd89f6c77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2570,"FileName":"bb9e8c9c-406e-43cc-b8b7-832fe2f053e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":2570,"AlternateName":"Adventuri","Region":"Brazil"},{"DatabaseID":2570,"AlternateName":"Aventura","Region":"Brazil"}]},{"DatabaseID":109513,"Name":"Adventure II","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"Adventure II is a action-adventure game developed by Curt Vendel and published by Atari on the Atari Flashback 2 in 2005.

On most settings, you are positioned at the bottom of the screen and you shoot at targets at the top of the screen. The various settings provide different targets and weapons with different characteristics.\n\nIn games 1-6, you are an anti-aircraft gun and you shoot, unsurprisingly, at aircraft. You are stationary. Your control is limited to selecting the time of firing, the angle at which your shot is fired and, on some settings, exertion of minor control over the direction of your missile.\n\nIn games 7-12, you are a submarine and you shoot torpedoes at the ships above. On these settings you are able to move your submarine back and forth across the bottom of the screen. Your torpedoes, however, can only be fired directly above. Some settings allow minor control over the direction of your torpedo once fired. In games 13-15, you are apparently the anti-aircraft gun again. This time, however, you are shooting at shooting gallery targets (clown faces, ducks, rabbits). The controls are as in games 1-6.\n\nIn games 16-18, you are a ship and you fire polaris missiles at jets flying above. Your ship constantly moves on its own, you control only the speed. When you fire, the angle of the missile and its speed are based on the speed your ship was traveling at the time of firing. Some settings restrict your ability to change speed once a missile is fired, others allow you to exert control over the missile by changing speed once the missile is fired.\n\nIn games 19-21, the situation is reversed, you are the jet dropping bombs at the ships below. The controls in this setting are the same as in games 16-18. The difference, of course, is that you are dropping bombs from above at targets below.\n\nIn Games 22-27, one player is the jet and the other is the ship.\n\nEach of the two player games is a matter of who can hit more targets in (oddly enough) 2 minutes and 16 seconds. (The manual says that the game will also end if one player hits 99 targets. I have yet to see this happen.)

Anguna is loosely based on the original version of Anguna written for the Gameboy Advance in 2008. Development for the Atari 2600 version began in mid-2014.\n\nWhen you begin the game, you find yourself in a dungeon equipped with nothing but a sword. You must battle enemies, explore to escape your prison, and eventually find the evil Goblin King. As the game progresses, you'll find useful items (bow and arrow, lantern, winged boots, dynamite, etc.) as well as attack and defense powerups. As you defeat enemies, you will gain experience. After gaining enough experience, you level will advance, and your maximum health will increase.\n\nAs you explore the world, you will uncover many secrets. Defeating all the enemies in a room may uncover a hidden item or open hidden doors. Some walls are fake – occasionally you can walk through what appears to be a solid wall. Use your map for clues and try to explore every room! Some rooms are dark: you won't be able to see very far until you find the lantern. There are six keys scattered throughout the world. Each can be used to open doors corresponding to the color of the key.\n\nTo view your inventory, status, and world map, switch the Color/BW switch to BW. The status screen will be shown.

When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.\n\nThe player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.\n\nAsteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed.\n\nAlien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.\n\nGame Difficulty and Variations\nThere are 4 available difficulty settings: Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert.\n\nThe game also offers three different game variations:\n\n    Standard Play - For one or two players, taking turns when a player's ship is destroyed.\n\n    Competition Asteroids - Two players appear on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is in affect, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will destroy the other player's spaceship. Each player has separate ship reserves.\n\n    Team Asteroids - Two players on the screen at the same time. Friendly fire is disabled, which means shots fired from one player's spaceship will not destroy the other player's spaceship and just pass through.

While letting a meteor get past, the player will only lower the score; the player have to shoot the spinners. If one gets past, the player will lose a life.

You move him around a six-sided cube with nine squares to a side. The object is to get all nine sides to be one color each in the least amount of time or fewest moves, depending on the game variation you select.\n\nMarvin changes a space's color by standing on it and you pressing the fire button. Marvin will then exchange the color he is with the space. Marvin cannot move onto a space of the same color as he is.\n\nTo rotate the cube, just move to the edge and press the joystick in the direction to rotate.\n\nThe game variations allow for normal or fast speed or timed race or fewest moves. Other variations cause the cube to show all the spaces as black except when it rotates, so you don't know what color your on. Two of the game variations, one a timed race and the other a fewest moves challenge, restrict you rotations to up and right only, but do not black out the spaces.\n\nEight of the game variations have the computer play the game itself.\n\nThis game started out as Atari Video Cube but eventually was licensed under the Rubik's Cube name. This game is distinct from the similarly named game Rubik's Cube 3-D which is displayed in three dimensions so the player can see three of the cube faces at once rather than one.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvEMva3frvw","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"ad426db8-7157-4c58-a386-befb27c2a8fa.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"7fad55d5-286b-4fe5-8ddd-d96ab9dd05c4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"769360e6-ab3e-4119-a39c-172ca5f33483.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"041cf57e-a274-43ad-8be5-ff5f867f2307.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"daa49897-8f17-466b-b38e-4d511ca8396a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"f1764350-9da4-44c5-ac9c-b66075510c37.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"f886d624-6129-46b2-8971-c1eae4ab4ff1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"bcd5cf49-fce6-4679-9fc6-eb0c7fdfada9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"409e73c2-a33c-4188-bd39-8a9bd2f17ff8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"395247c3-893b-4705-b78f-b1a967880e3f.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17501,"FileName":"98a011b4-6cc1-4ed6-81bc-5031da5248b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":17501,"AlternateName":"Rubik's Cube","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":9272,"Name":"Atlantis","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"The lost city of Atlantis is under attack!

By taking it, you will find yourself in the next city. Each city is increasingly difficult, and the cop cars are faster and smarter.\n\nThere are 9 banks in each town, and you receive an increase in gasoline each time you rob one.

Games 1-4 allow the player to select one of the numbers the player will be working with, while 5-8 give random questions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cr1hBWIAVM","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Gary Palmer","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1977-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"8e1b3aaf-9a79-4fdf-981b-253f398cc79d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"1384791c-2d7d-4b09-a5a8-2773ea96e627.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"1f4e3a88-37c1-4bf7-9e42-c3b8f9515e6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"782be881-e96d-48a7-b9a3-987286656f22.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"67ea5bbc-f3a2-473e-916b-b38eae29a4f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"5b8170d2-0b69-4410-8329-94cc953b5c0b.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"069bd9af-273d-4f70-8558-11db66a3f5a7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"e4308d67-61a6-4b8c-a3df-8ba751a11be6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"8f9f2da8-7301-4133-a3be-9e6bca4a9762.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"8eabf6d4-9380-4ef3-98ba-763c2e08b0d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"b8a08e51-a4d5-409e-bedf-d7abe045f38a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"c1bf0ded-f455-4dbd-b145-6046c500f203.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10861,"FileName":"6694fa16-6053-43fd-91fc-3f4c1e979d15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":10861,"AlternateName":"Fun With Numbers","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":164703,"Name":"BASIC Programming","ReleaseYear":"1979","Overview":"BASIC Programming is an Atari 2600 cartridge that teaches simple computer programming.

Due to a 64 character limitation, and the Atari's own RAM size of 128 bytes, only extremely simple programs could be written and executed.

You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.\n\nA standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points when destroyed; a supertank is worth 3,000 points; and the flying saucer is worth 5,000 points. The guided missile is worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a single shot from the player's tank. One bonus tank (a bonus \"life\" or \"man\") is awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points; an additional tank is then awarded at 100,000 points. \nThe player can hide behind the solids or maneuver in rapid turns once fired on to buy time with which to fire himself.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo4bSrD4ZDQ","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Michael Feinstein","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"0b02f3cc-e1d7-4469-a55d-9e6459bb7f66.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"af3aedd2-5c3b-4056-bac6-af40ff528b5d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"c6a75ae9-07cd-4d83-bd7a-7a0d3ef15c78.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"bfc90adf-0458-4829-a739-8cb59dadc6fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"0a1991ac-c2a2-48c4-a6d5-9cdd31e75f52.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"adabea86-8813-462f-a2b9-6e4bb04d08a2.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"a2914e0d-caef-4ec3-b3fb-c0d71e27d7ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"dce8c579-6435-45f0-b85f-da21b571fa08.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"5f770f1c-3516-4098-843a-70e367926d9c.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"2e088083-9c50-47ac-95fb-e6cec238d115.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"03ccdd2f-cd21-4c3f-993c-3b66301f656a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"a2fc63ab-1721-4fa1-b4ad-3ff019a20a3c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"5c0af166-2f38-4204-943c-3aee3c969f01.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1343,"FileName":"f8b5a6ce-b423-4692-9805-c26c35224da6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17506,"Name":"Beamrider","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Beamrider is a 3D arcade action game.

You can swing at the ball to send it flying over to the net or block when your opponent is trying to get the ball past you. If the ball is about to fly over your head, you can head butt the ball in an attempt to prevent a point from being scored against you! Points are scored if the ball touches the floor or the ball flies out of bounds, but in order to score you must first successfully serve.\n\nBee-Ball supports single and two player play modes.

The problem was that the MindLink didn't work very well in initial test runs, and even when it did worked players would complain of headaches and dizziness from twitching their face. Bionic Breakthrough is really just Super Breakout with a title screen. It's unknown if this was just supposed to be a demo to show what the MindLink could do, or if it was actually a standalone product. Before the game starts there is a screen where the word MindLink slowly scrolls to the bottom, this is for callibration.

Thanks to 2600 programmers David Galloway and Bob Montgomery, you can now enjoy this classic handheld football game on the 2600 in the form of BLiP Football. Faithfully mimicked in appearance, audio and gameplay, BLiP Football recreates the experience of playing the original electronic football.\n\nIn BLiP Football you control a running back and must get by the defenders trying to stop your progress! You can see nine yards of the playing field at any time--when you go beyond one edge of the field, your player wraps around to the opposite edge, showing another nine yard segment of the field. The game is comprised of four 15-second quarters. On the fourth down you can optionally kick the ball instead of running it.\n\nIn addition to the default \"classic mode\" display (which shows red players against a black field), you can switch to an enhanced, more colorful display by pressing the SELECT switch during gameplay.

The blue print for the machine is at the bottom of the screen, so all you need to do is locate the parts which are hidden in the numerous houses in a maze like town. When you locate a part, drag it back and place it on the blue print. When all parts have been located, press the start button and the machine is ready to go! To make your task more difficult, there are several obstacles that get in the way. If you enter a house which doesn't contain a part, you will instead be stuck with a bomb. You will need to hurry and diffuse any bombs in the bomb pit before they explode! From time to time, a flower pot will fall from above and then hop off the screen. Get hit by a flower pot, and you lose a life. You also need to be careful of Fuzzy Wuzzy, who wanders around the neighborhood randomly. An encounter with Fuzzy Wuzzy will also be deadly! Hiding in the bomb pit is Sneaky Pete; while he isn't deadly, he will occasionally appear and press the start button before your machine is complete.

He will chase you around the play field and if he catches you, you lose one of your five lives. Pin starts at the top of a row and moves down. If you are hit by Pin, you pop and a life is lost.\n\nThe good thing about Pin, other than that it doesn't actively chase you, is that if it lands on the Bubble Eater, it will pop it, too. When the Bubble Eater is popped, it turns into a glowing puddle for a short time. While it is a puddle, you can bounce on it without getting hurt.\n\nGame variations\nThe game select switch just lets you start on levels one, two or three.\n\nLevels\nThere are 5 waves per level.\nLevel 1: The Bubble can bounce on any square and it will turn on and stay on.\nLevel 2: The same as level 1 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.\nLevel 3: The same as level 1 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.\nLevel 4: The Bubble can bounce on any square and turn it on, but if you bounce on it again it turns off then you must bounce on it once more to turn it on again.\nLevel 5: The same as level 4 but all the squares of a horizontal row must be turned on before you go to another row.\nLevel 6: The same as level 4 but you must turn on horizontal rows 2, 4 and 6 before you turn on rows 1, 3 or 5.\n\nScoring\nYou get 300 points the first time a Bubble Eater is popped in a wave.\nYou score points each time you turn on a step. In levels 4 to 6, you get points even if you are turning on a step a repeatedly.\nYou get points for completing a level and/or wave.

It's monkey business, for sure, and they need your help, so grab that trampoline, and start Bouncin' Baby Bunnies!!\n\nA copy of the nearly complete game surfaced in the collection of a former Telesys employee in 2007. According to programmer Alex Leavens, Bouncin' Baby Bunnies is based off the old Bugs Bunny cartoon, where the stork mistakenly delivers Bugs to a gorilla family and they think he's their baby. The only known prototype of Bouncin' Baby Bunnies seems to be fairly complete, but still needs some tweaks and bug fixes. The game didn't get released because of the collapsing game market of 83/84. According to the former Telesys employee: 'Bouncin' Baby Bunnies came too late in the 2600 cycle and, at the time, wasn't worth releasing. The market was saturated.'","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQjSkvdgtJk","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Alex Leavens","Publisher":"Telesys","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"87fc2171-c87f-4ba3-8c1f-7bddb1d98094.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"a8581fd7-2466-4e16-b104-53218f4a0bd2.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"6f732eb3-b238-4bff-a7b7-f51fe78ba658.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"bd6b7cf2-cc4a-4a33-b97f-e0f765ee4c15.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"d2cf451f-1b08-451e-86c2-d4fdb021ae34.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"272ef361-1af6-4a24-a30e-426d24086216.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"9c107da4-cd01-4473-a336-5169f50f3162.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158096,"FileName":"c8573858-f52a-41f3-8aac-c1ee01b16110.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22144,"Name":"Bowling","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your objective is to roll as high a score as possible, whether you're playing a one-player or a two-player game.

The object of the game is to use the bat at the bottom of the screen to keep the ball in play as you knock out bricks to score points.\n\nUsing the joystick controller you can move the bat left or right. Pressing the fire button launches the ball towards the bricks. Move the bat left or right to keep the ball in play. If the ball passes the bat you will lose a life and the ball will be reset on the bat ready to start again. If you lose all four lives the game is over.\nBrik\n\nEach level is patrolled by an enemy. If the ball hits the enemy the enemy is destroyed, but the ball's angle will change and speed will temporarily be increased. Destroying a brick sometimes reveals a bonus hidden underneath it, which will then fall towards the bottom of the screen. These bonuses can be collected by your bat.\n\nBrik also includes Brik 180, a new twist on the classic brick breaking genre, featuring unique levels, dual bats, and a rotated play area. Brik 180 differs from similar games by the use of two bats, one at the left side of the screen and another at the right side. The player controls both bats simultaneously, requiring great skill and fast reactions.\n\nBrik includes game cartridge and eight-page, full-color manual.

Who could forget those chubby little dolls that started fist fights between middle aged housewives in toy stores?  For some reason every kid had to have one of these creepy little kewpie dolls back in the 80's, although the fad eventually faded.  Since Cabbage Patch Kids just happened to be manufactured by Coleco, it was only natural that they would create a video game tie in.  While the Colecovision version of Cabbage Patch Kids was released to much success, the Atari 2600 version never materialized.\n\nIf you're scratching your head as to how someone could create a game based on a line of dolls, you're not alone.  Dolls don't exactly inspire video games.  However Coleco got around this by taking an existing game for the MSX line of computers called Athletic Land and adding the Cabbage Patch Kids into the game.  Since the MSX computer was never released in the US, people were none the wiser.  This is also why a game that was supposedly aimed at children seems so damn hard.\n\nCabbage Patch Kids: Adventures in the Park (which will be henceforth referred to as CPK) is a side scrolling action game.  According to the Colecovision version's manual, Anna Lee has decided to go out for some exercise in the local park and is soon caught up in a wild adventure (hence the subtitle Adventures in the Park).  The game is separated into several different screens (referred to in the game as scenes), each with a different obstacle for your kid to overcome.  Obstacles include bouncing balls, water filled pits, floating platforms, bees, and even fires.  Each level consists of ten scenes which must all be overcome before the time limit runs out.  Along the way Anna may also collect various objects hidden in the trees (using well placed trampolines) for points, but these objects are not necessary to win.\n\nCPK was known to exist for some time thanks to an interview conducted with another former Coleco programmer Ed English several years ago.  Ed was thought to be in possession of the only known prototype, but he would not release it for unknown reasons.  However in 2008 several Coleco EPROMs were found in a flea market, several of which contained various versions of CPK.  These EPROMs were released to the public shortly afterwards.\n\nWhile it may not be able to compare graphically to the Colecovision version, the Atari 2600 version of CPK is an amazing feat of programming.  Not only was all the gameplay retained in this conversion, but it even included a cute little background tune which was a rarity in 2600 games.  It appears that CPK was simply a victim of the collapsing game market, and by the time the final version was ready in September of 1984, Coleco had stopped its 2600 operations.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v1GhGQnQOo","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Ed Temple","Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"9b8c87e7-7449-4cde-9c33-7f6647eaa1a1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"df677c7b-2b9b-4036-a924-84a458ef83d6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"e755e693-0221-4f1d-a9e3-13219ac58d95.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"6d03902a-4246-4dc4-a140-16c61491d074.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"cac71dcb-ba91-440f-835d-81e6976be9bf.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"96e26d1d-5b7c-4423-9359-ade20d961daa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"953e1615-d146-4524-91e6-50813d8c6c9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":109840,"FileName":"7a464759-37b1-4014-af34-903ae49274d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31848,"Name":"Cakewalk","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You must catch pastries from six conveyor belts before they fall on the floor.

It's not an easy task.  You've got six misses in which to match wits with the computer for a higher score.  Each time the bricks in the canyon are hit, the remaining bricks \"fall\" to a lower level (rather than remaining stationary in their original position).  Bricks that fall to a lower level are worth the points designated for that level.\n\nKeep an eye on the solid bar beneath your score on the upper right side of the screen.  It is a \"miss indicator\" and gradually decreases in length each time you miss until six misses are recorded and the game ends.  The bar is also color-coordinated with your planes and your score.\n\nSet your sights for 1000 points.  Although the game will not end if you reach the 1000 point mark, it's an excellent goal to set for yourself since it will be very difficult to obtain.\n\n\nGAME 2 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):\n\nThis game differs from Game 1 only in that you are competing against another player rather than the computer.  Play ends when six misses are recorded against both players.  the player with the highest score wins. \n\nDon't forget to keep an eye on your opponent's \"miss indicator\" as well as your own.  Bombs away!\n\n\nGAME 3 - Canyon Bomber (One-Player):\n\nThis one's the same as Game 1 with one exception.  Rather than falling to a lower level, the bricks in the canyon stay \"suspended\" in their original position when the surrounding bricks are hit.\n\n\nGAME 4 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):\n\nYou compete with another player the same as in Game 2.  This time however, the brick remain suspended instead of falling to a lower level.\n\n\nGAME 5 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):\n\nGet set for a test of your endurance and concentration.  The first player to score 1000 points wins.  No time limit and no limit to the number of bombs or misses.  Falling, rather than suspended bricks are programed into this game.\n\nNo \"miss indicator\" will appear on the screen in games with unlimited bombs.\n\n\nGAME 6 - Canyon Bomber (Two-Player):\n\nThis game program is identical to Game 5, except that the bricks stay suspended.\n\n\nSEA BOMBER GAMES\n\nGAME 7 - Sea Bomber (One-Player):\n\nYou're playing against the computer.  Set the level, release the bomb, and boom, you're ready for action.  Sounds easy, but the computer's a real steady competitor.  If you score 1000 points before the computer does, you're a winner!\n\n\nGAME 8 - Sea Bomber (Two-Player):\n\nThis time you're competing against another player in a race to the 1000 point mark.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcgjkcCbZzc","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1979-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"6c4b80ef-3ff8-40e5-bf6b-638c6c1e5bea.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"bd8bbf30-4d9f-406d-b841-40909bda3a5f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"aeddb332-1d1d-437d-9109-850981d42fc2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"002e7c46-c4c7-48f2-b153-7b1b19b0bbfd.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"3d1aa2e9-02b1-45c7-8bb8-9fbe75650755.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"aedfa5c2-c1c6-47b1-a0d4-1ac376125797.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"a5ebc22c-9976-45ec-b4db-9928460c94ad.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"e85d787e-7321-4462-92d4-ee99b0076edd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"7602a272-f228-4364-b8cc-041c471d56b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"94c42728-e6ca-4443-850e-e0e63c06254e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"f9f52f27-6bdb-4202-81c3-a4df9c05ce82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22147,"FileName":"2de9467a-e33b-4c07-881d-4a20439917fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132270,"Name":"Care Bears","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The game concept in Care Bears revolves around grabbing the \"Tummy Icon\" from each of the Care Bears as they slowly fell down the screen.  Once all the icons were collected the player would have to arrange them in a certain order before time ran out.  Although this may sound rather easy, one has to keep in mind that the game was geared toward young children, so things had to be kept simplistic.\n\nCare Bears made it to the beta testing stage before the marketing department decided to stop work on the game citing that the market for childrens games was diminishing, and the gameplay was too dull. Therefore it was decided that all further development on the game was to be stopped. According to programmer Laura Nikolich, part of the reason Care Bears was killed off, was that the marketing department really didn't know what they wanted. The Care Bears product line was aimed at the 8 and under age group, but marketing wanted a more action oriented game designed for older kids. Although Nikolich described the game as being almost finished, the only known prototype to surface is nothing more than a graphics demo.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Laura Nikolich","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"4ac27772-131e-4432-b24c-eaaa5e6b41fe.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"9c20bac1-8b15-4e8e-880c-b1b3b5111f7b.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"af9f9450-dccb-4998-ae52-40faa652775e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"99a5cb83-227a-4141-b6b7-d7f5a7bcd3ec.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"dc15a95f-ba18-49db-a7bf-7b5f312dcdb5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"8b1d16b5-0ef1-414a-a2b0-efbfa7c84aab.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132270,"FileName":"c767189d-379f-4e67-b57d-765ac8a5c282.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":27359,"Name":"Carnival","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this adaptation of the original arcade game by Sega, try to prove your skill at hitting targets in a carnival shooting gallery.

Your Indiana Jones-like avatar searches through many brick-lined rooms looking for three keys that will open up the locked rooms.  There is an enemy (scorpion, hawk, wolf, etc,) to be dealt with in almost every room, and they can drain your strength if you come into contact with them.  There are three difficulty settings: normal, intermediate and fast.  Only the first version starts you off with a revolver to defend yourself and has static key locations.  I was able to find the three keys in the normal version, but still was only able to open two doors.  Once you open a door and kill the enemy in these rooms, it triggers a booby trap of falling bricks that must be avoided.  The crown pieces are guarded by a boss figure.  It doesn’t appear that the rooms have to be done in any specific order, so I am stumped as to what it takes.  I have not gotten very far in the harder versions.  I got caught up in trying to solve the normal version.\n\nAmong the many graphic features: a transport room, medicine packs for slight replenishment, a sinkhole for fully restoring health, a shield for some protection, lava rooms with walls that are harmful, a dark maze that is visible only by torchlight, a rail car that you can ride across a room (if you avoid the falling rocks), and a rolling boulder.\n\nI was able to get in and out of the dark room from the top, but I never found another exit.  Somehow (at least I think so), I found an additional room and also a way into the dark room from the bottom.  There is also another hidden room that can be found by falling through a hole that must have some significance.  The graphics are quite nice and extensive for the system and all walls shake when you touch them for a little drama.  The sound is OK.  The challenge involved in trying to solve the game is addictive and makes for good replay value.\n\nCave In is a 32K cartridge.  It is AtariAge’s first Atari 2600 homebrew that they have published with additional on­board RAM, doubling the amount of RAM available to the game!  This memory in Cave In uses the same SARA \"SuperChip\" technology Atari developed for some of their more advanced games, including Crystal Castles, Jr. Pac-Man, and Stargate.  The programmer, Steve Engelhardt, utilized the programming language Batari BASIC (and some assembly language routines) to create the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nl4YESHFSA","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Steve Engelhardt","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"9c443b64-8ae3-479e-9607-a4ed53f67bf3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"227be45e-87d8-4451-96e3-c626cfbde713.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"da336f76-4e3b-4be8-8e9c-910504b9a7c3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"22d6a684-2438-4f8d-8aa0-4a160346e765.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"430b907e-b3a2-4964-ab97-f7b1bd21b0c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"4fe65369-43f4-4169-b59e-490b92dfc8ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":109841,"FileName":"e8231e1d-7b45-40c7-8028-dbeda6826236.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138082,"Name":"Caverns of Mars","ReleaseYear":"2017","Overview":"Caverns of Mars is a computer game originally made for the Atari 8-bit computers, programmed by Greg Christensen and published by Atari Program Exchange (APX) in 1981.

The game was developed to a prototype stage for the Atari 2600, but wasn't released on the console.

Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves.\n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands.\n\nInsect Opponents and Mushrooms\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\n\n    The Centipede\n    The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\n    Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\n    The Spider\n    The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.\n\n    The Flea\n    The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\n    The Scorpion\n    The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\n    Mushrooms\n    Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom. \n\n\nGame Difficulty and Variations\nThe game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:\n\n    One Player\n    Two Player Alternating\n    Two players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\n    Dual Player Competition\n    Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\n    Team Play Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player. \n\n\nScoring\nThe player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:\n\n    Centipede Head - 100 points\n    Centipede Body Segment - 10 points\n    Spider at close range - 900 points\n    Spider at medium range - 600 points\n    Flea - 200 points\n    Scorpion - 1,000 points\n    Restored mushroom - 5 points\n    Destroyed mushroom - 1 points","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcB_B03Cx5I","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"36b154ad-2071-40d0-8cfa-dd5a12b7cb44.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"ce3dca4e-701b-4442-9ac6-3f10b5e41701.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"40becb00-5691-4380-aa73-aba44df6f9ad.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"c1a8f641-18d7-46ed-b6af-f3401fcece3c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"d1f7e571-ac4e-4315-becb-51b6b3069664.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"1adf5c1f-710e-4f2c-831f-24aa1d8a83f4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"7b429366-dbfd-4214-8b0d-317c97db9ec2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"c0abdbb3-e512-4784-a12f-cb66968a895f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"76399481-ea70-4b24-8ade-6b67873eb974.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"52396e59-0bcf-4435-a70c-767d1b1e1d3e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"eb2003bc-ce71-49df-ba59-1641b5dabb26.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"78c8f0c4-39a5-4cde-a843-4d8d824c881d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"497a6b2b-4265-40f0-a7a9-22a95aac0021.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"9ae604dd-edb7-4d49-af15-f3d4ebf73f88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1346,"FileName":"a0c865f7-9b40-4137-83f2-9f3010e209f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136686,"Name":"CGE Adventures","ReleaseYear":"2013","Overview":"This game is based on a true story.

Completing a stage earns an extra life on top of the six lives the player starts the game with and brings the player to the next stage which has increased difficulty due to more creatures being added.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNAZWOg5Y2Q","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Zellers","Publisher":"Funvision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"28ada773-faba-474a-80b6-211c34a9609e.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"e490f5bb-6d3c-4c1a-829c-e534d09aa511.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"5c324f9c-9c2b-4384-a64e-0c55aa843b06.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"9e5f5b72-1b21-4260-af6f-70020be5ea97.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"8ac43ea0-d982-4c75-b3be-bcd73e85d9b0.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"f6d25b24-8661-441d-993e-b5d6a4cc2d7e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"29b348d0-6a9a-4d10-8cea-0c26c87f1e2c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"dfa7d4d3-2bcc-4d2c-98ff-eb72fb382337.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"6983c3cf-0a09-4ae9-9aa1-2350bee8b67d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"FileName":"0cb35da3-f0dd-4282-8696-1aaba9354030.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Germany"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22148,"AlternateName":"Mein Weg","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":22148,"AlternateName":"My Way","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":20287,"Name":"Championship Soccer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In this soccer game, each team has one forward, two backs and a goalie.

The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wka7LenS87g","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Robert Weatherby","Publisher":"Xonox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"c3337b10-af06-483a-89f3-5caeffa6ecee.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"245a2c7d-6ae8-414d-8b4c-a3770574452e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"27fda811-688f-4f4f-a486-6ac8aef1e2e6.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"783d14a7-7db2-4eb3-907a-da3f7a53f392.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"ef4686e4-7a16-47eb-9c2b-097114b41bcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"d1a9bf9c-8002-4000-81cd-c9fd8f813f4d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"f9673d4b-54f2-4c5a-8355-53d10bd45a3b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"80603cdd-2d47-471d-a2aa-c2fd32d196b1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"f2af085c-c61a-468c-9564-804c183846ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"FileName":"919e1568-604a-4765-8b9c-75367dd23727.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":122731,"AlternateName":"Super Kung-Fu","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":122731,"AlternateName":"Kung Fu Superkicks: Pursuit of the Ninja","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":174405,"Name":"Chunkout 2600","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Chunkout, you take on the dangerous role of Commander Brock Starblaze as he attacks the defenses of the legendary Xotec homeworld. Using your precision Atari Joystick, you will help him guide the CX-40 Voidstar's Photon Laser Device to take apart the Xotec Pulsar fields particle by particle.\n\nIt won't be easy. The Pulsar fields get harder the farther in you go. Your Z2PA Advanced Calculation Computer will show you a view of the Pulsar field at the atomic level. Each block is a single particle in the overall field. Particles come in several colors, and these tend to be grouped into larger groups of the same color, due to the subatomic structure of the Xotec fields. The Scientific types are calling them 'Microconglomerate Quantum Phase Packets', but our R&D boys just call them 'chunks'.\n\nEach chunk of the Pulsar Field can be burned away with a nanosecond pulse of the Voidstar's Photon Laser. One pulse destroys all connecting particles of the same color. As you burn away chunks of the field, the other particles will rearrange themselves. Particles of similar color will form larger chunks, and that is the key to success. Skillful use of the Photon Laser will allow you to combine, and then eliminate all of the particles in the current Pulsar Field, and then it's further down into the Xotec defenses as you systematically burrow through the Pulsar Fields. Reach the homeworld, and the war is over.\n\nThe further in you go, the tougher things get. The inner defenses of the Xotec homeworld are very tricky. Scans show that the particle distribution becomes very difficult, and the chunks get continually smaller, forcing you to use all of your abilities to combine them in to big enough chunks. No one ever said this would be a cake walk.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"James Todd","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":174405,"FileName":"ba6bc490-b1d9-4cc5-9431-cd10d75ef57e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5301,"Name":"Circus Atari","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pop the balloons and score points.

It was released as one of the nine launch titles for the system in October 1977, and was included in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982. \n\nCombat is a two-player game where the players attempt to shoot each other's tanks or planes. Hitting the enemy vehicle pushes it back and gives the player one point. The game contains 27 levels, each of which has different rules and playing field layout. On the tank levels, the players have a selection of two different mazes or no walls at all, while on the plane levels, the players can choose to play with clouds that obscure part of the screen. The Atari 2600 difficulty settings can be used to change the range of a player's missiles, as well as the speed of one's airplanes in levels 15-27. All games have a time limit of 136 seconds.\n\nThe levels include:\n\n    1-5: Tank levels. Levels 3 and 5 are \"straight missile\" levels where the players' projectiles simply fly forward. On the \"guided missile\" levels (1, 2, 4) the projectiles can be controlled with a joystick after firing.\n    6-9: \"Tank-pong\" levels, where the players' missiles bounce off walls. In the \"billiard hit\" levels (8 and 9), there's an additional rule that a missile must bounce at least once before it can hit the enemy tank.\n    10 and 11: Invisible tank levels, where the tanks only become briefly visible when they shoot, bump into a wall, or are hit by a missile. Both of these give the players guided missiles.\n    12-14: Invisible \"tank-pong\" levels. Levels 13 and 14 use the \"billiard hit\" rule.\n    15-20: Biplane levels, where the players fly planes that are constantly moving forward and wrap around to the other side when they fly off the screen. Levels 15 and 19 use guided missiles; 16 and 20 use straight missiles; on 17 and 18 the players use rapid-fire machine guns. Additionally level 19 is a \"2 vs. 2\" level - both players have two planes each that move and shoot together - and level 20 is \"1 vs. 3\", where one player has three planes while the other has a single large plane.\n    21-27: Jet fighter levels. The jet planes move faster than biplanes, but other than that gameplay remains similar. 22, 24 and 27 are straight missile levels, the rest are guided missile levels. Additionally 25 and 27 are \"2 vs. 2\" levels, while 26 is a \"1 vs. 3\" level.\n\nOne of the very few Atari 2600 games actually programmed to be in stereo (which can only be experienced with a modified system).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E8xnaWm2Cg","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Larry Wagner","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1977-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"b3a91e63-352a-4c46-a888-b97a743d3858.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"e91b7eb3-7af1-47f5-8319-a9be975481f6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"d3c183e6-f538-4590-8182-d055141c748f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"34662805-3415-40f6-8ae7-fa5a8e68e6ec.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"b8217b26-87ce-45ad-b84f-1ed14c85e681.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"7fee8f62-c5e8-40e5-877d-b4623626588d.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"e9b2370d-dc57-4937-92da-b38f9dd60ba7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"0d517398-1171-4e9d-a78e-0b2855897ab3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"2addcdea-5cd8-497e-a4f6-536ac7b4c693.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"39c22024-f843-44d5-88fd-64bdb8e06e89.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"bfee20ff-17f1-4256-b133-c6fe04805d7a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"a08f42d4-b456-47a1-a19b-7e339dc3a1fa.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"502eb1ad-cbcb-4937-91c7-2d6e4d4825aa.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"FileName":"9983a15e-c2ff-42e8-83fe-b8418ef7301a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":4887,"AlternateName":"Tank-Plus","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4887,"AlternateName":"Combat  ~ Tank-Plus","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":4887,"AlternateName":"Frontline","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"AlternateName":"Tank-Plus","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":4887,"AlternateName":"Combat: Tank-Plus","Region":"United States"}]},{"DatabaseID":24906,"Name":"Combat Two","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Combat 2 is video game for the Atari 2600. Originally announced in 1982, it was subsequently cancelled. Developed by Atari, the game was supposed to be the sequel to the classic Atari VCS game Combat, which was bundled with the system. In 2005 it finally saw release on the Atari Flashback 2 dedicated console, and has seen two subsequent releases, the first in the 2011 Nintendo DS compilation Atari's Greatest Hits Volume II and the second in the iPhone and Android app Atari Greatest Hits, initially released in 2012.\n\nEnvironments were an arena with a river in the middle with two bridges, forests that the tanks can use for cover, and brick walls that could be shot through or used for cover. The tanks themselves moved by themselves with the player turning the tank and controlling the speed. This game had three lives that could be used — three hits and the player loses a life — while the original allowed you to get as many shots in until the time ran out. The graphics overall were improved over the original.\n\nThe game was cancelled, probably due to the video game crash of 1983, and was forgotten until 200 copies of the prototype were produced in cartridge form and sold at the Classic Gaming Expo in 2001. The prototype featured the unfinished game, which included the features listed above, but people were surprised to find a level editor inside the game.\n\nThe game was featured in Retro Gamer Issue 15 in the \"Games That Weren't\" section.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSDfWuxc_xU","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting; Strategy","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"7bf89506-f07b-4a00-b5a7-effafbe0320d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"3c9f5004-b5c4-466f-a7ea-0eb002b90077.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"8f369f15-4f9d-46b1-ac28-545dba4bb1a2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"2fc3ed09-f056-4ed9-bf94-a4125b435a36.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"c86498b7-b086-4b99-a19c-9ae082196f42.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"a6d21011-854a-4dbc-ba23-fddd9a686646.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"482e2ffe-749f-4ece-a788-5e4a2662e5f2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"934d6b2a-d8b8-4c1d-aecc-f302bb76d854.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"d0648ad7-19fa-4fa4-8a28-12f8dbbcccee.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"7e06dbec-4169-4ce6-a685-756186c20200.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"806b6be7-273f-4db3-be85-64fb5fa4d40a.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"032e081b-b5d3-4b4e-881b-31298b5d29bf.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"4a5039d1-98d5-4651-80a6-e331cda1ee83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24906,"FileName":"989ef028-5d69-42fd-98e0-70f43cd6e782.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":24906,"AlternateName":"Combat II","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":206,"Name":"Commando","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Super Joe is armed with a sub-machine gun (which has unlimited ammunition) as well as a limited supply of hand grenades.

Video Chess is the game that led Atari to first invent bank-switched ROMs for the Atari 2600, even though the shipping version of the game wouldn't use the technique and was only 4K in size.\n\nThis is an early home chess game. The standard U. S. chess rules are used in this game. To move a piece, place the X on the board onto the piece to be moved then press the red button. Next, move the X to where you want the piece to go and press the button again. If the move is illegal, the 2600 will give a warning sound and not make the move.\n\nTo castle your king, the king and rook must not have been moved. You move your king two squares in the direction of the rook to castle with. The 2600 will then automatically move your rook around your king, completing the move. You cannot castle out of check and you cannot castle to the king's side if any squares between the king and rook are threatened.\n\nAnother maneuver is called en passant. This move is used to counteract the enemy pawn's initial double move on a adjacent square. To carry out the en passant, you must advance your pawn to the fifth rank.

You are our last hope! You must protect the Cosmic Kids from the Cosmic Creeps as they escape the orbit-decaying planet!\n\nThe first part of the game is The Voyage. You begin on the bottom in your Orbinaut. You must move to the space station at the top while avoiding plasma, which moves from top to bottom, and Space Skeeters, which move left to right or right to left. If you are hit by anything, you will spin off into space and must begin again. Releasing a new Orbinaut, however, also causes the planet to decay a little more\n\nThe second part of the game is The Rescue. A Cosmic Kid starts at the bottom left of the screen and moves to the right then goes up one level moving left, all the while being chased by one or two Cosmic Creeps. You, using the space station, must fire and time your shots to hit a Creep, sending them back to the bottom. If your shot hits the Kid, a new Kid must start at the bottom and the planet's orbit decays a little more.\n\nIf the planet's orbit decays completely or if a Cosmic Creep gets to the upper right of the screen, the game is over. You get 100 points for each Creep you shoot and 1500 points for each Kid you get to safety. You need to score 5000 points on the Rescue screen to advance to the next level, where you will start the Voyage again, only faster.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD9GVnJkAqU","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Don Ruffcorn","Publisher":"Telesys","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"49275205-e105-425a-bae3-14acf545bebc.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"674fd957-b282-4ce9-b619-b9389e9f5a5d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"38410808-34d8-4cbf-841b-367918c3b779.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"ea86f533-29df-431a-b162-864057f45297.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"06100fb2-3826-473a-a070-e0751f15b992.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"f4dc6c43-dd58-48f3-ad2a-b5655da9de3f.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"c88ca4b4-98cc-4b45-9f39-0d049ad9181f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"06ff017f-844f-45c3-a49c-2c3742b383b5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"9f4b729b-9524-4632-b732-a329db20aa2f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"74898255-694b-433c-9ce6-f145868f5107.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":28706,"FileName":"d9382c17-33bc-40d3-94cb-b8b17f4440f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138637,"Name":"Cosmic Invaders","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_0BNTCxR0","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138637,"FileName":"57a9f83e-553d-4c51-afcc-6083b4128150.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138637,"FileName":"e350080b-fcb8-43b9-9fba-8b77bd504bed.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138637,"FileName":"32929b6b-d02e-46a4-971e-c489a200ecba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138637,"FileName":"02b6ae97-a965-4a0c-9bc4-9f9a82afdf8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138637,"FileName":"431aec5f-907c-44bc-8279-93dc11b111bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31853,"Name":"Cosmic Swarm","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are at the Waypoint Interstellar Trade Depot, a quiet outpost in space, when suddenly a dormant group of alien, mineral-eating termites awakens.

As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down. While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:\n\n    Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.\n    Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.\n    Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.\n    Electrical \"Nichibutsu\" signs with a dangling live wire.\n    Falling \"Crazy Climber\" signs.\n    King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.\n\nThe climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes.\n\nCrazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is \"The Lucky Balloon\", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ga2ClKOpppc","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nihon Bussan","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"c943856a-e69e-43f8-8322-25956e9d894b.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"e259d4bf-c6e3-43bb-9c48-67222afd10ba.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"5b001525-a96d-47b4-b8a8-ebba9752d20e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"ee9fa09c-f36b-4ffa-9dd6-be3140529023.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"cbde97d0-5a73-45fc-9b6a-688e53c4d21d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"72a0ba51-243d-4a64-83b4-5bc66fc15f43.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"c21808b2-91ad-4e4f-8a2a-9a1300106db4.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"e79aa243-5c5d-4207-a347-cc17dd4ca310.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"d049e8e3-2d06-4d16-948f-d9184d376fdb.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"11d28b92-ec3a-4689-b615-28b6b47d3b6c.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"007a4e3e-ada3-4ce3-9547-8034e77faf9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8352,"FileName":"d1e4c1df-56a1-40ce-a5a8-a9ae403dc6a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":97156,"Name":"Crazy Valet","ReleaseYear":"2000","Overview":"Programmed and published by one Brian Prescott, Crazy Valet is a puzzle game where the objective is to remove your car from a crowded parking lot, but in order to do so you need to first move cars that are in your way.

The rarity and legend of this game make it potentially the most sought-after 2600 game in existence.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrRsYxiAoV0","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Rob Fulop","Publisher":"Imagic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"913eddd5-7e04-496d-a88a-0b9f1b1afa68.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"eb6f6c2f-8613-4e77-935c-6dcec8dd616f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"3e5fc131-6bee-46a2-afd9-13e9601603df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"621cde8c-639e-4393-bf21-388b57520b25.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"bb4f65cb-f628-4a35-b941-b687cb600176.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"b78eaf0b-d381-420c-87b2-1e216fd94229.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"3f5849aa-3881-4b98-bef6-b4e5a26f0cfa.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"60880689-105a-45ae-b2a5-04c564ad94ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":31856,"FileName":"bafc8e2f-724d-47d2-bad7-f34fc8d7f985.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138650,"Name":"Cubis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Cubis 2 is a puzzle video game that was released in 2004 by FreshGames.

You are an explorer in an underground maze; your goal is to survive the 26 different levels and collect as many of the hidden treasures as you can.

Trying to stop you from completing your quest are a wide variety of creatures, including zombies, wraiths, skeletons, wizards, and the grim reaper. Each of the creatures in the game has a different strength; when you shoot a creature, it will transform into the next weaker creature. Eventually a creature will become the weakest one (a zombie) at which point it can be destroyed. In addition to the creatures and treasures, other items that can be found in the maze are keys (to open doors), potions (to restore health), poison (drains health), guns (increases your firing rate), traps, shields, and bombs. The game is played from an overhead point of view, and is for one player or two players simultaneously.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Adam Clayton","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"d33a2866-b3ab-4d4a-b17a-90a6b0f5ca15.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"0e10b163-1275-462a-8b96-ee0d43be0154.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"67151a58-d035-4075-96b5-c6579134dfe8.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"efab02da-7a47-4d17-9218-0a0c0c895de6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"5070b665-5bc5-4700-ac27-e84c6dedef91.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"253e2315-b947-49cd-8a2e-cff77200c85f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"76780913-787a-44d4-b79a-5a8a01adae48.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"23d3346a-f6dc-4c0c-af68-13e567030ee8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"7ad664f0-00fb-464e-b317-7ee6bffd6371.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"e4b35daa-27f8-4a72-ba1c-0100393147c0.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"ee60c8ad-bf63-4769-b7b2-3ae47ad58eee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1366,"FileName":"f438a116-c0f9-4085-b918-21028b1bcf0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136719,"Name":"Dark Mage","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Dark Mage, you play the role of a jester banished from your kingdom and your goal is to find and return the king's black rose.

Suddenly, you run into the giant ship IT. IT doesn't want that message to get to the Galactic Emperor. You must destroy all three power generators to escape. One generator is hidden until the other two are destroyed.\n\nIT is protected by three shields above you; which are A, B, and C, from top to bottom. There is a forth shield, D, below you. Touching any shield is instant game over. IT also has guided fireballs that chase your ship for a short distance. Getting hit by these too many times will kill you. If you can avoid getting hit long enough, your repair crew might can undo some of the damage (see Game variations below)\n\nYou use the joystick to move the ship, left, right, up or down. Press the fire button to launch a torpedo. If you keep the fire button down, you can guide the torpedo left or right or accelerate it. Be advised, though, that you ship isn't moving while you are guiding the torpedo and could get damaged or destroyed.\n\nAs you damage IT's generators, shields A, B, and C will get invulnerable sections. These move across the shields, making it harder to get shots through the longer you play. If you do not hit the left or right generators for 15 seconds, IT will lower shield C, reducing your maneuvering room. You will also lose points (see Scoring below).\n\nAfter you destroy the left and right generators, the center generator will be visible. When you destroy that, you win the game. However, as you hit the center generator, shield D will raise so you must work fast as possible.\n\nYou start with six ships at the bottom of the screen. Each time a fireball hits you, you lose a ship. Lose them all and the game is over.\n\nGame variations\nAfter you press the fire button to select your joystick, you then choose your difficulty by moving the joystick up or down.\n\nThe difficulty settings are:\nEasy (the square)=Fireball firing rate is slow, invulnerable shield segments are small, you have a repair crew.\nNormal (the X)=Fireball firing rate is normal, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you have a repair crew.\nHard (the diamond)=Fireball firing rate is fast, invulnerable shield segments are normal, you do not have a repair crew. That means any lost ships from fireball strikes are never regained.\n\nThe difficulty switches are not used. After you have the setting you want, move the joystick to the right to begin the game.\n\nScoring\nReadiness=Every few seconds, you get 1 point for each ship at the bottom of the screen, up to a maximum of 6.\nDamage=The number of hits to a generator multiplied by ten. For instance, the first hit is 10 points, the 7th hit is 70 points, the 12th hit is 120 points, etc.\nDestroy the left or right generator=2000 points\nDestroy the center generator=5000 points\nShield C lowers=lose 90 points, although your score will never be lower than zero.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_djZwZBz14","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Jim Jacob","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"12fe849c-656c-46a1-82db-8ba134949a90.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"9d3fe817-60ce-42e6-a6d2-c1b36313cb8a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"b3aaf9a5-afc8-4888-bdfb-840dc19d224b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"851f20c3-cce5-4b79-a2b2-9223726ceb6b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"612db479-0919-4776-80fe-088b9259a291.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"b1713687-b414-403e-8be0-6911bc46f9a6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"88d783da-e57c-48b6-807c-0fd4cc4bea9e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"a129e016-f8e8-414b-91f5-976560c8a9fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"a3e306e7-d0c8-4197-bca3-123ca8a093ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"b53b9f6b-3520-4828-b1ce-4f7c394e853e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31857,"FileName":"b6a2a6e9-cfe9-4242-aebb-92762ffe3c58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1347,"Name":"Defender","ReleaseYear":"1980","Overview":"Defender is a two-dimensional, side-scrolling shooting game set on the surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are successfully abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three chances (lives) to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjdEsciNRjE","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"9db6b633-6533-4bc4-9a5d-1ec0c6fcefeb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"01032ee1-2e6e-4be1-9c88-bfb7627794ff.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"008f9c4f-7551-4e79-ac3c-f6df0bd8f512.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"75e181d6-6a37-49fc-9d7d-e7b2dd2418a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"7072afbb-948b-422d-aae8-2824a1dc524e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"e8fb3487-ea98-4a98-a58c-426ffc8b6192.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"c8763ee0-1640-40df-b44d-3bae01fee3ee.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"e4b0d584-9bbb-47c5-9b8c-280aac64e288.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"ebdfd2fb-e875-4ca7-ac5d-fd6fec807897.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"28691675-04aa-4642-bf12-9b6bd148f242.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"fe650c2a-2b92-4d34-afde-fbfe7378c3d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"aeacfc8c-a7d5-4924-a5a1-d7d31d3b3654.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"bffe2196-ded9-4c03-92c4-57eb86de5d34.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"e452f313-8955-4286-9627-1e68ce351143.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"8d17d74d-75c1-48ff-8fc6-aaba73d2f9cc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"ad1e2964-4aea-45cd-8bb3-29262f9bf6ec.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"3ad81eb2-89db-4dd9-aebc-b0d14a233acb.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"820a68f5-f5a4-4b2d-b6b7-d6cfb2cc1fde.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"7f82d697-4058-4cd2-94d8-7e46acc59c74.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"f1f61f7b-0055-40ef-9150-97c19b79a6c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"fc3f29d7-ea22-49e2-912c-4aa0d47f2e2f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"194f3355-8763-42c4-a6cd-c46a1a00ce5b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"3b245fd1-0144-4dc9-8615-2894e6bd8022.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1347,"FileName":"85e10446-946e-4ee2-9afe-dc6c80ac765f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":1347,"AlternateName":"Earth Attack","Region":"Canada"}]},{"DatabaseID":1367,"Name":"Defender II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This sequel adds new enemy ships to the alien fleet such as firebombers, Yllabian Space Guppies (note that Yllabian is based on \"Yllab\", the word \"Bally\" spelled backwards, a friendly poke at Williams' then-competitor, Bally Midway), Dynamos and Space Hums.

See how quickly (or in how many moves) you can do it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDTV0a6zpew","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sancho / Tang's Electronic Co.","Publisher":"Panda","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"fc1ec491-7593-4511-8822-fdbeba06d81c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"c8b8bc5f-7263-4056-856a-0aa24485a945.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"f78e6afa-166e-4488-8d95-89af07dfeda5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"eaac80ed-af1f-4e69-bca7-6694ded0e831.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"c33d74aa-59ac-4f8d-9661-f770776f45ad.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"7a0e629f-018c-4c34-9c48-6d91814157f8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"ca2b90f3-aca9-41c6-99f3-136d7e64776b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"9f782a9f-3f3a-47a2-952c-2d42638d5ce2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"c670cdff-4e14-4cb3-9f88-962b2eaf3129.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"d91d6f38-0717-4c0f-951a-661359395700.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"dee2a839-aa9e-46e4-8272-2da36bfd95aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31859,"FileName":"c6682e20-8570-42aa-8307-703a299eb603.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":207,"Name":"Dig Dug","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.

The player controls a girl attempting to keep a group of several spinning plates balanced on poles from falling. The game received negative reviews; criticism focused on the game's repetition and monotony.\n\nThe girl can stabilize wobbling dishes by pressing the button on the controller. If a plate falls, the player is able to capture it if the girl touches it before it hits the ground, and a new one appears at the top of the pole. The number of poles to spin varies between the selected skill level; there are six on the easiest setting, and ten on the hardest. The player loses if they let four dishes hit the ground","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtswgaNQ_2E","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Zimag","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"1c9c60c1-06d7-491f-954c-8f285ae68d2a.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"26df56af-d282-443e-b5fe-931f1b955f21.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"19f238df-c6f0-4753-8078-54d8fa6fd965.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"09232243-2131-4241-a2e9-c79bb31c7eb6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"098c0b84-0c55-46f4-9bee-db73ad19368a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"8cd0c78e-02ae-470d-bcb9-f73b5b2bf1f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"bbb869cb-cd92-4976-a88d-47709f042415.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"2f73f07c-e07e-4f45-8eca-d73610044707.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"13f3851c-dcfb-4cf8-8478-ef804b16fe2a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"69be5366-8036-4cc4-a5a6-066f94093d7c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"4bfa539a-807e-4faf-84f8-255327a0eea4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"7add71f0-c23a-49c8-8412-6151d5f06864.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"8dcaa8c2-94d5-43c7-b195-0edf5969b0d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"d097655e-68ab-40e7-a796-5ffd60c60115.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"FileName":"1d77a994-af82-489d-9aa0-05ad8dd7de67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":91865,"AlternateName":"Dancing Plates","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"AlternateName":"Dancing Plates: Tanzende Teller","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"AlternateName":"Chinese-Juggler","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"AlternateName":"Plate Mania","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"AlternateName":"Tanzende Teller","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":91865,"AlternateName":"Dancing Plate: A Danca dos Pratos","Region":"Brazil"}]},{"DatabaseID":7946,"Name":"Dodge 'Em","ReleaseYear":"1980","Overview":"You control a race car on a four lane track, and your goal is to collect all of the dots in order to earn points and advance to the next level!

An endangered dolphin is calling you!  Only by learning the dolphin's sonic language can you guide her through schools of seahorses, battling a monstrous squid, to gain magic powers from and elusive seagull.  Hurry!  Lend an ear...\n\nYou will guide your dolphin through openings in the seahorse schools by listening to sonic tones and catching waves. Pay attention to the following:\n\nTHE SEAGULL:  \nPeriodically, a seagull will fly overhead.  You'll know he's coming when the squid changes color.  Have your dolphin leap up, touch the seagull and then quickly turn and chase the squid.  This is the best way to gain points.  Also, the game resets at the next difficulty level putting distance between your dolphin and the squid.\n\nTHE SLIP:  \nAnother great way to outsmart the squid is by giving him \"the slip\".  If the squid is right on your tail, wait until he catches a good wave.  Then, reverse your dolphin's direction and swim under him immediately.  As long as the squid's good wave remains on the screen, he won't be able to reverse and catch you.\n\nSCORING:  \nPoints are earned in a variety of ways.  Every time your dolphin touches a seagull, or a squid, you score points.  The number of points depends on the color of the squid. Scoring peaks at 800 per seagull and 8000 per squid.\n\nAlso, you'll score 100 points each time your dolphin catches a good wave or each time you run the squid into a bad wave.  And, when your dolphin swims through the seahorses, you'll score 0 to 50 points, depending on your degree of accuracy in getting her through the opening.\n\nAt 300,000 points, the word Amazing! appears on the top of the screen and the game stops.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaRaHElHohc","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Bob Whitehead","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"eb958d2b-7b45-4d4f-8131-eefdd533e978.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"d06224fa-a7ea-401f-988f-d1d5572434e4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"891644dc-f099-4e91-aace-a9b9c663e363.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"1ee7b9f1-5f8b-4c8d-815c-eaf09c5fabec.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"b25f8071-ce06-44a9-bad9-7f6e59b9fe8c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"4960f979-cd2b-4232-af5c-3a4e68247510.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"ca65bc40-b84a-446f-b4f5-bd1713e6ed7a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"8023492d-4876-4e91-ab88-a900aa62cb3f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"67bf9628-318a-42f2-83c0-133548016332.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"13cffff2-eff3-47f3-a454-7e9984ac15f3.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"49317647-f621-4331-9a92-1ff139aaf0f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"1ea240bf-20ac-406d-a14c-172e183d3ba1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"2ce50a6e-0c4d-4b66-8d3a-26b7ebe42607.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22152,"FileName":"72f0a96a-6c49-4525-9075-966c95c6edcb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22152,"AlternateName":"Vogel Flieh","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":22152,"AlternateName":"Tuby Bird","Region":"Australia"}]},{"DatabaseID":31191,"Name":"Donald Duck's Speedboat","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Donald has entered the Duckburg boat race and has taken to the sea with his speedboat.

The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular characters.\n\nThe game is divided into four different one-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final screen occurs at 100 m.\n\nReleased in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally \"Jumpman\") and Donkey Kong.\n\nDonkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzI1RBdK2_g","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Coleco","Publisher":"Nintendo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"a4e0e320-36fc-42a2-882b-16268569bf65.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"73e9ad04-0b9e-4e73-bd79-1221ff5b3002.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"569feddc-cce1-4853-ad81-de4b1f608b1d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"206e4408-764f-4a73-8b53-2968e676b64b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"6021417e-767d-43dc-8b76-4936ea1376dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"d269b4d4-e988-432a-ad42-395ce759301f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"36148a46-9f85-4572-ac3a-0d219e02b96d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"c0d9c388-4b2c-4da8-9eca-d2dec60cacdb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"0e76d0c1-7906-4d85-9637-556eae624c4d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"49be4271-95a3-4720-9bda-4fb6f3e2929c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"5a5a453c-e62d-479e-8e53-1a4b2672ea5c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"0d8cf73b-38e6-4bea-a0a7-f423b36d105d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"07fae70e-cbff-4aed-871e-f2cd8964fbfd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"eccdadf1-52e1-4d7e-a3c9-c8b69784c4c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"56f7e491-d429-417a-9df2-95b0922c34a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"4a67bdf1-1d39-49d5-81a6-f29564afbc8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":2876,"FileName":"4c274ac6-dad4-440b-9445-f1a91572b275.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7613,"Name":"Donkey Kong Junior","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa!\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's father.\n\nAlong the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.\n\nJunior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.\n\nIn the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nLike the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzveu9GEEMQ","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"67f80da0-dfce-4737-9df3-52d01cf7f1fc.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"dd29f3ca-69de-4fd1-b34a-bd9181e9577c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"e44aa755-041d-4610-839f-d8b730f54f96.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"42f53845-3ffc-4a26-b459-123a7c27388a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"28829c9e-7786-444e-81cd-9d2e30872709.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"368949d2-e154-45ab-91d1-ad1e7a895af5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"f48a492e-c74d-43ac-8e4e-9fcddf384eba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"491b9633-03ac-4dcc-8bda-57a60c724753.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"f7cf48a2-e7b3-458b-8b6a-4c32f01e257e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"ac906d84-26dc-408c-8810-28bcc42b4b52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":7613,"FileName":"222ae540-8441-49a1-b7b3-cb89c5212313.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164878,"Name":"Donkey Kong VCS","ReleaseYear":"2013","Overview":"Donkey Kong VCS is a new conversion of the original arcade game for the Atari 2600 video computer system.

One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the \"Black Warriors\", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.\n\nUsing whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.\n\nThe NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained.

Use left Joystick for the top car; right one for bottom car. Hold Joystick with button at the upper left.\n\nTo shift gears, clutch by pushing Joystick to the left and shift by letting the Joystick spring back to the center.\n\nYour car starts each race in neutral (N). There are four gear positions--1, 2, 3, 4--and you must clutch and shift between each gear. You cannot downshift.\n\nWhen the countdown reaches 0, you can start. If you drop into gear too soon, before the end of the countdown, EARLY will appear on the screen and you have to wait for the next race. You can clutch during the countdown, but you cannot drop into 1st until  the countdown reaches 0.\n\nThe object of Dragster is to beat your opponent across the screen, or to race against the clock for best time.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqsoO-UGiY8","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"7d4ea4d0-3343-4fb6-9c9a-da4e35523de3.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"0aa43776-fa2e-4c50-bfb6-bf024422a90b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"f40283c2-b80e-453b-a10c-92fccf15b6bb.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"d8764054-39e5-4433-a949-c60d5864a6dc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"e3b5d85b-e15d-43bf-a81d-132787a139ce.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"1c566fd0-6cb4-486d-b344-c58c18b05659.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"7fa4aa03-3610-41ca-941e-f8c2b35cdc5d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"d83d1f60-d5da-47c1-b0ee-0c9de01f4695.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"098ca4cd-7f2f-4cd8-a36e-b957a0d22b0e.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"8cba6622-57e5-4ec4-97cb-d74d49b54aad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"e7f07655-afac-4623-8d2e-9a687a3de006.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22154,"FileName":"3b75ffd2-1620-4d14-bdcd-ce7f6a9022db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22154,"AlternateName":"Dragster Rennen","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":171793,"Name":"Dschungle Boy","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A very obvious, but quite playable Pitfall Clone.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-2fMaAD0mg","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Quelle","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"9d216451-c185-4078-b97d-7cf427ca4ed8.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"4dfd5ad0-b1b9-4843-b77c-654b67bb74fb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"e126461e-d26c-4034-9d51-6602d51b79e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"35e5a163-9929-415b-865e-0d6c3c7557ec.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"73416250-54a0-4eb5-b5fe-4ed722e6f951.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"ac0edf6f-dd41-434e-97d5-3c11c1e66195.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171793,"FileName":"45c48c5f-564a-4c99-b3ae-1b6f8df8ef44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":171793,"AlternateName":"Jungle Boy","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":138627,"Name":"Duck Attack!","ReleaseYear":"2010","Overview":"Duck Attack! is an action-adventure video game developed for the Atari 2600 video game console.

Atari advertised Dumbo in European Atari catalogs and even had a prototype box made, so the decision to shelve it must have been made quite late.  Even though Dumbo was developed as a children's game, the gameplay is quite difficult which may be the reason why it was never released.\n\nThe object of the game is to guide Dumbo around the screen and catch or shoot balloons before they reach the top of the screen (sort of like Kaboom in reverse).  Some balloons have bombs attached to them and are deadly to the touch, so they must be shot down using peanuts from your trunk.  Every now and then you will see a balloon with a clown riding it, you must shoot these balloons and catch the falling clown before he hits the bottom.  If the clown makes it to the top of the screen he'll stay up there and begin to drop things on you.  Every time three balloons reach the top of the screen the ceiling gets slightly lower, this gives you less and less room to grab the incoming balloons.  The ceiling can be raised a bit by safely catching clowns or by winning the bonus round.\n\nScoring exactly 10,000 points (or multiples of) causes the balloons to turn into the initials PcN (for Peter C.

Eli needs to return to his spaceship. You move him up the ladder by solving addition or subtraction problems. A problem appears with four answer choices below. Move the joystick left or right to select your answer then press the button. After 20 questions, Eli reaches his ship. If you got 18 or more answers correct, Eli will jump for joy and there will be a flashing word WOW.\n\nThe child always uses the right joystick. In two player settings, the left joystick is used by the parent to advance to the next problem, start the game and count apples. In one player, you advance automatically.\n\nThe left difficulty switch is used to select one or two player. The right difficulty switch is used to select addition or subtraction. These must be selected at the main menu before you begin your game. The game select switch returns you to the main menu if you are in a game or changes the game number on the main menu. The TV Type switch switches in and out of the counting screen in a game or set the speed of the pacer (timer) on the main menu.\n\nThere are three types of games, each with up to ten difficulty levels. In game type one, called Practice, there is no time limit. The child can take as long as needed to answer the problem. In game type two, called Pacer, there will be a plus or minus sign at the bottom that moves from left to right. If it reaches the right side barrier, the problem is marked as wrong then it is on to the next problem. You can set the pacer speed from the main menu with the TY Type switch. If your difficulty level allows for counting, when you switch to the counting apples screen, the timer stops and when you return, it resets. In game type three, called Phantom, in addition to having a time limit, the only answer selection that shows is the one that the arrow is under.\n\nThis is one of the rarest Atari 2600 games and apparently saw fairly limited distribution.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxFviBhsb_I","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Simage","Publisher":"Simage","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"61b8ae09-9317-4366-a0ae-0173ede6b297.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"c295eda0-993c-4663-b3b1-43ef2015928d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"3324bfef-d258-4d17-9bfd-37b2d422962e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"dd3f3ad2-2182-4e67-ac2d-09a55f184d6d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"e01990d3-124f-4226-8f5e-9239cda672ca.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"c767944d-3b9b-43f0-8c5f-b6a895fc6624.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"84d0f1cc-80f3-46c5-a82a-1421f70dd5d9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"b6258258-3b06-47c8-971e-815982b0ceed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"8c2588cb-7330-4b0b-90c1-d6a2bdd5b485.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":31931,"FileName":"9b5590f2-bc2d-44fb-817b-3589c34949f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":96247,"Name":"Elk Attack","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Silly name aside, Elk Attack is really a Pac-Man type game but without a maze.

To help you fight the worms there are power squares scattered around the board which when grabbed will render your Yo-Yo temporarily invincible and increase your speed.

Because of this its best to just go about your business and clear the maze instead of hunting down the worms.\n\nElk Attack is a port of the obscure Taito arcade game Electric Yo-Yo!

The driving conditions will vary as the days pass by; not only will you have to drive at different times of day with different amounts of light, but the seasons can change as well. Snow, ice, and fog will occasionally appear to make driving more treacherous. With each day that passes, the other cars will become faster and more aggressive. At the bottom of the screen is an odometer, so when the race is finally over you can see how far you made it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvli9CXSqP4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Larry Miller","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1983-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"86d64169-3bf3-4086-ab29-aeb2cd969e30.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"c756abd8-3283-4314-81fd-32ff3be5897d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"3dbbaae2-8945-4ba2-9ded-b566a21bff6a.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"a3bc14ad-bcc0-4491-befa-b4a5749aa26f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"16c2a27c-1a9d-4273-bbaf-ae94a31afe5c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"09f1ef75-e52f-412a-a6de-2939a5f9ea29.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"b7609a1c-618a-4be8-aaf0-aefaf4060c3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"89ffe6c3-2988-44e1-bf5f-2a5439c3979f.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"4c3f0bce-ca23-4e22-9479-e37c5e83f9d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"1f9d80ac-43ba-49dd-8075-e8efe8a7106b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"fddb24fd-4da9-4265-a2f9-abd2bc558f2c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"dc9d396c-4e41-4f0b-a7eb-ff63bb439a0f.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"d2b98596-fe5e-4036-b399-8d598e8728d7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"505d2186-b5f6-4f41-bae4-210f1237569a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"27544e21-d608-431e-b32f-26c329149ace.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"7137c207-d0a8-4770-9c89-b3d6e3574a8e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"df4e7531-5c17-4a8a-951a-2c3020cb5468.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"d8762496-de1a-4a63-9bd0-57e73e53f8b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"31c43562-d598-4979-988c-acbfd2394148.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"4c8c0b08-55bb-4666-94e3-9b35ce2a387d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"7665ebce-da74-4a37-a4d4-767696a4b91c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"0676f2cc-8c4e-4ec5-a753-0e56338d4277.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"03318e40-3057-426d-b103-4e65ceb82139.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"cd4b1a86-530d-4150-bc7d-a63519c005af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"FileName":"e985d3fe-3bbc-4796-95a9-8b17a0b8c712.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":8357,"AlternateName":"Super-Ferrari","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"AlternateName":"Transamerika-Rennen","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":8357,"AlternateName":"Super-Ferrari","Region":"Australia"}]},{"DatabaseID":145558,"Name":"Enigma Machine","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":145558,"FileName":"7edca68c-c5d9-4be6-846b-72bd02f508ab.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145558,"FileName":"614c01c0-bd86-4cdc-bd60-5b030511702e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145558,"FileName":"cb693085-b280-4174-9aef-5f787944b7c2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145558,"FileName":"20c94e1d-2c87-4ab1-89f7-d5d067b08b10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145558,"FileName":"2557d948-9589-487e-9857-bbd362c58e61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132274,"Name":"Entity","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The Entity is an unreleased 20th Century Fox game based on a horror movie sharing the same name.

Kidnapped! Shanghaied! You find yourself in a huge maze being watched by the Mindmaster. He is testing your intelligence, reflexes, agility, etc. The honor of you and the entire human race depends on how fast you can solve the Mindmaster's puzzles and six mazes.\n\nYou begin in maze one. You must go through the maze and find colored, shaped pegs then find the correct shaped hole to put it in. As if that wasn't bad enough, there is an Alien Stalker wandering the maze and if he touches you, you lose one chance. You can tell how close he is by the beeping sound. The faster and higher it is, the closer he is. He cannot pass through walls or doors. Also, starting with maze two, there are force fields in the maze that if you touch them, you lose one chance. There are also one-way doors starting with maze four. If you go through one and turn around, there is no way back. You can never go through a door when backing up.\n\nThere are also skill tests in mazes one through five that you can complete for points. They are as follows:\nMaze 1: Agility - Move your cursor from side to side to avoid the falling bricks. The four collisions and the test is done.\nMaze 2: Reflexes - Press your joystick in the direction of the arrow.\nMaze 3: Recall - Watch the sequence of flashing arrows then move your joystick in the same sequence.\nMaze 4: Dexterity - The same as the agility test except the test is over if you get hit once.\nMaze 5: Coordination - Land a lander onto a platform without using much fuel. You get up to five attempts.\n\nYou start each maze with sixty points and every few seconds a point is deducted. The total score for each maze is the score you got on the skill test plus whatever is left of the beginning sixty when you exit the maze. If you lose all your chances or finish maze six, you will get your final score and the Mindmaster's impression of you and the human race.\n\nAtari 2600 Difficulty Switches\nThe difficulty switch on the left controls the number of chances you get.\nA=5 chances\nB=9 chances\nThe difficulty switch on the right controls the Alien Stalker's speed.\nA=Fast\nB=Slow","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sP9r9Vl-0w","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Dennis Caswell","Publisher":"Starpath Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"34566c70-1b5d-4349-8bc2-97ecd8097f65.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"afa51ecb-6c33-4b71-9cd6-250da8cd3812.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"ef1b4a71-f4e2-439f-92d1-feba48779e40.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"28ab23b0-f9f6-4a0e-b58e-a32e004c6d8a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"050a3479-19f9-4a7b-ab9f-00caacf41921.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"a7fd26f1-cb2e-42b6-a53e-9158b7e07d8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"ffd96f87-3ca6-4fcf-8a8e-b01b552fb4f7.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"afe5da9d-8b6c-4b88-848c-8078db6e5bc6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"60080530-d1ef-48fd-a44f-bc92f0ce757d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"37015c8e-180c-4351-880c-bca5b1f7672f.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"2757cb60-b571-4290-b190-9df61c45beb4.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"daaa98cb-9dc7-4f0c-919d-d26f44ca02cb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"ff906fd6-d4e4-4664-9082-89ae5dce1b41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":23918,"FileName":"a78756eb-01d1-4cc5-b0df-d26eff2ff907.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174417,"Name":"Escape It!","ReleaseYear":"2011","Overview":"Escape It! is based on the European VideoPac (Odyssey2) game \"Labyrinth.\" It is a two-player race to the exit game through a maze that is constantly changing while you navigate through the maze.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Alan W.

Enraged, the Evil Magician has reclaimed the chalice and vowed to avenge the loss of his beloved dragons. Joining the pursuit is his vile apprentice, and it’s also rumored that he has created an even more hideous creature to guard the chalice this time around.\n\nAs in your last Adventure, the object of the game is to recapture the Enchanted Chalice and return it to the Gold Castle walls. Once again, this will not be an easy quest. The Evil Magician (red wizard) and his apprentice (grey wizard) can cast spells that weaken and slow you. Their touch is deadly, but all hope is not lost. They are vulnerable to attack by the Fire Staff— swords will not help you in this Adventure. The Evil Magician will succumb to two hits from the staff and his apprentice needs only one well-placed fireball. They may not stay deceased for long however— the wizards can use their resurrection spells to revive each other.\n\nThere are four castles in your Kingdom: the Gold Castle, the White Castle, the Red Castle, and the Grey Castle. Your home castle, the Gold Castle, is already open, but the other castles need to be opened with the proper Key. Inside the castles are multiple rooms, some of which are dark and can only be explored by torchlight. The castles are separated by the familiar labyrinths, but the Evil Magician has made sure that your old pathways will just lead to dead-ends.\n\nScattered throughout the kingdom are certain items to help you in your search for the Enchanted Chalice. To pick up an item, simply touch it, but remember that you can only carry one item at a time. To open any castle, touch the castle gate while in possession of the proper key. The white castle key will open up the White Castle, the red dragon key will open up the Red Castle, and the grey skull key will open up the Grey Castle.\n\nAlong your journeys you will find various items to assist in your quest (such as various keys, the Fire Staff and Enchanted Chalice), as well as enemies who will attempt to thwart your quest (the Bat, Apprentice, Evil Magician and Chalice Guardian).

The first player to fall past a platform captures it and scores a point. Taking time to collect power-ups can give some advantage, but taking too long only results in death at the top of the screen. Watch out, because as you progress, the platforms slowly accelerate!\n\nFall Down includes both two-player and single-player modes against a highly effective computer opponent. Game modes include:\n\nHuman vs. AI\nHuman vs. AI, easy mode\nHuman vs. AI, pass-by mode\nHuman vs. AI, invisibility mode\nSingle Player\nHuman vs. Human\nHuman vs. Human, pass-by mode\nHuman vs. Human, invisibility mode\nIn pass-by mode, the players don't bounce off each other as in the default mode. In invisibility mode background alternates colors, making one of the players invisible. Easy mode makes the computer opponent fairly dumb.\nFall Down is one of the first homebrew games to support Richard Hutchinson's AtariVox. Fall Down uses the AtariVox to save your high score for each game mode, as well as for some in-game speech (\"Red Wins! New High Score!\"). When you power off your Atari 2600 and come back later to play Fall Down, your high scores will be restored!\n\nFall Down can be purchased in cartridge form from the AtariAge Store.\n\n* BLUE couldn't make it for the PAL version, but his side-kick BLUEISH GREEN was more than ready to take up the fight!","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1lHMgKnq5U","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Aaron Curtis","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138078,"FileName":"f50e6f68-19a8-4e75-a6c7-d3ae235665d6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138078,"FileName":"b0276e15-76ed-4e72-a4ec-dabaee90c8fb.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138078,"FileName":"9cecf7d2-ece1-4766-b31e-43825aae5638.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138078,"FileName":"673a7b6b-b0ec-46ad-987f-5ee136fd904c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138078,"FileName":"6263c394-9725-4e59-a666-92c315483b2f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22155,"Name":"Fantastic Voyage","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Fantastic Voyage is a vertically scrolling shooter for one player. The premise of the game follows that of the 1966 movie of the same name; you and your submarine have been miniaturized and injected into the blood stream of an ill patient. Your goal is to prevent the patient from dieing by locating deadly blood clots and destroying them. In each level you will guide the submarine through the blood vessels and need to avoid the many obstacles you'll encounter such as bacteria and clotlets. The submarine is equipped with a laser ray which can be used to shoot these obstacles. There are also helpful items as well; some phases have numerous blood cells (don't shoot these, the patient needs them!) and enzymes (shoot these to release their healing properties). When you make it past all of the obstacles and through the narrow passage ways, the blood clot can be found; once destroyed you move on to the next level. If you crash too many times or fail to destroy the clot, the patient dies and the game is over. Several game options are included which control the difficulty and length of each level.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrxxBFBCq_A","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sirius Software","Publisher":"20th Century Fox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"5bfcaace-c21d-4831-908d-7018eedb61f2.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"d3892e78-1fbc-4864-8df4-f1e27a084ec5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"398932e6-1a51-4576-ac16-023767fe0dee.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"52c2045d-a136-47a2-b1d2-a542063be832.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"5f7b526f-d9ff-4350-a8a4-a90eba8bc1f7.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"a7d69090-0b1f-41b8-9d3c-9d31514f5ea3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22155,"FileName":"434569d9-1d0a-4143-887a-2219078dcb65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":96250,"Name":"Farmyard Fun","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Farmyard Fun is a PAL conversion.

When you have located all of the trident pieces, the cage holding Neptina can be unlocked, but if you run out of energy first the game will be over.\n\nTrivia:\n\nRelease the mermaid on level two, but swim up and leave before her cage fully opens. Transform into a seagull and fly to the left or right to a volcano. The initials of each programmer (Rob Fulop, Michael Becker and Wilfredo Aguilar) will replace the volcano fireballs.\n\nThe manual mentions to watch for a 'special surprise' for completing the game. At the end of level 7, 31001 95031 LGCA appears. This is actually Imagic’s old address (P.O. Box 31001, Laguna, CA 95031).\n\nImagic held a contest in which you could win $1000 by correctly answering how many tridents are hidden in the Fathom ad (below) and on the back of a Fathom box, and having your entry card drawn.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqpOBifhhy4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Imagic","Publisher":"Imagic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"43b0f0e3-a5cf-4b62-b242-2c64faadb928.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"fa3cb18e-972c-425b-8c75-4c5e26ddab90.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"437258da-f856-4934-ad56-8fd6e203d49d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"b499daba-2213-42ef-adc0-038d8f33082a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"484ff6d1-0f47-4a9e-81cb-ba2cfcada78b.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"95ed38d1-7d8d-45a4-9795-8fa05a61cbfa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"9645d69d-2c1a-4164-966c-cd57c3d13432.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"23e485fc-4795-4ba7-8cda-f5009c9e12a7.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"23a76b9f-dead-4cc1-845e-14ede093332e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"eb8ff52b-01f7-4dfd-afa2-e105fb4435f6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"ac4c4133-bfcb-4edf-8af7-2091019a40fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"1a4b5eb3-09bd-40d8-9d9c-ff1a46c8dbdc.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"4ae9cc88-31ac-4b48-bc00-2aecf8485440.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":26201,"FileName":"c63fffd1-ff48-43bb-9e97-d279af4b6fed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":96251,"Name":"Felix Return","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcoythzOLRg","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":96251,"FileName":"6b838da2-ef12-49b9-a0c9-18fad8541de2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":30363,"Name":"Final Approach","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"You are an air traffic controller at an international airport.

Depending on which floors have caught fire, the worker will move to the lowest floor he can which isn't burning; you'll need to estimate which floor he'll be on when you position the ladder. Once the worker is safe, you move on to the next (more challenging) level. The fire in the building may spread quickly! If necessary, you can use a fire hose to put out the fire.

The goal is to destroy the bricks at the top of the screen by hitting them with the fireballs. When all the bricks are destroyed, the player moves on to the next round and is given one additional fireball to keep in play. Five different game variations are included:\n\n    Firetrap: Two additional fireballs are trapped within brick walls. Once a hole forms in the walls, the player will also need to keep these additional fireballs in play.\n\n    Marching Blocks: In this game, each time the player catches a fireball, the rows of blocks will drop down one level. From time to time, a mystery fireball may also appear.\n\n    Knock-A-Block: This is the most basic game variation. There is a solid wall of blocks at the top of the screen that the player needs to destroy.\n\n    Migrating Blocks: In this game, the rows of blocks move. Every few seconds each row of blocks will rotate either to the left or to the right.\n\n    Cascade: There are five additional fireballs trapped within the block formation. When the player destroys enough blocks to release an extra fireball, it too will need to be kept in play.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5mNd-kU-fA","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Arcadia Corporation","Publisher":"Arcadia Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"65d41e7f-25cd-461e-85ed-15d8fc1f19b0.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"a1cbfdb0-38c7-42b0-a55d-81c4fccf8b17.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"b0a779a6-6bd6-4104-9d7a-81586826c377.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"1c80984b-6f0b-4fd7-a0b4-de8d9e805d8d.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"da9f6026-6e85-4e13-be13-d25148860081.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"ad5c5463-8943-4fc0-a44b-40882018298a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"202b32cd-86c4-4dab-be07-ca51306fe20e.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"69119ee0-be2c-43c7-9fca-9eb9e1150775.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"1e122915-665e-49c8-bcb5-ecc091885a07.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"e55061ef-bc4c-4d87-8a54-10896128eea5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34325,"FileName":"48208c8f-70d6-45c5-b839-f3089d80f551.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":20286,"Name":"Fishing Derby","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Fishing Derby, your goal is to be the first of two players to catch 99 pounds of fish.

Your goal is to locate a flag hidden somewhere on a 9x7 grid. Using the joystick you can move your explorer around the grid; on any square you can press the button to see if the flag is located in that square, or if not to receive a clue as to the flags location. If the square doesn't contain the flag, one of several items may appear: an arrow indicating what direction the flag is, a number indicating how many squares away the flag is, or a bomb which will cause you to have to start again. In the one player game your goal is to locate as many flags as possible in the 75 second time limit. There are several varieties of two players games: in free-for-all, both players can move around the grid simultaneously and whomever finds the flag first scores a point. In the other two player games, players take turns moving around the grid. Several skill levels are available which control the players moving speed, allow the flag to be stationary or move, or add an invisible wall around the playfield.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"Capture\" -- Sears Tele-Games release","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiHLJo8o2zI","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"Jim Heuther","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"3736b4a4-1563-413d-b177-24a4ad23ffa5.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"1ccc9b41-9ff7-472a-a7a5-77ec1a3c04be.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"52b25dd3-7648-49f9-a9bf-ea4d18ba6c33.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"ed02f340-e564-43a0-9f35-109ea4809210.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"cf4b7ab6-979f-428e-8c8f-22c153d22d08.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"f65d9e54-cb25-4a99-9a72-e92953b95408.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"13e2a802-8c85-44c6-a1bd-f6249005df7c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"052d6455-6c38-4301-85bb-0ef26d5eccba.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"64109ab5-a209-4ec1-9197-95de681a7941.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"346b8278-9eae-4322-b295-2eddfabd5f5b.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"6df6e36a-3f18-4f6c-959b-95116abe3fe7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22158,"FileName":"7ea7bb47-76fa-4a34-badd-79a0b6f4bb9b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":22158,"AlternateName":"Flag Capture ~ Capture","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":22158,"AlternateName":"Capture","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":162378,"Name":"FlapPing","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"\"The future of gaming can be summed up in two words -- Pong and Joust.\" ...with these prophetic words on rec.games.video.classic, \"Otter\" planted the seeds for the game you see before you now. FlapPing, at its core, is an oldschool Pong Deathmatch... but with a \"Flap\" button. Each player flaps furiously to prevent the opponent from getting a ball past and scoring a point--first to 10 points win (3 points in a \"poorlords\" game).\n\nFlapPing features two primary game variations, a \"classic pong\" mode which resembles the classic Pong arcade game, and \"poorlords\", where each player must defend a wall in a manner similar to the arcade game Warlords. You can play another human, or take on all the AI might of your Atari 2600. The Pterodactyl of Joust also makes an appearance in FlapPing, adding an unpredictable element to the gameplay!\n\nFlapPing is descended from JoustPong, the name Kirk Israel originally chose for his original homebrew game. Unfortunately, this name stepped on the Pong trademark owned by Atari, and in early 2005 he renamed the game top FlapPing so it could once again be sold in the AtariAge Store, complete with a new label and manual designed by Dave Exton.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Kirk Israel","Publisher":"Atari Age","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162378,"FileName":"3fd28193-a983-463c-bbb1-280aeba74dc1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162378,"FileName":"5aac63b4-d7b9-47f9-a3d8-8568503749c5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":162378,"AlternateName":"JoustPong","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":163540,"Name":"Flappy","ReleaseYear":"2014","Overview":"Flappy is a homebrewed demake of Flappy Bird for the Atari 2600/VCS.

The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"\"Das Verruckte Huhn\"\" -- German title\n    \"Bloody Human Freeway\" -- Activision prototype title\n\nTrivia\n\nBefore Freeway became a game about a chicken crossing the road, it was originally known as Bloody Human Freeway. While the gameplay was exactly the same, players controlled a human instead of a chicken. If the cars hit the person, he would explode into a little blood splatter instead of being bounced backwards. Bloody Human Freeway can be found in playable form on the Game Boy Advance version of Activision Anthology.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGMnbhULr-4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1981-07-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"d67d799d-d9fd-439e-a174-943abd534100.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"fc699e72-8217-4881-8ba2-c692a1e8f64c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"10394594-e298-420e-b913-94ce6185a323.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"3cf6c74b-2ec3-403d-a413-a1e3d8daf1e1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"7fd6f7c9-3626-4e66-9358-5681c6b82330.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"8229f8d3-2e54-4cbd-9fd5-b281fad0a142.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"7ee7b0a5-032e-42a2-b750-a0f7cefc9e6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"10104d2a-0bd1-4a29-869b-e90fcafd7354.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"fd77f5e3-9473-4d6e-9d4b-cfd329c6ae80.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"85d7ed27-5182-4df3-a5b3-981019401398.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"983e2286-1183-4968-afc2-d27e5f98872d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"d4cf6541-9977-4465-a4ee-d35dae01fa20.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"a45c136e-d0a4-42d7-8251-3025aa03731e.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"db394eaa-cb56-48e8-a553-2d12b89785dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5304,"FileName":"6d86b29d-9398-4dbc-923f-42c544e7acdd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166888,"Name":"Frog Demo","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"This prototype was found in a box of EPROMs given to the Digital Press by Dr. John Bronstein, one of the co-founders of Commavid.

An even earlier (work-in-progress) version was shown at the Summer 1982 CES show.  Prototypes (and possibly copies) have been available for some time now.  Best Electronics had it for $12 at one time. \n\nThe game has nice, clean graphics.  The game features nice, clean graphics, with 1 or 2 frogs on a lily pad.  Each frog even has its own realistic \"ribbet\" sound.  The object is to leap and catch as many insects as you can with your frog's tongue.  Pressing the fire button shoots your frog's tongue out.  The difficulty switches affect the length of your tongue (a little longer when set to B).  There are four game variations: 1 and 3 are one-player versions; 2 and 4 are two-player versions.  You are allowed so many misses-an insect will fly away if you fail to get it after a certain time limit.  Games 3 and 4 allow more misses, but less time to get the insects.  There are five types of insects.  \n\nThe game subject and total lack of difficulty shows this game was going to be aimed at small children, much like Nick Tuner's previous game Demons to Diamonds. This and the fact that it looked almost identical to Mattel's Frogs and Flies could have been the reason it was eventually not released.\n\nThe cart, (green) box and manual are reproductions from 2004.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIPSkilaWI","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"61b2b29b-d69e-4407-a593-de5da4f1fb9c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"dd577f67-ed57-4478-adaf-24b91c65553a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"00569d70-cf22-4f2d-ad2d-7e02b4bc2a06.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"8106efed-e04d-4799-b956-b0ef4c43d9c0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"2ed5d752-9ba6-4d63-a3c4-eba4e5389c82.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"9f2b533a-eb05-44c2-a1a1-394fe748f709.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"403b0a87-bd8a-4bef-a76f-65eceb9ae2e4.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"dd6c5153-3339-4006-ba04-b8af30dfba6b.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"23760dfc-e5d4-4da8-b7ea-1364af883fcf.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"bb4fd017-a0d2-4b32-ba81-91d8a6a14829.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"da6204e7-a17a-4d4b-8c6d-35fd2f327a36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":96257,"FileName":"7d54c766-f224-454d-bb3f-4a652a9183a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1369,"Name":"Frogger","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen.

In this game, the player or players control a frog sitting on a lily pad. One frog is green and the other frog is red. The game can be played either by one or two players. The object of the game is to eat the most flies.\nEach game starts out in the morning with a light blue sky. If there is not a second player, the system will automatically take control of the red frog within a few seconds. Each frog jumps from one lily pad to the other. During each hop, a number of flies fly around the screen. The player pushes the fire button, which causes the frog's tongue to stick out. If the frog is in the right spot ahead or behind a fly, it catches and eats the fly. Each time a fly is captured it is worth two points. The game progresses throughout the day, with the sky turning a darker shade of blue, and eventually turning black as the day ends. About a minute after the sky turns black, the two frogs leave the screen – the green frog exits to the left, and the red frog to the right. A firefly then comes on to the screen carrying a \"The End\" message, which it leaves in the center of the screen. The frog who has captured the most flies at that point is the winner.\nThere are two different levels to Frogs and Flies that players can select. On the first level, the jumping off and landing points are fixed, the user needs to time their jumps to catch any flies who may come into the frog's flight path. On the second level, the frogs are free to move about the ground to catch flies as the jumping and landing points are not fixed. A player can even cause a frog to jump into the water – in that case, the frog will swim back on to the nearest pad. Generally this is to be avoided since it takes several seconds for the frog to swim back to the pad.\nA version of this game was also released for Mattel's IntelliVision system, titled Frog Bog; though it was graphically superior to Frogs and Flies, its controls were less fluent.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0rK-e21RdU","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"APh Technological Consulting","Publisher":"Mattel","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"e149ea16-4d9e-4c18-be55-70f2db47b74d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"549c0814-0fd7-45e8-974f-af14d4b534b2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"40e2fbb5-64d0-4dd9-84ac-2b1fa0db9124.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"8a1a552d-282b-4cb2-85cf-05f3f47c6c23.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"858ecbb9-13d5-43dd-a918-c78e3fc700ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"38b2ec5b-3bbc-4e2e-8751-a6501ff0fdd0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"6f57d3ca-fe0d-472b-98dd-5d6b0e918a26.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"d85e2824-bd95-4a18-95b1-6792b2d00c3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"06f72f81-84ff-48dc-9e9f-fd3a2b232519.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"60184f17-229e-4c95-894f-58da2da8b652.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"f111dc84-5fe6-4b89-a43c-f8ea0652efa3.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"c71aa3c0-a08e-4c3d-85dc-d813bd478373.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":18549,"FileName":"85a44a0a-5abb-492f-8f07-49807682de83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":18549,"AlternateName":"Grenouilles et Mouches","Region":"Canada"}]},{"DatabaseID":34908,"Name":"Front Line","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Front Line is a vertically scrolling action game.

Because of this Atari decided to stop developing games that it didn't think would sell in large numbers. Once Atari was sold to the Tramiels, they took a look at Garfield and decided they didn't want to pay the high royalties to Jim Davis and Steve Woita, so the game was canceled. When Woita heard this, he didn't take the news very well, but he had little time to protest as most of Atari's staff was laid off. To make a long story short, Garfield was never finished.

There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBC3Pvpl91k","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"6ce824ea-67f3-44e3-aecc-1167fc872657.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"40bac0ef-f056-41f6-93b0-6dc423d8c206.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"f378f90c-d0ad-4899-b659-4517065149dd.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"cec140f5-1243-46f8-814e-f333d6a0d049.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"5d91509f-fee8-46f8-b3bb-3448a5d133d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"4ede80a3-fa6e-4d14-8101-9bc6f55f193b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"d99216fc-cfc3-4dd9-8727-b1cc42f7678f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"848af63a-08a3-4e76-9335-d00b2aa24963.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"292404df-3136-41af-82c8-ab8d28ca2797.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"3ed0745e-9051-4681-ba39-1cbbd5e4556d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"5b93cff7-ae0e-4b2a-be6f-86d1fe343f8f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"c22f7aaa-07a0-4071-956d-2e06bbe1b849.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"136af45b-6121-4312-820e-c75f282f6989.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"56164093-305c-4683-8a04-34fa51280dbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1292,"FileName":"edc7a563-c36c-4809-b0e3-4db685ab8310.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17512,"Name":"Ghostbusters II","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Ghostbusters II by Activision (the makers of the original Atari VCS Ghostbusters game) never even hit a store shelf in the United States. With the video game market (circa 1989) having shifted toward more advanced systems like the NES and Sega Master System, Activision felt it would be wasting its time releasing a new VCS game. Yet it was released overseas by Salu. In scenes inspired by the movie of the same name, Ghostbusters II puts players in the shoes of the apparition-apprehending heroes as they descend into a slime-filled underground tunnel, trying to blast ghosts and collect samples of \"mood slime.\" Ghosts will attack both the player's Ghostbuster and the rope he's hanging from, and the Ghostbuster's \"courage\" meter must be monitored as well (though that can be replenished by picking up \"elixir\" power-ups in the tunnel). In the game's second level, players guide a mobile Statue of Liberty through the streets of New York City (echoing the movie's goofy climax), fending off more ghosts with her fireball-shooting torch and trying to keep a steady supply of \"mood slime\" to keep the statue moving.\n\nThe UK-produced adaptation of Ghostbusters II contains three action scenes based on the film:\n\nIn the first scene, the Ghostbusters must collect slime samples from the sewers. One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected.\n\nIn the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled.\n\nIn the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz4lZfjek9g","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Salu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"10f2c4e1-0d7d-410e-9bfc-6bc79b58360e.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"0d1ec327-7d8d-4919-adf1-715d7560d5d0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"faace118-29c4-45a0-b94a-d50fe8bd7595.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"93f5f2c2-a22b-4971-9379-3989a8444ccf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"802d35a2-6e1e-4c0d-99e0-4019ee195a80.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"bb2ae2b9-05fb-4605-93d4-98bd9b878857.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"602f5c57-5536-4ffe-b0b8-2ac07ad949e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"e326f593-8f0a-41f6-9dff-2a57829214bb.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"acfddc60-814c-465a-ad74-f4420dd833a1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"5f22b261-1568-4122-82fc-dbed963a120a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17512,"FileName":"71f92287-0247-4269-8569-db522dfb5923.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":96259,"Name":"Gigolo","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"This was a double-ended cartridge that contained Bachelor Party on one end and a new game, Gigolo, on the other.\n\nIn Gigolo, men will leave the jail and head to various houses.

In the first level you begin in a hot oven where you must escape before being cooked alive! Once you break free from the oven, you find yourself in the dining room where you need to collect all of the balloons and float up to the roof through the chimney. Now that you're on the roof you must build a bridge to a nearby tree while fighting off cats and birds that want you for a tasty treat! Once in the tree, you need to evade all the dangerous creatures in the forest (will you ever get a break?) And if you do escape the forest, you enter a cave where you must fight off your most fearsome enemy yet!\n\nOnce you defeat the boss, to your dismay you are captured again and put back in the oven too cook some more, and this time the heat has been turned up! Will you ever escape? Can you battle through 19 levels to have your chance to out-fox the final boss and win your freedom?\n\nGingerbread Man includes three game variations:\n\nSelection 1 is the default.\nSelection 2 is expert mode.\nSelection 3 is a special mode for children.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Fred Quimby","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":32983,"FileName":"762d0a00-5a10-4f7e-b941-9046f06bd80b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32983,"FileName":"4fe4931e-a7c1-40fb-88c4-3099db3b892c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34909,"Name":"Glacier Patrol","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Defend the earth from an alien mother ship with a sinister plot to cover the surface of the planet with ice.

Although the game was found a long time ago, the rom had not been dumped until quite recently so the game is still a bit of a mystery.   The only known version is very incomplete with little gameplay implemented, but rumors persist of a far more complete version in existence.  \n\nThe game only consists of one screen in which you control Charlie Brown as he flies his kite around the screen.  At the bottom of the screen there's a wind gauge which shows the speed and direction of the wind.  There's also a timer a the bottom of the screen which slowly counts up which may be part of the scoring system (based on total time instead of score).  You goal is to fly your kite as long as possible while avoiding birds, balloons, rockets, and of course the deadly Kite Eating Tree.  According to the catalog description, if Charlie Brown lost his kite he would have to earn another chance by raking leaves (what fun!).  Obviously this part of the game was not implemented yet.\n\nPushing the joystick left and right moves Charlie Brown around the screen.  Pushing up and down will let out or pull in the kite string, thus making the kite move up and down.  If the kite hits an obstacle the game will freeze for a moment and Charlie Brown will have to start again, but if the kite hits the Kite Eating Tree, Charlie Brown will actually flip over and all the balloons will turn black due to the fact that they share a color pallet with Charlie Brown and gets glitched up when he flips over.  Occasionally what appears to be lightning will flash in the background, but doesn't seem to have any adverse effects other than scaring the player (I actually jumped the first time this happened).  The lightning only appears if you move your kite into the clouds and it increases if you move into the higher layer of clouds. \n\nInterestingly it appears that by using the second joystick the player has some limited control the rom of balloons. This could be the start of an unfinished two player variation of the game (code hints at four possible variations), but it is very preliminary in this prototype.  There are no sounds or music in this version of the game, but this isn't surprising since sounds and music were usually one of the last things to finished.  The graphics appear to be top notch, but are slightly glitchy.  For example, the clouds appear to randomly disappear and reappear at various times during the game.  The row of birds also appears to suffer from this, but not to the same degree as the clouds.  This is obviously a sign that the game was still early in development.. \n\nAccording to the catalogs Good Luck Charlie Brown was supposed to be to released Summer of 83, and since this prototype is dated April of 84 we can assume development was taking longer than expected.  By 1984 Atari had canceled the Children's series so Good Luck Charlie Brown would have been canceled with it.  It's a shame though, because what was finished looks rather interesting.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yn8jHZmtVlU","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167253,"FileName":"038a7e04-1fc6-449a-a65b-1a5b9d6dd349.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167253,"FileName":"2a56a127-ab34-46c9-a621-c357a8c512ca.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167253,"FileName":"b916c616-b245-4b4e-a0f8-a24b7792c39a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167253,"FileName":"a9b30b01-cb1f-4ec5-b6e7-14d57ec51957.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167253,"FileName":"13fd42d1-0b4d-434f-9945-536b917ff6bb.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167253,"FileName":"ac2d7eaa-8954-47ad-b2bb-0861e437e534.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28690,"Name":"Gopher","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"A pesky gopher is after your carrot patch!

One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.\n\nThe fifth and final level is called Flag Ship.

It was designed and programmed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console, and published by Activision in 1982.\n\nGrand Prix was the first Atari 2600 game to feature shaded objects in color. When David Crane developed an Atari 2600 programming technique for painting large, multicolored sprites on the screen, he made a color pattern that reminded him of Grand Prix racing stripes. This inspired him to design a Grand Prix racing game to apply his new technique.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80ofIdivIDY","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"3d5fe239-6e0a-4e5b-94a5-0bc25cf7719c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"7a040397-c7e7-4fc0-926f-622e96d73483.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"cdf94976-00c9-4f79-b418-fa0a450fa5d4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"2856424d-4f39-4669-8c51-6ff99e6d4e7c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"2d4b2e82-a0a4-4e96-ab60-845be5da2c03.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"9120035b-03ec-4c7a-9686-19317b5a3613.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"877e4ca2-b265-486e-9450-08e883ce02ed.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"a7cfbcb2-c6ec-4f36-9ba4-d01b8765a1e0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"4182ff3c-94d8-4b3e-a2e0-cc846ff00dcf.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"a31f0858-d414-4b86-8f63-69a8e2f99dcf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"c506a853-2d0c-4566-8873-e7c5cd23302f.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"63821e13-b6a6-44d4-807b-7dbcbb89fe28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":21544,"FileName":"0f0b915c-8eeb-4072-a96b-c9606d18e460.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":21544,"AlternateName":"Autorennen","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":174422,"Name":"Grandma's Revenge","ReleaseYear":"2007","Overview":"You've probably heard about the incident where Grandma had a run-in with a reindeer many a Christmas ago.

The scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games is arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving through space.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNd9WQVtkzM","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Parker Brothers","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"b73b1ad9-0d67-4d44-80d9-fb9e34ebbe5f.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"b3700c02-0c7e-470e-a34c-a2fa8a944021.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"2182b512-b874-4490-97c9-8410a4f08cf3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"558506b5-ab4b-4e22-ad56-6dfbb70ea4dd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"d170d755-d973-43d9-99d4-2b0fc65ccc4a.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"fdafe9dc-e7b3-484f-8cfd-522f735fb8c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"63799981-5fe4-425d-9116-1a3dc1863aab.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"4e93cae2-cf55-4b10-b9df-8ab6b50cd964.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"8acc9ec1-d59f-45ea-acc1-5239562ffc8d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"3a142f2f-1202-4893-b257-6e48392930d7.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"0acf4d18-fe61-451b-8c90-53818dc1e11d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28595,"FileName":"57824dd4-9137-4ea8-927b-9f85f5a48ae7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10128,"Name":"H.E.R.O.","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"There is trouble in the mines! Volcanic activity has trapped numerous miners, and it is your job to save them. As Roderick Hero, you need to make your way through the dangerous mineshaft avoiding the dangerous creatures and lava, and find out where the miners are located before you run out of energy. To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!) If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"H.E.R.O.: Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation\" -- Tag-lined title\n    \"HERO\" -- Common spelling\n    \"Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation\" -- Unabbreviated title\n    \"ヒーロー\" -- Japanese title","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cx_nB1-wgfo","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"John Van Ryzin","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"13e8c409-6d2a-4888-89a0-72412e603563.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"cfcbbf65-1c61-4452-98bb-1207a697a736.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"c5ec2f53-7e74-4030-b0c0-9b07999cb37d.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"c796ee98-d866-4806-9905-de5637c385da.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"564ebc80-9bc6-4735-828a-f63bb57b25b5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"0eb429bf-b2f6-44cb-a18d-c5d24ebd7240.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"355b438c-ac8c-42d8-a1b3-f61199380701.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"2e9ad468-8fd0-4191-8032-57a39b63780c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"0eb5109b-2d85-4660-a94d-da548b7c6220.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"43b965fd-4708-417c-84e1-9f2da03510d3.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"8eb432e4-bad4-42c3-b500-5b1de2080d20.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"c25e35d2-db5b-4624-8177-8b4c25fc8740.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"58f5b666-fb39-466b-96af-3a970bfccad9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"fec14443-2f2f-413a-8ec9-908dce2117f8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"4f44d06b-2206-4454-a455-24caa96a5150.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"4e332084-65cc-4e6f-ac62-aefd0937d226.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"235eeed2-811c-4656-a6c4-b7c53cffe8f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":10128,"FileName":"ef51da38-6ebd-40a2-9cc2-15de6179774a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22160,"Name":"Halloween","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Protect the children and fight for your life \"the night HE came home!\"\n\nBabysitting a group of children in a large two-story house, players assume the role of Laurie Strode as psychopath Michael Myers has escaped from the mental institution and has come back for revenge.

For many years we did not know the name of this game since the label that once existed had long since fallen off. However in 2017 another copy of this game appeared on Ebay UK complete with a label. We now know that the game is called Hard Head.\n\nHard Head plays somewhat like Atari's Save Mary.  However this time instead of building a tower by dropping bricks from the top of the screen, you must bump blocks from the bottom of the screen.  Before you start screaming about Activision copying Atari's idea, keep in mind that this game was programmed about seven years before Save Mary.  I'm sure the similarity of the concepts is just a coincidence.\n\nIn Hard Head you control a little Space Invader guy who must use the blocks at the bottom of the screen to build a tower and escape.  As the blocks come rolling down the conveyor belt, you must jump up and bump them so they land somewhere on the screen (the blocks don't count if they go off the edge of the screen).  The movement scheme in this prototype is a bit unusual as the longer you hold the joystick in a direction, the faster your little guy will run.  Although this is very realistic, it is a bit odd for a 2600 game and may take some time to get used to.  Once you have constructed a nice little tower, you must carefully jump on the conveyor belt and them climb the tower.  Be extra careful on the conveyor belt, as touching the blocks will cause your little guy to be flattened.  \n\nStarting on the second level, you'll undoubtedly notice that some blocks will flash yellow or blue.  These colored blocks are actually part of an elaborate timing/bonus system.  The yellow block (which I call the Bump block) moves up the tower at the rate of once block a second, while the blue block (which I call the Bonus block) moves up the tower one block every time the yellow block reaches the top of the screen.  If your character happen to be on the tower when the yellow block touches him, you will be knocked down one level (slowing your decent up the tower).  However if your character touches the blue 'Bonus' block, you will gain bonus points as long as he remains on the block.  However greed can be a dangerous thing as the tower will collapse after a certain amount of time (determined by the difficulty level).  When the warning alarm sounds, you have exactly 10 seconds to hightail it up the tower or you'll be crushed under the debris.\n\nStarting on the third level, strange aliens creatures will begin to fly around the screen.  You can destroy them by hitting them with a flying block.  Smashing aliens is worth 180 points, while simply bumping a block will net you 5 points.  If you let the octopus alien reach the bottom of the screen he'll start breeding and clog the area.  However since you can simply knock the extra aliens out of the way so he's not a really big problem.  If you're really tricky you can use the blocks to fence in the alien and keep him form reaching the bottom, but this is more trouble than it's worth.  Starting on the fourth level a squat looking alien with two legs will rapidly move down the screen and try to catch your guy at the bottom of the screen.  When this happens you'll need to jump on the conveyer belt temporarily to escape until he disappears.  Unfortunately this alien is immune to the blocks so all you can do is avoid him.  If you manage to score 100,000 points the score counter will reset to zero and you will be rewarded with an extra life.\n\nUnlike most Activision games, Hard Head has no game variations. However since this is still a WIP, game variations may have been planned later on. The left difficulty switch controls the game difficulty (A=Easy, B=Hard), while the right switch appears to control how your character climbs the blocks. When the right difficulty switch is in the 'B' position you cannot touch the center of the tower, as doing so will result in a block smashing your character. Instead you must build the tower in a staircase-like fashion and climb up the edges of the blocks. Naturally this is much more difficult to set up than a simple tower of blocks, so this variation is recommended for experts only. When the right switch is in the 'A' position, your character can climb up the center of the blocks making things much easier. Although this prototype appears to be nearly complete, there are still a few bugs in the game. Glitches include such things as your character getting stuck in the walls, and the screen becoming unstable when being bumped by the yellow block or when avoiding the leg alien.\n\nThe graphics and sounds for this title are top notch; it's obvious that a lot of work went into this game. Everything from the smooth animation of your character to the cute \"Can-Can\" sequence at the start of the game screams quality. So why was this game never released? Unfortunately no one but the programmer knows the answer to this, but one possibility is that they may have left Activision before the game was completed. However since the real name of this game has now been discovered, we may yet be able to find the programmer and discover the history behind this interesting game.\n\nSpecial thanks to Mitch and bjk7382 for figuring out how to play the game in the 'A' position.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166893,"FileName":"ee167f4c-e3d6-4abb-b3b2-79669bacd906.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166893,"FileName":"79cfd233-06d6-479b-aeb5-91a74b6ed4ce.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166893,"FileName":"4de171d3-177e-440a-b509-27e58ae4211f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166893,"FileName":"f301353b-3109-42e1-b2be-440bf62ac7be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166893,"FileName":"c3dc45b6-27d8-4a65-b2d6-b8810c06bee6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132385,"Name":"Harem","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"At the start, there's sniper machine gun fire from the bushes.

The game is played from an overhead point of view where you see only your eyeballs as you explore the four floors of the maze-like mansion. To make your mission even more difficult, there are various creatures wandering throughout. Tarantulas, giant vampire bats, and one fast moving ghost will all cause you to lose a life if encountered too closely. As a defense against the creatures, a magical scepter can be found in the mansion which will make you immune to its inhabitants.\n\nThe mansion contains many doors, some of which may be locked; to explore all the rooms, you will first need to find the master key which is hidden somewhere. The mansion is very dark, and you will not be able to see any of the objects in it (and in more difficult game variations, you can't see the walls either). To reveal objects and the mansion walls, you need to light one of your unlimited supply of matches which will light up a small area around you. Don't be surprised if a swift wind or passing creature blow out your match, though!\n\nYou are only allowed to carry one object at a time so you will need to create a strategy for exploring the mansion; to unlock a door or move a piece of the urn, you will need to put down the scepter. You win the game when all three pieces of the urn are assembled and you make it out of the mansion. The game keeps track of how many matches you have used on your mission, and the fewer matches the better the score.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\n    \"Nightmare Manor\" -- Original title\n    \"Casa Mal-Assombrada\" -- Brazilian title","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIt2g9lZ_c0","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"53ee865d-5ec8-406a-ae2f-65f3b30ac066.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"75572cfe-a137-4d81-851b-240a759ef5bc.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"9a146bfc-2ed1-4107-990e-b584b6fa19c4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"c37d4653-c700-4ad0-970f-44dec327b02d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"a9375b13-f096-4cf5-a2a0-8e79f1827b6e.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"2bf7b69f-66c0-4347-b83d-527ee959e8cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"c7bc4779-bf3b-411a-a75a-74aa310be884.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"eceddfcd-ae43-4c8f-a162-917a663d385c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"3dfcc3ef-c314-483f-b2c9-4ab2ab4ed5c5.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"8682a8ec-7563-4daa-9dc4-e9ce1912bf21.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"211e5e8e-5dc0-4a7f-a6f8-8d3b24d23ad8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"f51ab3b1-1d68-43f9-8386-53483a31dda4.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"9627954e-35fb-488b-b666-cefd12f9574c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1370,"FileName":"89651fef-dba1-41a4-b529-84c09dd521d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133260,"Name":"Heart Like a Wheel","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Programmer Jim Collas confirmed that this game was called Heart Like a Wheel and was based on the 1983 movie of the same name. 20th Century Fox had contracted a company called Micro Computer Technologies to create a game to tie in with the movie.

When a mole pops out of his hole, press the corresponding button on the Kid's Controller to whack it. The faster you hit him, the more points you'll get. If the King Mole pops up, whack him for even higher points. Beware of the acorn. If it pops up, don't whack it as it will cost you points. You must score at least three hundred points by the time the mole count reaches zero. If you reach or exceed three hundred points in one round, any points beyond three hundred will be added to your score as a bonus. If you fail to score three hundred points in one round, the game is over.\n\nHoley Moley is an unreleased prototype written by Bob Polaro. The game was originally programmed back in 1983, but was never commercially released due to ownership changes at Atari. This game requires the use of the Kid's Controller, although the keyboard and touch pad controllers work fine with it also.\nA version of Holey Moley complete with a cartridge, manual, box and Kid's Controller overlay was sold at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo. You can purchase a copy of Holey Moley by visiting Atari2600.com.\n\nHoley Moley is a port of a rare 1982 arcade game by Tai. According to Bob Polaro, the game was shelved due to the change in management at Atari. Whatever the reason for its cancellation, Holey Moley appears to be complete and fully playable.\n\nThe cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2002 with permission of programmer Bob Polaro.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqvCfL67prY","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Atari, Inc.","Publisher":"Atari2600.com","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"cc5e3167-ed91-4716-80ac-79d7846f6e7c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"728b0439-8d3f-4872-9d15-314c51178366.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"5c49dcc7-3933-4869-bb27-4216b1e97ff7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"a2bbe3af-3b92-4283-b58a-20b506919f1d.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"893d539b-87eb-4517-befe-0f3932bc4524.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"5b7504ad-3220-4433-b661-8fcc43b8f8f8.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"aee586c1-03b7-4fdf-81e8-a52847138fad.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"aa03b5d3-8d10-4224-ade9-d8431e42cdbb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"704464d7-1b65-4ff8-b068-d34d21fbf950.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"9bb28c93-0aca-4bb4-ac13-19e557c1a16b.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"cacbf49b-0860-477e-b668-33d3abcd319c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34915,"FileName":"9907fa2f-876b-4d64-97b6-baa9966af422.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":9236,"Name":"Home Run","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The game can be played against the computer or with another player. You have the option to have 1, 2 or 3 players in the field. As a pitcher, you use the joystick to throw the ball and to control its speed and curve. After the ball is hit, your control all your men (they all move together since they follow the orders of a single joystick) in the field to catch the ball. As a batter, you can control the position of the baseball bat with the joystick. If you consider that your runners would make it to the next base, you can press the controller button so they stop at their current base.\n\nThe rest of the rules are basically like real baseball. Each team has nine innings in a game. You are out after three strikes, your get to first base after four balls (balls that do not fly over Home) or if the pitcher hits you with a ball. In the field, you can put out a batter by catching his ball, then another runner by reaching his next base before him or simply by touching him between bases, thus completing a double play. The only way to accomplish a home run is by hitting the ball over second base without having it caught by the field players. You score a point for each runner that reaches Home base after each of the first three.\n\nAlternate Titles\n\nHome Run [Atari [USA]]\nBase Ball [Future]\nBaseball [Taiwan - Cooper Black]\nHomerun [Unknown]\nBaseball [Sears]\nBaseball [EDU Games]\nHome Run [EDU Games]\nHomerun [Polyvox]\nHome Run [Digivision]\nHomerun [Atari Cartucho Original]\nBaseball [Splice]","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5bKhQuzysM","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Bob Whitehead","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"360c54e2-cbde-400b-8281-0547d7b5552c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"55d4b4a6-bdd8-4557-9711-ffa491733d1f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"2d8a5a9b-d47d-4b78-a543-b0fc4f4d7c13.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"f3576620-1a64-4651-bb79-e221f94380f5.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"1d9288e6-5564-42b3-a77c-6603161e41c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"e594e44c-316b-490b-b5db-d9c83240ad66.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"ed05254d-f839-4d19-b182-bf3f8b24515f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"fc630cde-b43b-4adc-9dfd-e0203a99aacf.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"15e2f095-c51f-480d-b5aa-d40ffec6dbf4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"fd678921-aa7e-4981-a79c-4c6eeeb90270.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"781ee417-9660-49ec-96d3-19826c0aebfd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"8fe6261b-b8ab-4d4e-9135-9cb1da401322.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":9236,"FileName":"d28d387a-11fe-4f4c-a121-a206bba716ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":9236,"AlternateName":"Home Run: Baseball","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":7948,"Name":"Human Cannonball","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Human Cannonball your goal is to fire a man out of a cannon and have him land in a bucket of water.

Several game options include a 16 or 30 square game grid, the ability to handicap one of the players, and the ability to enable or disable wild cards.\nThe game was also released under the name \"A Game Of Concentration\" or simply \"Concentration\".\n\nOther versions with a different title:\n\nA Game of Concentration [Atari [USA]]\nHunt & Score [Atari [USA]]\nMemory Match [Sears]","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ToAuXmT8pU","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"0402f391-fc8a-499d-9b52-2362d4796a90.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"74a7d731-3c30-49ab-839c-330d90474c44.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"761df25e-1833-4d46-9e91-ea2985628d3b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"a7970c86-9f35-4bc3-a7bc-45224746f626.jpg","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"df7a8578-09f5-411b-8b8f-c42813e69acc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"5f60842b-9933-4cf8-8e59-67041331255f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"c2b1b4a2-c189-45c5-9977-da4bfa74fab7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"7bca6d27-db31-47ca-8032-68b30d571a9d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"8abb76af-be62-40ba-9e1c-b8f5ca585b6b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"b86400de-c6fd-41aa-9b55-9a39aeef3210.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"95a29a23-1448-49a0-82da-47d68af6849f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"053ccaec-b9a4-48d1-9da1-e191e617df28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17514,"FileName":"88ea864a-d675-479c-a58a-f85d7cac2688.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":17514,"AlternateName":"Hunt & Score: Memory Match","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":17514,"AlternateName":"Memory Match","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":172878,"Name":"I Project","ReleaseYear":"2008","Overview":"Congratulations!

Unfortunately all your ammunition is depleted and so you have to avoid colliding with objects just by your flying skills! Good luck, pilots! \n\nYour helicopter is able to fly at three levels of height. The dangerous objects in your way are fences, bars, homing missiles and columns. You either have to fly aside the columns, above the fences or above or below the bars. The missile can only be disarmed by the frequency scanner and your fire button.\n\nThere is no direct score in I Project, but your progress can be judged by the entered zone and remaining distance.

He's just had a bad dream and wants a hug from his mommy. Help Teddy climb the mountain to reach his mommy.\n\nIn I Want My Mommy, the player must guide little Teddy up two mountains. The first has an apple on top and the second has his mommy waiting to give him a hug. To progress up the mountain the player must stand on a raised block and press the button to raise a magical stardust ladder which can be climbed to reach a higher level. If needed, the player can also climb down. To reach the top level, the player must have all ladders raised or they will be blocked.\n\nOn levels two through five, there is a dream demon waiting to knock Teddy down the mountain. Teddy cannot jump, however; all the player can do is avoid the dream demons or catch mommy's special kiss as it floats along. This will allow the player to knock out one demon. The kiss eventually wears off, however. If the player is knocked off the mountain, they start back at the bottom of the first screen, with the apple at the top.\n\nThe score counter starts at zero and counts up. The faster the player gets Teddy to mommy, the lower your score. The goal is to have as low a score as possible.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\n\n Sesam öffne dich!

The first player to crash into the target earns a point, and then a new target will appear elsewhere on the track.\n\n\nOther Versions:\n\nIndy 500 [Atari [USA]]\nRace [Sears]\nIndianapolis [EDU Games]\nIndianapolis [Atari Eletrônica Ltda. / (Cartucho Programa)]","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9IpQQg2mM","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1977-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"df19006c-3cec-4f55-b891-741904b87531.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"2821fe48-765b-489c-a01f-c14d92317dc3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"eaa9fbbd-1ede-4c74-8ef1-5bb878faa7d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"6f731ea4-c70a-4d2b-a99a-feef63873a03.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"7d6da4bf-4a70-4aa2-8bea-3da15df64e7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"fe1bd160-f236-40ff-bba1-cad4014e27a2.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"b5435fc2-a9ce-4e29-af6e-53178456066d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"4eb26f6b-4bf1-4152-984e-c9ff2ea1515f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"0d1f3154-6588-4261-b0ee-86821e63f12f.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"06f485e5-270f-4fdd-9103-61449e3b866e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"d4241bdd-7a83-4939-a2b4-f612d79cf7a8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"a3a1777a-50a4-4bcf-bb47-fd8f5fdd4665.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"88f893c0-9487-4306-8c66-edbf0b1e12d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":1349,"FileName":"7d5dc67f-2897-45a4-a20a-9769e13e2ec7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":1349,"AlternateName":"Indy 500: Race","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1349,"AlternateName":"Race","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":22163,"Name":"Infiltrate","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"You are a secret agent sent on an important mission to recover enemy documents.

In fact, there were actually three games planned for the 'Terra I Trilogy', although only the first two were released. The first game, called Rescue Terra I, had you traveling through an onslaught of aliens and asteroids to reach the planet of Terra I. The second game, called Innerspace, has you travel through planetary tunnels to destroy the computer system and return control to the Terra I colonists. The third and final game of the Trilogy, called Solar Defense, had you defending solar reactors around the earth while the Terra I colonists supplied them with Zenbar crystals. Having all three games linked together with a storyline (as thin as it was) was a novel idea at the time, but sadly it was not to be. While VentureVision was able to release their first game, they went under before the second or third could be released. Imagic picked up Innerspace and released it as Laser Gates, but Solar Defense remained unreleased.\n\nYou have reached Terra I and must now fight your way to a centralized computer system located at the planet's core. The objective of the game is to destroy the computer system and return control of the planet to the colonists. Your task will involve a great deal of skill and an element of luck.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Dan Oliver","Publisher":"Venture Vision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172879,"FileName":"0cd9adf1-4e0d-4956-b133-2a4e77def9dd.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172879,"FileName":"0eb56854-0876-4609-b749-6e71de3ea8ce.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":9246,"Name":"International Soccer","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"NASL Soccer is an action soccer game for two players.

Your goal in Ixion is to grab the five white squares scattered across the screen and spell the word Ixion before your time runs out. At the start of each level only certain squares are visible, and to get around more easily you must first reveal the missing squares. To reveal the missing squares, the player must move a brown sphere over an empty square. This sphere is normally stationary, but it can be moved by shooting or ramming into it. This sends the sphere bouncing around the screen, revealing squares and destroying enemies in its travels. After a short time of bouncing around the sphere will stop, requiring the player to move it again to reveal more squares. Learning how to move the sphere where you want is the key to mastering Ixion. Also moving around the game grid are enemy drones, which will attempt to destroy your ship. Unfortunately, their shots destroy tiles, making your path much more difficult to traverse. Enemy drones only take one shot to defeat, but will take out the tile they are on when they explode.\n\nIt is unknown why Ixion was never released by SEGA, but it was around this time that SEGA Enterprises (the American arm of SEGA) was sold to Bally. After this sale, all of SEGA's 2600 titles were Bally/Midway arcade games (Tapper, Spy Hunter, and Up 'n Down). It may have been felt that only well known arcade game would sell well enough in the overly competitive 2600 market, or perhaps Ixion simply got lost in the transition shuffle.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP5TVqYM2ac","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Jeff Lorenz","Publisher":"Sega","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"6a89569f-403a-4cb1-a3da-87c1cd0b76ea.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"45a5fc10-2eab-4570-852d-93179eb404ec.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"74f4d12b-ac57-4237-80ac-69ca631c6982.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"e2bf4623-f560-4c83-b6ac-ec1ca46d9bb6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"c0007eb6-65ad-4941-8cf0-147f6ca1432c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"3496216a-cf4e-4564-bf9c-3eb2252fe5ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132398,"FileName":"6fefc449-961d-4f5f-8b97-c2bad804af6b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34916,"Name":"James Bond 007","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"James Bond 007 is a 1983 side-scrolling video game developed and published by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit computers, Commodore 64, ColecoVision and distributed in Japan by Tsukuda Original for the Sega SG-1000.

After each concert, your goal is to guide the five band members to the escape vehicle so they can get to the next concert on time. You start with $50,000 from the concert and need to guide one band member at a time; the screen scrolls vertically, and you need to get past the crowds and various obstacles before time runs out. Trying to slow you down are numerous fans, reporters, promoters, and photographers. Running into each of these will cause you to lose some of the money you start with, and also precious time! Stage barriers and fences will also cause you to lose time, but you won't lose any money if you hit one of these. To help you out, roadies and your manager are also in the crowds.

As the game advances, there will be bigger and bigger crowds to avoid, and they will be more aggressive about getting in your way!","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5DYiCZCz1Y","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Data Age","Publisher":"Data Age","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"f3fedef9-ab6a-4520-83d6-706087afded3.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"b84a24ff-2d6e-4ea0-ab6b-7053c09794e2.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"0a47e9d0-3555-4a9d-8296-cef7ca6fef97.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"16c6eca0-83df-43a7-8f1a-72fa1cb00611.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"d680eabc-b4ec-4f19-9484-5d6266aaba22.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"0b8ce605-55e5-464a-82bc-a3b1763e4fc1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"0dfab289-a41a-4baf-9e59-f8d54cda0317.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"d3a42048-316e-40c4-8a4d-d82b9ff698e3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"bf212531-a6ed-4a8f-af93-db4a6bb2a967.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"957b3d4c-9582-41a0-b2f1-2e8e4369a890.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"0cdbac4e-21da-4ee6-96c0-c3820c450c2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"c0907dde-ce8d-440a-a92e-bbd0262445cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"6faf86fa-3b57-4826-a6c8-1770a29d996e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"bfb1607f-ff3c-4d2d-8dce-e016adc5529f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":7950,"FileName":"e7340452-208b-4e38-bd71-fdf26a00c0e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":7950,"AlternateName":"Rock 'n' Roll Escape","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":1350,"Name":"Joust","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.\n\nPlayers must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider.

To help you gang up on the enemy you are given command of an army of Buvskies.  Your Buvskies troops appear in each of the squares immediately surrounding your character.  When first summoned your Buvskies are only babies who must first conquer an enemy Kabobber to be promoted to full strength.  Baby Buvskies can only conquer the green Guvskies and are crushed by all other enemies, so you must protect them until they reach full strength.  You are given a limited number of baby Buvskies (displayed at the bottom of the screen), although you can gain extra Buvskies by conquering enemy troops (you are limited to nine reserve Buvskies).  Your army moves with you in a square formation, so the more troops you have on the screen the bigger the target you are.  However the more troops you have the more enemies you can crush, and you'll have a less chance of being totally annihilated by a rampaging enemy mob.\n\nKabobber was never advertised or mentioned in any Activision catalog. No instruction manual was ever made for it and the game was never released. Only one prototype is known to exist, assumably from programmer Rex Bradford himself. According to Bradford: 'What happened was that I \"finished\" the game in the standard 4K cartridge size, then Activision said they liked the game and would like me to expand it to an 8K cartridge and keep working on it. I had basically run out of ideas for the game at that point, and resisted.

However after the programmer gave the rom image to Atari Age to be distributed to the gaming community, the game proved to be very much real.  There was no mention of Kamikaze Saucers on any game list, but Syncro did take out full page ads for the game so they must have been close to releasing it.  All these things make this prototype all the more interesting, and makes one wonder what other games Syncro may have had in the works.\n\nKamikaze Saucers is your average shooter along the lines of Atlantis or Demon Attack.  You must shoot down the saucers that buzz across the screen using your oversized phallic looking ship.  If if fail to shoot the saucers down in a timely manner they will go Kamikaze on you big time!

Once you reach the top floor, the game starts again but faster.\n\nOther versions with the same title:\n\n- Atarimania\n- Beagle Brothers\n- Concorde\n- Cosmovision\n- Digitel\t\n- Digivision\n- Edu Games / Edu Juegos\n- Genus\n- JVP\n- SpaceVision\t\n- SuperVision\n- Taiwan - Cooper Black\n- Tigervision\n- Video Game (NZ)\n\nOther versions with a different title:\n\n- Hero & Beauty.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX6vvr7iplY","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Karl T.

From the airline luggage simulator Lost Luggage to the egg throwing antics of Wabbit, Apollo was never afraid to release something different.  Therefore it's no surprise that when a new unknown Apollo prototype surfaced, it featured some interesting gameplay.  However Kyphus may be the strangest game from Apollo yet...\n\nLooking a little like a cross between Racquetball and Space Cavern, Kyphus is an odd game in which the player must maneuver a dumpy looking guy through a pseudo-3D maze of rooms avoiding what appears to be a glowing cloud that shoots lasers, while being followed by a multi-colored robot that just might be a monkey in disguise.  Like I said, this game is weird!.\n\nUnfortunately, this prototype is very incomplete.  There appears to be no collision detection, few sounds, and almost no gameplay.  The only thing one can really do in this prototype is to move run from room to room, although with no collision detection implemented there is no threat from the robot or cloud.  Each room of the maze appears to have a different color, and has three to four exits (two on the sides and one at the top and bottom).  The maze is made up of 64 rooms, but doesn't appear to have a set pattern.\n\nAs you move through maze, you may notice the score and life counters start displaying odd letters and numbers.  These number and letters are actually variable values in hex decimal notation.  The programmer used these numbers to help determine the values of various game variables while developing the game.  The counters at the top of the screen display the players position coordinates, the left two digits in the score are a timer of some sort that is continually counting down, while the right two digits appear to be the room number.  It is unusual to see these in game unless it is very early in the development cycle.\n\nAlthough the prototype isn't very playable, by taking a look in the game itself we can puzzle out some planned gameplay.  Hidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy, and Invoke.  It is thought that these are commands the player would give the robot to make it do certain things.  Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot.  It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it (without hacking the code) in the current prototype.\n\nAlthough Kyphus is unplayble in its current state, it shows quite a bit of promise.  Getting the 2600 to display anything that looks remotely like 3D is an amazing feat.  It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear.  Hopefully a more complete version of the game will turn up someday, but for now we can be happy in that another lost prototype has finally been found.\n\nOnly one prototype of Kyphus is known to exist. It is thought that in the final version of the game the player would have a weapon of some type to shoot at the cloud and robot, but the object of the game is still unclear. A picture of the box was shown in a few Apollo advertisements. It appears to show a wizard battling evil clouds in a temple which is fairly close to the gameplay in the current prototype.\n\nHidden in the code are three words: Protect, Destroy and Invoke.

Also hidden in the game code are graphics for what appears to be a large monkey that would have replaced the robot. It is currently unknown how the monkey would be used in the game, and there is no way to trigger it in the current prototype.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/tLsaXiOYJC8?t=4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tim Martin","Publisher":"Apollo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":143147,"FileName":"f21218ef-f8bd-4efe-a713-4f550131d436.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143147,"FileName":"4fe048d6-768b-4a4b-ba5b-99e286804f79.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143147,"FileName":"89f3f157-24f6-4f96-9a87-6966997fb6ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":143147,"FileName":"880bd372-03fa-43e6-8d8d-83efc97fa88d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":143147,"FileName":"015a3fc8-7481-4783-ad28-2c01264f505c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174436,"Name":"L.E.M.","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In the 1960s the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. This goal was first accomplished during the Apollo 11 mission on July 20, 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit.\n\nThe L.E.M. (Lunar Excursion Module) was the lander portion of the Apollo spacecraft and was built by Grumman. Along with the Command Module, the L.E.M. was launched into space atop a Saturn V rocket. In space, the two craft docked and traveled to the Moon. Once in orbit of the Moon, the craft separated and the L.E.M. ferried two astronauts to the Moon’s surface. When the astronauts completed their mission on the Moon, the craft separated from its landing struts and returned to space to connect with the Command Module for the trip back to Earth.\n\nThe L.E.M. was a well built craft that never failed in any mission assigned to it.

The player controls a fleet of flying saucers, operating one at a time. On the planet surface below are a group of three mobile laser bases, guarded by an invisible force field that prevents the player's saucer from getting too close to the surface. Both the player and the enemy bases are armed with laser blasters, which may fire a single continuous beam at a time. The player must destroy all three bases before they are able to target the saucer and fire their own laser blasts in defense. If the player's saucer is hit, it will lose altitude and crash to the ground; however, the player may direct this fall, potentially into one of the bases, destroying it as well. Each succeeding wave of enemy bases moves faster and targets the player's saucers more quickly, while the force field becomes stronger and decreases the amount of space in which the saucer can move.\nPlayers score points for each base destroyed, with points multiplying each wave up to a maximum of 90 points per base. Players earn extra flying saucers with each 1000 points scored and may keep a maximum of six extra saucers in reserve.\nPlayers who scored 100,000 points or more could submit photographic proof to Activision and be admitted to the Activision Federation of Laser Blasters.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nLaser Blast - Duell im Weltall.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnC8xxTkUlQ","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"a7dd2a6d-5de9-475e-a6fa-921def1934a0.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"febaad15-355c-4f65-8e95-b0cc9515327e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"12e9ea19-ab9c-4c57-ab76-297e38b7c4b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"5a1e4f13-7097-403e-9b64-64312ca0d1a3.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"b2fe7aae-55c4-4f74-ada2-2705c45380eb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"524acb75-0d57-4ecc-8cd9-680fd021f468.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"67b69832-c917-41a3-ba0f-81c8ac375c1c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"c840f441-684e-45e1-a9ae-f9a9fc9b7746.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"5921c6f8-70c9-4539-8f96-75386605e4d9.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"0a1103f2-800f-4bfc-85e5-f5122f8a9e83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19892,"FileName":"bebd9fcc-b09e-4a80-b642-e8f072e7ad07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":19892,"AlternateName":"Laser Blast - Duell im Weltall","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":22207,"Name":"Laser Gates","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Laser Gates is a side scrolling shooter. Failsafe detonators inside the cryptic computer have malfunctioned, and your job is to pilot a spaceship to destroy them before they explode. The narrow passage you'll need to fly through is well guarded: deadly force fields appear and disappear, rocket launchers attack, and deadly byte bats will get in your way. Your ship has a limited shield; each time you are hit by one of these enemies, the shield loses energy. When the shields energy is completely gone, the game ends. Also be on the lookout for energy pods which can replenish the shield (these don't appear often, so be sure not to miss one)! To deal with some of the enemies and obstacles your ship is equipped with a laser.

It's hard to believe that the 2600 can do a 3/4th perspective shooting game, but Lasercade is the proof.  The goal of the game is to shoot all the targets in the upper section of the screen before time runs out (that's original).  However, while you can just start shooting willy nilly, you should probably take a second to look at the funny little targets in the middle section of the screen. \n\nIn the middle section of the the screen there are three rotating mirrors.  As you may have guessed, these mirrors can play havoc with your laser if you're not careful.  If you shoot a mirror while it is facing you, it will reflect the laser back at you and you will lose some time and be momentarily stunned.  However if you shoot the mirror while its back is to you, you can destroy it so it won't bother you until the next round.  While this may sound a bit complicated, it's often best just to ignore the mirrors and shoot at the targets themselves.  The number of mirrors can be controlled with the left difficulty switch.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2VfUapQlco","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Lee Actor","Publisher":"20th Century Fox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"ef4119ef-2453-4bc8-aeb2-61807b645b0f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"f3ff61b1-19ab-4dbb-ab5d-99c39f669c6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"e2eb2087-1f7c-4de0-a4ff-09567709cebb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"1fb0384c-7606-4e43-9861-d76f16f84775.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"5bf6c263-00b1-4a7e-bf51-c07325865998.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"9d7359e4-4159-416a-a3ef-530b5d814c7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132387,"FileName":"3357e39a-220a-4706-888a-538d10c3a1dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17517,"Name":"Lilly Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A \"female version\" of Bobby is Going Home of the same year, Lilly Adventure is a 2D Platformer with hundred screens between you and your home.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfYEWLjgvDs","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Gem International Corporation","Publisher":"Home Vision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"10af4882-86db-4f91-8bb2-7799f6cb12db.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"c45378dc-790a-42ca-9714-f8cd125c5368.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"6c494861-2a4f-4847-9139-a0c262576d3d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"9c9ec568-25a2-4c2d-b129-f8de8f36f72f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"13f3bc69-d5d8-45a3-bf00-7ad4867339b1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"9ebac74e-c2e9-4a27-9325-fddfcf303c94.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"1fb6d330-55d6-47b0-9870-c7ed4034f370.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"1387b29c-ab94-4149-bef1-ddcec5fd632c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"FileName":"b9a17e7e-d9fc-4da0-a8ec-213e3d805501.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":17517,"AlternateName":"Jacky Adventure","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"AlternateName":"Wilma Wanderer","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":17517,"AlternateName":"Alices Abenteuer","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":34918,"Name":"Lochjaw","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"You are a diver in an underwater maze.

Mast bombs exploded on impact, but some would sit minutes, hours, or days before detonating. It was up to the British Army Royal Engineers to find and defuse these unexploded bombs (UXBs). There were many types of UXBs and the engineers had to learn each. The bombs did have some things in common: they required sharp thinking, delicate treatment, and split-second timing. in LONDON BLITZ you are assigned to the Royal Engineers and are tasked to keep your sector of London free of bombs. There are several types of bombs, each requiring special skills which you had better learn. Excellent performance will be rewarded by promotions, but damaged property may get you 'busted.'

It's unknown why Looping was never released since the game seems to be finished and was even advertised. One reason may be the high difficulty of the game which really takes away most of the fun.\n\nAs the game title suggests, this game involves looping.  By looping I mean that your plane can only move in circles instead up the normal up, down ,left, right movement of most games.  By pushing up or down, your plane will begin to arch and start its loop (pushing left and right has no effect).  Normally this wouldn't be a huge problem, but your plane also moves very VERY fast, so it's quite easy to crash into the ground or another obstacle before your can complete your loop.  One interesting thing to note is that if your plane hits the top of the screen it will nosedive straight down.  While at first this may seem like a major inconvenience, it can be used to your advantage if you're crafty enough. \n\nThe cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2003.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9CXsXkxOCw","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Coleco","Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"42198d87-9dc1-458b-9a4f-6a92089317f9.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"7e77e3d6-6cf7-4075-8475-b130baf82cef.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"bf2d32a9-c0dd-45e1-8925-7987fcbd1da5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"a1034a6c-479f-431e-b259-edef52cf1f44.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"42b3c15c-46f4-44ad-b2a8-02956ea97af8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"2776dff6-d807-4cb6-8eba-269d0b92db95.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"ddb35415-d103-4577-8ec6-9bd1ce87e5f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133249,"FileName":"35165e51-f7d7-4a4e-8f0c-9ac40ca09926.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17518,"Name":"Lost Luggage","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"You are at the airport attempting to collect your luggage from the carousel.

Anyway, tucked away in the initial limited edition release of Protector was a hidden bonus game Spike Goes Down, a game which is well suited to the Atari 2600 hardware.\n\n \n\nSo, I recently started work on the 2600 version (title tbc) and here's how it's looking so far...\n\n \n\nI've only just started putting in level data, so you can't get very far. (Blue level will finish you off.) With regard to the collectible objects, picking up 4 fruits in sequence will open up the power-ups. (I haven't drawn the 4th fruit yet, so for now it shows as a bronze question mark). The skateboard increases speed (on the x-axis) for a short time - good for negotiating levels with long platforms/small gaps. The down arrow increases gravity slightly - you need to collect several of them to really feel the effect. The red stop sign temporarily slows the scrolling, the silver question mark doesn't do anything yet. Miss a fruit or power-up and you have to start back at fruit 1. I'll almost certainly change the way this works, and the stop sign doesn't really do much for the gameplay so I'll probably ditch that.\n\n \n\nAll feedback welcome.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Alex Herbert","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181126,"FileName":"f897b379-ee30-4e7a-8142-bf94e553b36e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181126,"FileName":"0b360b6c-248c-40a6-97bc-0eb3a3a7b5ea.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181126,"FileName":"440c58ad-65b2-4ac2-8f77-7894c62d72aa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95745,"Name":"Mangia","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Mama Mia!

It was written by Atari 2600 homebrew developer Darrell Spice Jr. and released under his SpiceWare label in 2006. David Vazquez and Erik Ehrling provided graphics and music for the game, respectively. Warlords was first ported to the Atari 2600 in 1981 by game designer Carla Meninsky. Spice's version includes elements of the arcade version that were not included in the official 2600 port.\n\nMedieval Mayhem is an action game that features a king in each of the four corners of the screen. Each king is protected by a brick castle. The object of the game is to destroy the opponents' kings by breaking through the walls of the castle with a fireball. Up to four players can play simultaneously; each controls a shield in front of the castle.

The decision to cancel the game must have been made at the last moment, as advertisements proudly boasting 'Just Released' had already been printed. Although Meltdown was displayed at the 1983 CES show, it was never seen again after the show closed. Long thought lost, Meltdown surfaced in a resale shop in 2004 where by chance it was discovered by a passing collector.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjXXM-kWSWY","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"20th Century Fox","Publisher":"20th Century Fox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133250,"FileName":"8e641615-2a83-4acd-ad57-5da9f0162ae1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133250,"FileName":"c636a77e-9bdb-4760-879e-c1292900f861.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133250,"FileName":"734cc10b-0988-4c96-963f-15a859fd7b79.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133250,"FileName":"c66a3f17-7e23-40ab-8d25-0196305f2594.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133250,"FileName":"451017cf-45c7-4002-b20d-df95abbe87c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133250,"FileName":"472d49bf-0b8b-4088-b142-30f85270a84d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138772,"Name":"Mental Kombat","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"b99fca57-6b63-4d38-97da-460ce29b524f.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"e32d2d1e-b9e9-415b-b19d-60d681a56b0b.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"cb6cbf7f-679c-4974-b470-b16dd12ff2a3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"a96bbecc-3eb3-465e-8e0c-0df17fbc0314.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"dcb2aad8-ba69-4ed5-8dc8-184abb2e9d92.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"cbaf3578-17a7-48cd-b8ec-f2e21668c82e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"ee0bbfe7-ba49-414e-8e61-01e7031aac81.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":138772,"FileName":"7b992def-db2d-44e9-87b7-90bdcb1b50d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128466,"Name":"Merlin's Walls: Standard Edition","ReleaseYear":"1999","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128466,"FileName":"b1873a0c-ed16-42b1-94c5-4045692d8de2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":128466,"FileName":"5007b822-5c54-49dd-8e2b-60bf09917427.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128467,"Name":"Meteor Defense","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Defend the earth from the oncoming meteor storm, you and your ship may be our last hope!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"ITT Family Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128467,"FileName":"0412438b-13c2-4085-a6c8-d2886b4d41ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128467,"FileName":"ca55e697-2f34-4f8d-af75-8b9c2227d90b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128467,"FileName":"0eaf7c19-e262-4534-88f1-d4c52be1f4ae.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128467,"FileName":"1c5f8519-2b78-4005-b8a5-5e5243625d4e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128467,"FileName":"633168c4-605e-4810-a726-bc68ce3c606d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":172882,"Name":"Meteoroids","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"This game is the prototype version of Suicide Mission.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Steve Hales","Publisher":"Arcadia Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172882,"FileName":"75cfb142-bd1e-439f-a3cc-0e2e161fca28.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172882,"FileName":"f1227cd8-f005-4816-ac82-44349a900e80.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5311,"Name":"Midnight Magic","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Midnight Magic utilized the Atari 2600 joystick for performing simulated pinball functions, such as activating the flippers and shooting the ball.

Yes you heard me right, Mind Maze is the first (and only) Atari game to be based on the unproven (yet still popular) theory of ESP (Extra Sensory Perception).  It appears Atari was attempting to develop a sort of \"Mind Reading\" game for its new Mindlink controller.  So can the 2600 really read your thoughts?  Read on to find out...\n\nMind Maze is played somewhat like those old mind reading experiments where a scientist would hold up a card and ask a person to tell him what was on the other side.  Depending on the game selected, two to four cards appear on the screen each round.  The player then must try and guess the \"correct\" card by highlighting it (using the joystick) and pressing the fire button.  Unfortunately this is where the game begins to fall apart.  As you've probably guessed the theory of ESP is pretty far fetched, and the odds that the player can continually guess the correct card is slim.  So the player must simply sit there and randomly select cards until he by chance selects the correct one.  Predictably, this gets boring very fast...\n\nAfter choosing a card all but one of the card pictures will disappear, and the computer will then highlight the \"correct\" card on the screen.  If the player is playing with the \"Race\" option, the game will show a solid blue screen and wait for the player to press a button before continuing to the next round.  This blue screen (which would have been spruced up for the final release) was probably there to allow the other player to get ready for his turn.  However since there is no two player option in this version, it doesn't really serve any point.  The player may also \"pass\" on the current set of cards by pressing the button without selecting a card.  This will cause a new set of cards to appear but it will still be the players turn.  There doesn't seem to be a limit on the number of times you can pass, but the game will not advance until the player picks a card.\n\nThe current score is shown at the bottom of the screen.  The left digit appears to be the players score, while the right digit counts the number of rounds played.  When the player reaches 20 points they win the game and are returned to the main screen.  By setting the right difficulty switch to B, the player can activate the \"Cheat\" mode.  When the cheat mode is activated selecting any card will score the player points (thus making the game completely pointless).  When the switch is put back in A position the scoring is set back to normal (as normal as scoring gets in this game anyway).  The cheat mode was probably put in by the programmer to help the ESP challenged debug the game.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Mind Maze appears to have several options which can be set for each game.  The main screen lists four options: # of Choices (2, 3, or 4), Race/No Race, Picture/Color, and Past/Future.  \n\n# of Choices\t- This sets the number of cards that appears on the screen.  The game defaults to two choices, but can be set as high as four.  Obviously the more choices there are, the harder the game becomes.\n\nRace/No Race - This option is for setting up a two player \"race\" game.  The only visible effect this option seems to have is activating or deactivating the blue screen.  Setting the game to 'Race' causes the solid blue screen to appear between rounds, while setting it to 'No Race' skips this screen.\n\nPicture/Color - This option affects the cards themselves.  Selecting 'Picture' will cause the game to display a series of beautiful pictures on the cards (everything from castles to goldfish), while selecting color will replace these pictures with a block of solid color.  When playing the 'Color' game, the picture actually hides behind one of the cards and is not visible to the player.  Selecting one of the cards will cause the picture to be revealed and the game will proceed to the next round (after awarding the appropriate points). \n\nPast/Future - Out of all the options in the game, this one is the strangest.  As the name suggests this option affects the order in which players try to predict the cards (trying to guess the card that was just played or the card about to be played).  If set to Past the 2600 will select the \"correct\" card before the player chooses.  If the option is set to Future the 2600 will select the correct card as the player chooses.\n\nUnlike more advanced games such as Motorodeo, the player cannot actually change the game options directly.  Instead the player must keep selecting game numbers until the combination of rules he wants is found.  Since there are four different options (one with three choices), there are a whopping 24 different game variations in this prototype (3*2*2*2).  Not too shabby for a game from 1984.\n\nIf you haven't already noticed by the screenshots, the graphics in Mind Maze are absolutely gorgeous.  Each picture is large and well detailed (a rarity on the 2600).  The graphics also have a really cool 'Fade In' effect that adds a bit of eye candy to an otherwise drab looking game.  Excellent graphics in a game so early in the development cycle are rare, as the programmer usually put bland 'placeholder' graphics in until the gameplay was finished.  One has to wonder what other little surprises the programmer had in store for us.\n\nAlthough Mind Maze is constantly listed as being a Mindlink game, this prototype doesn't appear to use or require the strange controller.  However according to the programmers,  Mind Maze was definitely meant to be a Mindlink game.  Supposedly the headband was to read the players Alpha and Beta waves in an attempt to help predict their actions.  However since the Mindlink was really just a sensor that detected muscle movements in the players forehead, this was complete bunk.  The whole mind reading idea was just another angle thought up by Atari's marketing department.\n\nAlthough the theory behind Mind Maze was pretty far out there, it does show just how far Atari was willing to go to develop games for its new Mindlink controller.  Mind Maze was ultimately scrapped due to to the limited appeal of the \"game\" (or perhaps the marketing department finally stopped smoking those funny little cigarettes).  However Mind Maze would not be the last game to dabble in the paranormal, several years later another mind reading game called \"Taboo: The Sixth Sense\" was released for the NES.  Unfortunately this game was pretty much laughed off the store shelves and faded into obscurity.  It appears that Atari made the right decision after all.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTd9YP1k05k","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Gary Shannon","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"66dc124a-5464-4e87-b40e-d90171555faf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"53a4e101-624a-46d2-868f-7115f8d9696d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"9600325c-7e98-4327-ae97-8d3629ef7ba1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"93d49aac-36de-4eab-98c8-baa6f7e5c231.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"44dcdd52-cdc9-418d-beb3-4cf82ce379cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"d4d13789-0bef-44cf-8537-2401790cbafd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"c6634373-7a3c-4258-805d-eefc81eb1a30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128561,"FileName":"e1b52e81-56f8-410f-bebc-9b48e49ba12d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":98707,"Name":"Miner 2049er","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine.

The game was advertised in Atari catalogs, but never made it to final release, due to Atari's cancellation of their Children's series. A prototype of the game was discovered in the late '90s by a private collector.\n\nThe object of the game was for one player to maneuver Kermit through the church and outside to a waiting taxi, without getting caught by Miss Piggy (controlled by the second player), who insisted that they be married.\n\nThe obstacles to Kermit were the wedding guests (represented by blocks in the picture), who try to impede his progress through the maze. He also must touch a key in order to open the doors and escape, although if Miss Piggy touches the key, the doors close again.\n\nThe most complete version currently known for this game was never finished, so the consequences of Kermit escaping or being caught by Miss Piggy are unknown. Additionally, Gonzo appears at the top of the screen as the minister, yet he has no purpose in the game prototype.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVY-7KQk3us","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"a3769e67-7713-4033-acf4-84d5d30e135c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"827fc733-7662-447d-9544-6a982c2c3cde.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"eea2a14e-1500-4426-a65c-812c8d0566bb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"87bc72b6-90a7-472b-8586-6d802b62b128.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"27e516de-f3b0-4a59-b878-b5444a4aa40d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"2c0ffc4f-ed60-4d34-be50-4b7c0d73755e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"d2047bbd-862d-4366-a46e-013b6b5a7ee6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"11465214-c691-405b-9ccb-4903405b3d79.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"a2207ba5-b5e7-4295-9ec7-0d41efc69123.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"b82a7f94-e74c-481d-9f51-62e3801960be.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":95748,"FileName":"4168ff81-8f17-4cce-8b75-e3918c8359c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5313,"Name":"Missile Command","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Aliens from the planet of Krytol are attacking your cities!

The head can blink or nod up and down, the arms can either flap or pump up and down, and the legs can kick out or squat.  After awhile the whole thing begins to look like a creepy exercise video, which may be where the name came from. \n\nAccording to the copyright message this game is part of the Children's Computer Worshop series (the Sesame Street series), but its part number CX-26131 and late copyright date 1984 are well outside the Children's Series range. Atari may have been planning some kind of series for young children and infants in order to reach as wide an audience as possible. There is evidence of this as prototypes for other children's games such as Peek-A-Boo and Honker Bonker fall into this part number range. This prototype even uses the Kid's Controller, which further supports this theory. In 1984 the videogame industry was crashing fast and Monstercise was probably scrapped due to lack of a market for such a game, or even possibly because of the gameplay was too similar to Grover's Music Maker (which was also not released). It's unknown if any more work was ever done on this title.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u--Ag4e0ikA","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"b181c2bc-f0e0-45d3-9b6d-92b4fe76dc33.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"0e10ae8d-8029-4280-90ef-e5ad04fe7635.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"1f45990e-118b-45ad-b3c5-185abd1fbd7e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"56c69bce-6267-45c1-9282-a7b671fed1ef.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"f0ada35a-f46a-4422-942d-f5a96322e432.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"e6a51422-f6e9-45d6-9ba7-07608ec1beff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128399,"FileName":"f5609538-2a9f-46d4-8518-31f81049f92d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":19207,"Name":"Montezuma's Revenge","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"PANAMA JOE, That’s what they call him ‘round these parts; though no one knows his real name or where he comes from.

From time to time you will see a moon pass by, and by flying near it you can descend to the surface. As you sweep along the surface, you will see stranded miners which need to be rescued by flying over them. Also on the moons surface are various obstacles which must be avoided or destroyed, such as towers and lunar satellites as well as alien surface destroyers. Should you survive and rescue six miners (the maximum your ship can carry), then you may take off from the surface by using the accelerator rings. There are several different types of moons found in this quadrant, each with a different level of difficulty.

Some ideas were just too far out there to be marketable (such as Mindlink and Mind Maze), while others were just to niche to sell well enough (such as Mark of the Mole).  Morse Code Tutor falls squarely into the latter category.  Although I’m sure that there were indeed Morse Code enthusiasts who owned Atari 2600’s, they probably didn’t make up a large enough group to bother with.  \n\nLittle is known about the origins of this prototype or if Morse Code Tutor is even its real name.  Found in a box of miscellaneous items from a former programmer, Morse Code Tutor is just what it sounds like: a program for helping the user learn to send and receive messages in Morse Code.  It’s hard to believe that there would have been any market for something like this, but a similar program was released for the Videopac (Odyssey^2) system in Europe so there is some precedence. \n\nFrom the main screen you can select the Word Speed (5-72), Character Speed (5-72), and Pitch.  Word Speed affects how fast the words you need to send appear, while Character Speed affects how fast the individual characters in the words appear.  Pitch allows you to change the tone of the ‘beep’ that occurs each time you tap out a character.   Pressing the button on the screen will produce a tone so you can test out your pitch level. \n\nAfter you’ve selected your options the only way to move on with the game is to move the left difficulty switch to the B position.  This will produce a screen with some letters on it for you to try and signal.  Moving the switch back to A will bring you back to the options screen.  Pressing the reset button when on the Letters Screen will produce different combinations of letters, numbers, and eventually punctuation.  The order is: 5 screens of letters (always in the same order), the entire alphabet, 3 screens of numbers (1-5, 6-0, then all the numbers), the entire alphabet with all the numbers, 3 screens of punctuation characters, then a screen with all the letters, numbers, and punctuation.  This final screen is a bit different as it has a flashing cursor thst you can move and make letters disappear and reappear by pressing the button, but the use of this is unknown.  After this screen pressing reset once more will bring up the word SEND, after that it will repeat back to the screens of letters. \n\nThe prototype itself doesn’t seem to be complete, so there may be more functionality hidden in the code.  Due to the small rom size (only 2K) and bare bones nature of the program, this would have been a very early release (1980 or earlier). It’s unknown if Atari was really planning on releasing Morse Code Tutor or if this was simply a toy created by a programmer playing around in his spare time.    Either way Morse Code Tutor is one of the more unique programs in the 2600 library.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166895,"FileName":"a5a00286-ea51-4894-a1d9-9f2af6f3b121.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133534,"Name":"Motocross","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Motocross is a motorcycle racing game viewed from a top-down perspective.

Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten. Each level has a time limit, and the more levels you complete the shorter the time limit becomes!\n\nA secret area exists high above the mountain. Once reached, there are ways to increase your time, score and even the number of game variations (up to 256).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF6XzTLZLrI","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"E.F.

And it's a lot of fun. The objective is to repeat the color and sound patterns - using Joyboard or Joystick - that Rockin' Rollie creates on the screen.\n\nOff Your Rocker can also be played using a Joystick instead of the Joyboard.\n\nUse the Game Select level to choose the number of players (number will appear in upper left-hand score box.) Pressing the Joystick's \"fire\" button will tell Rockin' Rollie that you're ready to play. When he presents a pattern, you can take as long as you like to study it and make your first move. But once you have started, you only have five seconds between each following move. There are two ways to play:\n\n1. When the Left Difficulty Switch is in the A/Novice position, each player remains on The Joyboard or uses the Joystick until they fail to complete the pattern (at which point Rockin' Rollie will get a little on-screen surprise). The score is noted and the next player can take a turn on The Joyboard or the Joystick and a completely new pattern will begin.\n\n2. When the Left Difficulty Switch is in the B/Expert position, Off Your Rocker is played as a round-robin game. The first player gets on The Joyboard or uses the Joystick and repeats the pattern. The next player then takes their turn. Any player who is unsuccessful will be removed from the rotation. The score will flash to indicate whose turn it is.\n\nThe Right Difficulty Switch does not affect game play. In either mode, after the 7th round, the patterns will get faster.\n\nRockin' Rollie's pattern sequenced can be up to 99 color changes in length. If you somehow manage to complete the entire sequence of 99 (or get even close to it), you will probably have worked up quite a sweat. You might want to consider a shower before you start bragging about how well you've done.\n\nBefore leaving the VCS arena, Amiga had sent its second game Off Your Rocker off to a company to have labels applied. Unfortunately, since Amiga had pulled the plug on its 2600 division, they didn't have the money to pay for labels, so the carts were kept by the label company. Years later the company sold the cartridges off as scrap to a company in Ohio called Pleasant Valley Video who slapped on a homemade, handwritten label and sold them to the 2600 community.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tn-SKqeP5k","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Amiga Corporation","Publisher":"Amiga Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"a8df58bd-d3b6-4a01-91f1-75787ed91a8e.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"20af09f2-a7f8-480a-a835-3ce8e57ce01f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"21316fc4-c8ef-476d-bea5-c78415564d49.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"b946d6c1-b20c-4b1c-894a-f93acc88a421.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"2716389a-965b-4245-823f-360ece19c930.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"0f46cf5e-5fe9-4a43-9b4d-46286103ba72.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"a16100bc-1665-4edc-a5d5-69ce0553808a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128401,"FileName":"fb317c96-f736-43a6-9932-f08c4b45eabd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":7953,"Name":"Oink!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs.

You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy \"Droid\" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.\n\nThere is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.\n\nYou control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.\n\nBouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMZdM7BOM_4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Bally Midway","Publisher":"CBS Electronics","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"855c28ab-7f3e-4c9a-8bee-8091bcb797b1.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"c33fb6ff-0b8e-4def-aecc-294a90edfbc1.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"44d68457-5f65-4fc3-8476-8f7d1a8a23a0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"8abd1197-e9f9-4d93-8a1e-197dafeb3cfe.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"0e8c40b1-45ff-4560-a020-d4a54c9b9baf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"542b1e3a-6035-4add-8341-2c2fb918da1d.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"41dec0df-59b4-4ff1-ab50-bc7551f5173c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"b2e8990f-d6a9-460e-9fa9-ef7032d3cdd4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"fcf21a95-0e58-472d-ba5c-0e937ae37de7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"43a639fb-f3de-4609-8c9e-54f92f7c3e25.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"86c0813b-df66-4e19-9860-5a8cb11c1cec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28700,"FileName":"9c47068c-7a5b-4f69-ba51-b48fb7cf8ba4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174470,"Name":"Omicron","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A team of four agents, each a specialist in one of the four elements - water, fire, air and earth - have been miniaturized to microscopic size in order to investigate a mysterious new virus that appears to be of alien origin.\n\nThe virus mutates rapidly, mimicking each of the four elements.

Before the treasury can be entered, you need to attach ropes to each of the possible locations. To hinder your progress, there are guards wandering each of the floors. If you're caught, you'll lose a life! To help out, a magic ball will appear on screen from time to time; if caught, this can be used to temporarily freeze a guard. When you successfully enter the treasury, you then move on to the next level of gameplay.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nApples and Dolls\nApriti, Sesamo\nI Want My Mommy\nOpen Sesame\t\nOpen Sesane\nOpen, Sesame! - Abre-te, Sesamo!\nOpen, Sesame! - Sesam, Öffne Dich\nSesam Öffne Dich\t\nSesam, Öffne Dich / Open, Sesame!\nTeddy Apple\nTeddy Perdido","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAFIue5ukbg","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Bit Corp.","Publisher":"Bit Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"1663eb0f-d789-4b0f-a162-2834f8bb0504.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"7c8711bf-4596-4c45-9bea-75ab4b7c5ec7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"b306136a-c858-498f-9f51-1b2e9b588707.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"dc269697-4c27-40f6-a051-77def699e028.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"0a172077-4889-404d-88ea-b5f336a5082a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"c75baa7a-227d-40de-b97c-411500c94b1f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"bdd3fe8d-8303-4af5-9aa2-488e6412fac8.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"6ed20a36-64a5-4b0e-8798-5dff435a3c8a.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"0ed97151-92e6-4953-ac17-060eb2d4d37d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133251,"FileName":"9a3f9e33-4bf1-4a4d-8bb6-d78fca7b6196.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":133251,"AlternateName":"Abre-te, Sesamo!","Region":"Brazil"}]},{"DatabaseID":31249,"Name":"ORB","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"ORB\n \nThe planet Orb can be a dangerous place full of mystery.

It is one of the earliest hobbyist-written games for the console. The game, Cavina's first, was initially made available as a freeware 4 KB binary file designed for use on the Starpath Supercharger and with Atari 2600 emulators. It was later released in cartridge form by XYPE, a group of Atari 2600 homebrew developers.\n\nOystron is an action game in which the player controls a ship using the joystick controller, firing at enemies and collecting pearls dropped by \"space oysters\". The player's ship initially appears on the left side of the screen, and enemies attack from the right. Shooting the space oysters reveals a pearl; the player then collides with the pearl and brings it to the \"pearl zone\" on the left side of the screen. Other enemies appear that attempt to steal the pearls. Collecting eight pearls earns the player a bomb.\n\nAt the end of each level, a boss named \"Oystron\" appears; the player can defeat the Oystron by placing a bomb in its path, or waiting until it changes into a space oyster. Following the appearance of the Oystron is a warp phase, in which the player travels at high speed and must avoid colliding with enemies. The player is given four ships at the beginning of a game, and earns an additional ship every 4000 points.\n\nIn 2003, Oystron was one of several Atari 2600 homebrew titles selected by Activision for inclusion in the Game Boy Advance version of their Activision Anthology. In 2005, it was named one of the five \"Best 2600 Homebrew Games\" in the book Gaming Hacks: 100 Industrial-Strength Tips & Tools by Simon Carless, who praised the game's fast pace, sprites and color scheme.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o9xSZK29Eo","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Piero Cavina","Publisher":"XYPE","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"0c805a0a-5e8a-4507-8b2a-e817964c1dd6.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"76723373-3166-49f3-aeef-ac3df03da10f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"ae01e207-3ecf-47a8-8584-50a40c5967d3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"c75850f2-e933-4399-a04c-3a1adb46914e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"ae0bf83e-1af6-49da-9603-8cb1e4066285.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"c2f00162-ca99-4ce1-bc60-40855b3f2b82.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"99e65254-d3b9-47ed-8039-9f4ff1f29c67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164711,"FileName":"2e77d548-616e-4784-951f-d92eab0a0ae9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17526,"Name":"Pac Kong","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Pac-Kong plays very similar to Donkey Kong.

Phantom II is based on an old Bally Midway arcade game of the same name, where your goal is to patrol the unfriendly skies and shoot down enemy bombers! In Pirate, you must explore a dangerous island and find the treasure of evil pirate Chuck DeLuc! The cartridge features a menu that lets you select which game to play upon powering up your system.\n\nFighter Pilots Needed!\n\nFight your way through day and night zones and shoot down the enemy bomber!\nUse the joystick to move your fighter and the fire button to fire missiles. You only get one life, so avoid colliding with the enemy jets (you are safe at the lowest level of the screen)! In the night zone the enemy jets are only visible when the radar wave passes over them. You start with approximately 60 seconds in the guided missile version and 90 seconds in the regular missile version. If you can reach and shoot down the bomber (which requires three hits), you'll be awarded with additional time (represented by a bar on the left of the screen). The enemy jets get more evasive and you receive less time to accomplish your goals with each successive round.\n\nArrrrr Matey! X Marks the Spot!\n\nCan you find the treasure of the evil pirate \"Up\" Chuck LeDuc? Beware! His bony corpse wanders the island looking to protect it! Also watch out for snakes and the voodoo priestess! Use the joystick to move around the island and use your fire button to fight/pick up items or use an item/enter or exit the hut. The window color represents what you are presently carrying (gray - nothing, blue - shovel, yellow - sword, green - shovel & sword). The color of the display in the window shows your health. You start with three hit points (3 - green, 2 - yellow, 1 - red). Snakes have 1 hit point each. The other enemies' hit points are randomly generated. There is a flower growing on the island that will restore your health, but it only works when it is fresh. Only use it when you actually need it! The treasure is marked by an X and you must have the shovel in your possession to dig it up. Can you find the treasure before LeDuc finds you?","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Shooter","Developer":"David Weavil","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"9970aeb0-77aa-4dd5-9469-13dbec7532f8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"3e00d9d6-641c-43fe-8a03-48afe8f705fe.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"54d85298-7de7-45ad-a053-d97bd71d6c4e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"e81c4aa7-5728-4a43-888a-52508373278e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"83eb27c3-c38d-4743-bdaf-b247add79404.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"c233b901-999b-4745-92e8-03a94269e755.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172883,"FileName":"d766c825-11cf-4f28-90d1-24a9f3da9ddb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17527,"Name":"Phantom Tank","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"In Phantom-Panzer, the player takes control of an assault vehicle in order to defend their \"energy base\" at the bottom of the screen from the attacking phantom tanks.\n\nThe game consists of three phases: the first phase takes place in a city and looks like a maze.

Your ship has a limited amount of energy; energy is depleted by warping to new sectors, or by taking damage from enemy fighters. If your energy runs out the game is over, however you can recharge your ship by visiting one of the friendly starbases that are located throughout the galaxy (visiting a starbase will also repair any equipment that has been damaged, such as the photon torpedoes or sector scanner).

On each level there are a variety of symbols arranged in columns on the screen. By moving the symbols around, you need to create columns which contain identical symbols; once all the symbols in a column are the same, that column disappears. Your goal is to earn points and complete the levels by making all of the symbols on the screen disappear. Occasionally, you may become stuck with a symbol that doesn't match anything onscreen; when this happens, you can call for an additional symbol to drop onto the screen. However, as the symbol which appears is random you may need to create quite a few symbols before the one you need appears. Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.\n\nIn addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmahbnijSUc","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Kiss, Dennis M.","Publisher":"Salu","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"c3c470cc-8c26-4f08-a4cc-8cb87e26349c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"24d737f7-2645-448d-a59e-932cad762048.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"665343d2-98ca-4dee-bead-18489b4b6efe.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"e3ceee20-b862-493e-83ee-c4a0995badf5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"868df32a-ca18-4669-8067-330ee45b0951.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"d8c481b8-6aa0-4487-9c6c-9d0348950897.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"866b5ea8-ecb7-4853-a48c-e032de2c2b43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128407,"FileName":"d2fce699-2847-4842-84b8-65f8737b38bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128408,"Name":"Pick Up","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"OK, here's the deal.

The tunnels also contain treasure and scorpions Harry must jump over.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nAventuras em Tongo Bongo\nDschungel Boy\nJungle Boy\nPantanal\nPatfall\nPeetfal\nPetfal\t\nPit Fall\nPitfal\nPitfal!\nPitfali\nPitfall\nPitfall!\nPitfall! - Abenteuer im Urwald\t\nSafari\nTom Boy\nTom Boy (Pit Fall)\nTreasure Hunting","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6JVdioCdl0","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Goliath","ReleaseDate":"1982-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"818acd59-df0c-41ed-9d5d-6185557f4573.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"981def2f-efeb-405c-88dc-cbb3195a42f4.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"e14692d9-6305-41a6-a21e-9f89d57832ad.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"caee47bd-e25e-4104-b96d-640d4b404782.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"3538349e-f224-48bd-833d-ffa89a58ea58.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"6142a7ca-87f9-4a89-9159-c92e26882671.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"f9539f89-51e3-41d6-81a0-bd8f79f86886.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"a128976c-7932-4986-a5f4-be939753b5b6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"f3f03d64-e205-48a1-91d1-2838d1c3d70f.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"9609f1c7-e1d8-4cb7-b307-e4a481d4d154.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"6e15b13e-06b9-488b-a2cd-31056dbe15fa.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"67c206ee-93bc-47d2-8e69-7645c074e737.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"8fb0ff4c-7434-4310-9e23-4660685db84b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"f78de002-3828-4b9d-bd14-bc6d90322158.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"b6862308-9d5c-41c1-88b7-4c887ec23597.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"2a97f693-1318-44b0-85b9-9ce2441a45ab.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"926ae65b-28b8-4e31-b769-1f96e1962ce8.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"89ac5a62-dfa9-4c5e-85a5-ce5fb715de63.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"74fde1b3-28f1-4b3c-b26b-28bb89304945.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"4d473f72-4da2-4f59-b1bd-1d4f4221d8dc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"c5eb92e7-7e4c-459f-9765-2151da70a346.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"79fb1ed3-7bbe-4a11-b18a-3fbcd8c1bbb4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"fa11f0b0-e486-445a-b1c4-c66a69f195df.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"c982dd1e-7322-4730-ba40-eec4253fb0bd.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"9070a80a-6b25-4903-9985-9aa0265c07ac.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"8c14807f-4c65-401f-b6c3-43c9eca7be76.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"3845ebbd-c440-4c92-b2d3-e5cbbff506b7.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"93f0f282-dc59-4814-8f2d-7f6651bc39f2.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"a47ca252-2331-4d27-8ba8-72dff7766aba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"FileName":"83ae4fba-b142-4417-b5fa-4df9b02649a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5317,"AlternateName":"Dschungel Boy","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"AlternateName":"Pitfall!: Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5317,"AlternateName":"Pitfall!: Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"AlternateName":"Tom Boy","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5317,"AlternateName":"Tom Boy","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":174180,"Name":"Pitfall: No Walls","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ever want to see all of Pitfall Harry's Jungle Adventure?

However, after much research it was discovered that this game was in fact really John Marvin's lost Planet of the Apes game. It's obvious that Planet of the Apes still had some work to be done, but was finished enough to go through initial playtesting. However, before programmer John Marvin could finish it, he left 20th Century Fox to go work for Epyx. Since 20th Century Fox closed down its video game unit three months later, Planet of the Apes was never completed and released.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwNeQ6VUdxw","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"John Marvin","Publisher":"20th Century Fox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"182410e0-7abc-48a8-8be4-3db8c59f2573.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"0f688268-346b-410a-80d4-b0e00599aa21.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"630f12cb-df1b-4215-8a25-54d28f0db060.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"68421b52-4944-4919-b3de-55eeaba662f1.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"581324d5-64d3-482e-86d9-b88ed892ce0a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"adc1ae00-2155-469f-9d4a-ad40cfc53caf.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"bae0ac33-1814-46d6-909d-4a1abd8deb12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166981,"FileName":"e95ea284-2a40-47e1-bf66-fc10e145137d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17530,"Name":"Planet Patrol","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"You are on patrol to find and destroy enemy fuel depots.\n\nYour ship flies to the left, while you control your up and down motion.

From box art and a few brief descriptions we can surmise that the game revolved around an Indiana Jones like archaeologist who is trying to find treasures in the ruins of the ancient city of Pompeii. Unfortunately, the only prototype that has surfaced is far from complete. It is little more than a movement demo, although bits of leftover code indicate that other features were planned such as being able to fire bullets and something that had to do with rocks. Unfortunately variable names (BULLETR and DNROCK) are all that remains of these. It's hard to judge a game based on such an early prototype, but from what's been implemented Pompeii was looking pretty good. After several mediocre titles Apollo may have actually had a decent chance with this game, but the crash wouldn't wait for them to prove themselves.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj_9EnYxqvU","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Apollo","Publisher":"Apollo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122358,"FileName":"627c9e05-2f17-41fc-a408-410cb0b129ad.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122358,"FileName":"29d41836-a296-4a4c-b841-d940cf6144f5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122358,"FileName":"1858f13b-50d6-4914-be54-a3c5f6b3654f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122358,"FileName":"f862f58f-1840-4a72-8135-c1de6677ca16.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122358,"FileName":"f6560eec-7c5e-4910-b089-579ec043c082.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122358,"FileName":"d058d535-cdd0-4725-be49-09a0f006ce06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128410,"Name":"Pooyan","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.\n\nThe first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.\n\nThe wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nDuck & Wolf\nEnte und der Wolf (Die)\nPoyan","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUQJRtwywo0","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami Industry Co.

Using lasers to fight the alien space serpent, the Power Lords can gain entry into the rock and search its endless chambers for the glowing touchstone that activates powerful anti-alien weapons and devices.'\n\nPower Lords was based on the 1983 toy line of the same name. North American Phillips (NAP) must have thought that it was going to be a huge hit, because games were developed for the Atari 2600, Colecovision and Odyssey 2. Of these games only the Odyssey 2 version was released and is considered to be the rarest US released game for the system. All three versions play similarly, but the Atari 2600 and Colecovision versions have an additional stage which makes the game slightly more interesting. Like the other versions, the 2600 version of Power Lords is not all that fun to play and the overall difficulty of the game is also rather high. Had Power Lords been released, it probably would have ended up in the bargain bin faster than the action figures did.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAvzfgCPGmw","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"North American Phillips","Publisher":"Probe 2000 / North American Philips","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"57c9bffc-9907-45d9-843e-4b622b56acc8.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"e3c2d956-bcd2-44ad-9a18-12317b1a6f3a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"09e01dc6-8c88-4bfe-8fd7-34d6115408fe.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"b3ef0d2c-ee4b-4d71-8b39-66bf817ac138.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"fad33645-621a-40ed-86a8-d1cf08ff793f.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"644438e0-aaac-473f-a618-f537db4a28a9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166899,"FileName":"7605426c-0766-46a0-81bc-0c3f2669ab52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163480,"Name":"Power Off!","ReleaseYear":"2004","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLJ_IdtqMX4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Eric Bacher","Publisher":"Ebivision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163480,"FileName":"4c18371f-888a-4dbf-acdd-58c1a11e3152.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22174,"Name":"Pressure Cooker","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Pressure Cooker, you are a cook whose job is to fullfill hamburger orders at \"The Grille\".

Your job is to capture the criminal Henri Le Fiend and send him to jail. To do this, you will first need to find evidence against him and return the stolen property. During the game, you control Touche as he drive his car around the town looking for clues and the loot. As you drive around, various obstacles will be trying to stop you: questionable characters may appear and throw flower pots or daggers at you, pot holes may be found in the road, or assorted creatures may run in your path. From time to time, you will see questionable characters hiding in a window; if you jump up and catch them, you may find they are hiding an item you're looking for! If not, you will still get points for nabbing a questionable character and can move on to searching a new location. When you located an item, you need to find the proper building to return or verify the item after which you can move on to finding the next item. The game includes five different cases, each with a unique set of goals and of varying difficulty. Some of the goals you may need to complete are: find the stolen necklace and return it to the gem store, find the gun and verify it at the gun store, find the vase and return it to the museum, or find Le Fiend and book him at police headquarters. Each of the cases has a time limit; if you are unable to complete all of the tasks required by the case before time runs out, the game is over. Each case also takes place in a different part of the city, and the more difficult cases cover more city blocks so there will be a greater area to search!

This game actually started out life as Trail of the Pink Panther by U.S. Games (based on the then current movie), but when U.S. Games went out of business they sold the rights to North American Phillips (NAP) who decided to release their own version of the game through their Probe 2000 division. It is unknown if any work was already done on the U.S. Games version or if any of those ideas were used in the Probe 2000 version of the game. Although Pursuit of the Pink Panther was heavily marketed at the June 1983 CES, it was never released, most probably because the special RAM/ROM chip that NAP used to squeeze all the graphics and gameplay elements into the game couldn't be reliably manufactured. When the first batch of chips came back defective from the manufacturer NAP decided to cancel the game rather than try and find a new source for the chips. The crumbling game market at the time was also a big factor in choosing not to go forward.\n\nDescription: 'Players control the Pink Panther as he sneakily makes his way through several screens, attempting to outwit the Inspector.

You control Q*Bert on the playfield of blocks; Q*Bert changes the colors by jumping to a block which will cause it to rotate in the direction of his jump. Unlike the original game, you don't need to change the colors of the whole playfield, but rather need to form straight line(s) of the target colors, and when you do you can move on to the next round. Of course, to make this task more challenging are a variety of creatures (including a giant rat!) that chase you around the playfield. Each creature is a different color, and if it lands on a block where the top face is the same color then the creature falls off of the playfield, but if Q*Bert gets caught by a creature then a life is lost! As the game progresses, more creatures chase Q*Bert and additional colors are added to the playfield making it tougher to find the target color. There are no longer any discs on the sides of the playfield to carry you to safety, so make sure you don't jump off the edge! To help out, a green ball may appear from time to time; if you catch this, all the enemies become frozen temporarily.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnUiwy0EQ7M","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Wickstead Design","Publisher":"Parker Brothers","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"23280e69-f701-4a5a-b5a7-d56137d826a4.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"0aa862f5-a059-4721-a0c9-a3aa95cb9379.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"8b15a7dc-d033-4d5e-94ac-0399f1355d8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"4965383e-075f-4e56-83b0-97af08f66fcf.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"9d91750f-b2c9-42c4-9d2a-7a8a99fd401c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"9f3dbe65-fd99-4f03-b652-011f5cf35929.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"0dba9f94-aabe-4263-9555-5204ebc9795d.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"4386bace-a0f7-4f52-8bff-92a10b40284d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"45c8425c-bddc-4412-a49b-0ae6e65603ef.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"bf337f73-94c3-4fb8-92ef-909a4c60258c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128412,"FileName":"8982e3b7-616a-4cf1-a770-1809945c072e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128412,"AlternateName":"Q-bert's Qubes","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128412,"AlternateName":"Q-bert's Qubes","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":176945,"Name":"Qb","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Explaining Qb is simple, even if achieving your goal proves not to be.

You will also lose a phaser ball if one of the captors collides with your character. Lose all three phaser balls, and the game is over. Also, there is a critter counter at the top of the screen; if you fail to destroy one of the captors or if one of the escaped Runts runs into a wall, the critter counter will decrease. If the critter counter runs out, the game ends.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q200eB7rJ7w","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"3cd40b68-2424-4f1a-acc4-d34a5be5858c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"d1060dcc-54f7-457f-b1b0-56b071b447ca.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"aa70c4fe-857e-4e07-a96c-4d295114929a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"a36b92c0-da20-44da-9dd6-3cdf54d542e7.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"cec3d1dc-c6b1-4d79-a6f9-aedc571f036a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"c9a5b5c0-35d6-4a03-aa39-c3c29f6f5f93.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"cec43b0b-2813-4452-9b06-09e4d1c397c1.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"5da4610d-6648-4470-8fa8-3104a7b7e1d0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"6162394b-d5b8-4027-ac5e-5509df34f68f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"6979ebc6-9376-4e33-9794-36b986b8bfc6.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"2425c34f-a257-427f-9862-adef736489b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":106311,"FileName":"ef28b60a-9048-409b-80cb-c50e9c965db1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22218,"Name":"Quest for Quintana Roo","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Yucatan Sam explores the temples of Quintana Roo searching for the keys to open the ceremonial vault and acquire the riches inside.  You begin your quest outside the temple; climb your way up the side of the temple in order to get inside. Poisonous snakes and deadly lightning bolts will block your progress here. Once inside the temple, you have a limited air supply so you need to explore quickly.\n\nHidden in various rooms of the temple are numerous keys which are needed to unlock the vault. The keys and some other useful items are hidden in secret rooms which you need to locate by using your trusty pick axe or the flasks of acid you carry. To help figure out which rooms may contain hidden objects, you carry a geiger counter with you; the higher the reading, the closer you are to something of interest.\n\nThe rooms you'll be exploring are guarded by snakes, spiders, and even mummies. To deal with these enemies you carry a gun, and you can also use the acid flasks against them (ammo is limited, so use it wisely). If you are successful in your mission, you may receive a secret code which can be used to begin the game at later levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neCEkVRpnXI","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"VSS, Inc.","Publisher":"Sunrise","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"4993d4b4-b1ca-4a39-a9b6-86c6baf43e99.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"18d9aa02-ceca-4ab3-ade2-c431229c04a4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"43a0c3bd-f93f-4c2b-9206-227b89ffbdcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"0e4b380b-a6e4-4eb1-a094-20f2068e6ad9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"604662b9-480a-42df-8aab-c166c4381b23.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"78a9689e-5a41-4d70-a961-0ea7d8f0c68f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"b11c3d07-bcff-4812-9706-944aa25fcd35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":22218,"FileName":"64386d95-4e1d-4c43-935e-5a4937a533b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":117449,"Name":"Quick Step!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Quick Step a kangaroo and squirrel are competing against each other to earn points by jumping on trampolines. The screen is made up of an array of trampolines which scroll downward. As trampolines appear at the top of the screen, they will be grey in color; as soon as it turns pink, the trampoline is now in play. Each time a critter jumps on a trampoline, the color will change to that critters color (green for the kangaroo, or blue for the squirrel). If you jump on a pink trampoline, 3 points are earned; when a trampoline falls off the bottom of the screen that is your color, 6 points are earned (so although no points are earned by jumping on your opponents color, you want to try to get as many trampolines as possible your color in order to earn points when they reach the bottom). If you fall off of the bottom of the screen, a life is lost; the game ends when one player has no more lives left and whomever has more points wins. A few bonuses can also be found; if you see a white trampoline, that is a magic hat; collect it and then jump onto the same space as your opponent to temporarily stun him. Each player also begins the game with 6 tricky traps; pressing the button lays a trap causing the trampoline to disappear so no one can land there. Each level in the game gets progressively faster; at the end of a level, there will be a single column of fast moving trampolines to jump up, so be careful!\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nKanggaroo, Quickstep.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz65UQ4WnwI","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Imagic","Publisher":"Imagic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"66379369-b38c-40b6-96d2-b4f68cb9f870.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"3b7a0031-1d63-4bfd-96a1-c631039f95b0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"bf216cdc-82cd-4688-8c6d-53f95a569ad5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"5119c939-97b3-42fb-ac69-b8355b1441bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"0f0b6198-bbab-4537-aa0d-ca76b3d140a4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"417d6ceb-cfc7-49e9-9ec4-4e479aafa946.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"98af637b-fce5-46ef-859e-90ab853c1713.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"a4190532-c802-4eef-a22d-5385369bda1d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"a07918b9-8c11-465c-aadf-665f0d925451.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"f72df0d2-cede-455c-9b36-e37219d3d884.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"b1ccff3c-4cbf-4d3c-a4e0-42d73ecfb8aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117449,"FileName":"ae976c2b-0af2-4c13-b63a-064e55cb0ba4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34336,"Name":"Rabbit Transit","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You are a rabbit who is just trying to get to where you can get a mate and make like a mathematician by multiplying.

Never heard of it.\", then you're not alone.  Racer was an original game developed by Roklan for Atari (their first actually), and not based on any existing arcade game.  Now if you're saying to yourself \"Roklan?  Never heard of them.\", then you just need to play some more Atari 8-bit games.\n\nRoklan was a major 3rd party developer of games back in the 80's, making games for the Atari 2600, 5200/8-bit, C-64, Vic-20, CoCo, and even the TI-99/4a.  However Roklan generally did not publish games under their own name, so most never knew they existed.  However for some strange reason, they did publish their 8-bit titles under the Roklan name, which is where most people will recognize the name from (that and from their famous fading labels).\n\nGetting back to the 2600, Roklan developed at least four games for the Atari 2600 but two were never published.  You've probably played Crazy Climber and Gorf, and maybe you've played the unreleased RealSports Basketball, but there was a fourth title that people didn't know existed until now.\n\nRacer was Roklan's first title for the Atari 2600, and as such, is a rather simple game.  The player controls an strangely phallic shaped car which they must maneuver around the screen and avoid crashing into the walls.  The screen scrolls downward, so you are constantly moving forward.  As such there is no gas button, nor is there a brake button.  All you can do as hang on and dodge those walls!\n\nAt the start of the game, the walls move rather slowly.  In fact it is almost impossible to crash into a wall unless you're trying to do it on purpose.  However about every 30 seconds the game will speed up, and the walls will come faster and faster until they become unavoidable to anyone who isn't a Jedi.  This usually happens around the fifth speed up.\n\nEach player starts with three lives, with extra lives being awarded every 30 points.  There are ten different game variations, each one changing the number of players and the speed at which the game starts.  The last two variations are a sort of 'Children's Mode' where the game starts at the slowest speed and never speeds up.\n\nAlthough the one player version of Racer is rather ho-hum, the game really shines in the two player modes.  Unlike most Atari 2600 games, Racer offers two player simultaneous play.  In the two player variations you and a friend square off against one another in an attempt to get the highest score.  Each player can stay on their side of the screen and try to beat the other player purely based on skill, but why would you want to do that?  The best part of Racer is that you can bang and crash into the other player, forcing them into the oncoming walls.  Of course the other player can do the exact same thing back to you, so be careful.  Careful strategy is needed when deciding what the right time is to ram you car into the other player.\n\nWhile Racer is an alright game, it lacks long term playability.  The one player game is too simple and ends too quickly, and the two player game isn't much more interesting.  It was probably for this reason that Atari declined to pick up Racer, and Roklan didn't try and put it out themselves.  Racer has potential, but it needs more variation to make it interesting (different wall layouts, an enemy car , power ups, etc.).  Still, Racer is a rare and interesting glimpse into the secret lives of third party developers.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing; Sports","Developer":"Joe Gaucher","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167037,"FileName":"7530404d-a713-4006-9098-9de059b323fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167037,"FileName":"3b143ce0-beeb-4bd6-91e3-29894fc521cf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167037,"FileName":"cd3ee639-60c5-4160-b3df-7dd752d26290.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167037,"FileName":"80dbac67-e332-4a48-90ea-064e01f8770e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":167037,"FileName":"84aa7db6-4cbd-480c-84a7-b76101561231.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133253,"Name":"Racing Car","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Racing Car, the player accelerates his car while dodging other vehicles on this great highway, but be careful as some cars may be moving very slowly, or worse, heading towards you.\nUnfortunately the game has no graphics or interesting gameplay, being a title almost lost in time.\n\nOther versions with a different title:\nCar Racing\nFree Way\t\nGrand Prize\nHell Driver\t\n\n\nIt's still not known where the initials R.J.P.G. stand for.\n\nThe white cartridge version of Racing Car is extremely rare.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7QYUn9D75Y","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing; Sports","Developer":"Gem International Corporation","Publisher":"ITT Family Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"40ae2705-629c-4270-be16-c813982c69fd.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"6b93e1eb-209e-43e7-88a8-3a775ac07642.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"bf1312e3-35bf-467b-b2ae-4cc9282370a0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"e83c419c-63c6-47fe-a82d-9596f0ceba80.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"9e8dc916-6c30-4ede-9db3-f9f3e77eee39.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"d07e2c52-b1df-4db6-8c08-67de7cb92d55.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"90e90f3a-9005-43dc-bde3-00c09b9cb3ca.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"ffe94652-58dc-437d-97f8-85a71ab95b3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"FileName":"54b833e5-8104-4f81-89a4-a38e43f642e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":133253,"AlternateName":"Hell Driver","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":133253,"AlternateName":"Free","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":22175,"Name":"Racquetball","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"You have been challenged, or maybe you challenged, someone to a game of racquetball.\n\nTo serve, press the red button.

In the game you control Indiana Jones on his quest to find the Lost Ark of the Covenant. The ark is hidden somewhere in the valley of poison. Your mission begins in the Egyptian city of Cairo; next you must find your way to the Temple of the Ancients where there is a secret map room. In the map room you will find a hieroglyphic indicating an object you must have to unlock the secrets of the map room; when unlocked, you will be able to find where in the Mesa Field the entrance to the Well of Souls is located. If you can find your way safely across the Mesa tops into the Well of Souls, you will locate the ark and win the game! The game uses two joysticks for control; one joystick moves Indy around the screen and uses a selected object, the second joystick allows you to select and/or drop objects from your inventory. On the many different locations of your journey you will come across different objects (some hidden) which can be collected to help you out. You may find weapons (like a whip or gun) for defense, or objects (such as a key or money) which can be used to unlock new areas or receive help. You begin the game with three lives, and the game ends when all lives are lost. There are plenty of enemies to hinder your progress, and of course numerous snakes!\n\nThe manual mentions the appearance of a 'special signature' on the final screen if your score is high enough (although this isn’t entirely true). On the final screen showing the Ark, the initials HSW2 (for Howard Scott Warshaw – the 2 denotes this is his second game) appear in your inventory.\n\nA screenshot of Jerome M. Domurat's initials in the 'Valley of Poison' appeared in several publications. For reasons unknown, this graphic was removed in the released version. Also, a second key exists in the program which cannot be found in the game. It seems the key was originally going to appear on the 'Entrance Room' (see the screenshots in the b&w ad below), but due to the way the kernel displays objects, it couldn’t be used.\n\nThe manual also states the possibility of an extra-terrestrial Yar near the 'Flying Saucer Mesa'. This is true and here’s how to find it: go to the 'Flying Saucer Mesa' with the Chai and a parachute. Walk off the bottom of the mesa and drop the Chai when you start falling. The Yar will appear above you at the top of the screen. Uncovering the Yar is required to reveal the initials. \n\nOther versions with a different title:\nCaçadores\nCaçadores da Arca Perdida\nLost Arck\t\nRiders of L.

The one player game starts with a random board and your cursor located in the middle. Above the board is a countdown timer and the player's score is shown below the board. Pressing the fire button of your joystick shows the pattern which you have to find inside the board. Releasing the fire button brings you back to the board where you have to search for the pattern. Pressing the fire button at the right position awards you with the remaining time as points and the next level. Pressing the button at a wrong position shows the small pattern again. The game ends when the time counter runs to 00. To make things a bit more difficult, the time counter runs faster when the small pattern is displayed.\n\nThe Two Players Game\nIf you chose the two players game in the intro, the game starts with two different cursors inside the board and individual scores for each player. The objective is the same as in the one player game: look at the pattern and search for it inside the game board. Both players can watch the small pattern individually, but remember that the time runs faster when the small pattern is shown. Releasing the fire button brings you back to the board where you have to search for the pattern. Pressing the fire button at the right position awards the winning player with one point and the game continues with the next level. Pressing the button on a wrong position shows the small pattern again. \nThe game ends when either the time counter runs to 00 or one of the players manages to reach 9 points. To make things a bit more difficult, the time counter runs faster when the small pattern is displayed. It runs even faster if both players press the fire button at the same time.\n\nThe Game Time Modes\nYou can choose one of the two game modes with the left difficulty switch. The \"Easy\" setting gives you a fixed time limit per level, starting at 90 and decreasing by 5 per level until a minimum of 20 seconds is reached. All following levels give you 20 seconds time limit. \n\nThe \"Hard\" setting gives you 90 seconds at the beginning of the first level. You start the next level with the remaining time of the previous one. This means that the time is running from 90 to 0 and you can solve as many levels as possible within this time. Solving each level gives you a bonus time of 5 seconds.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Simon Quernhorst","Publisher":"Atari Age","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":172885,"FileName":"5c13017e-9f2f-4811-bba2-7f5733ca5a98.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172885,"FileName":"d386f9b5-c8b4-4b16-aeac-2455e80b748a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128469,"Name":"Raumpatrouille","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Another Versions:\n\nUfo Patrol [Fantastic Game]\nUfo Patrol [Fantastic Game]\nRaumpatrouille [Quelle]\nUFO Patrol [Suntek]\nUFO Patrol [Taiwan - Yellow Box]","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmwPlcRHc-4","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Suntek","Publisher":"Quelle","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"1fbbcae6-8df1-4b83-83f0-a89393dc9586.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"858c193c-b483-4092-b734-918d5d2ff296.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"4f035f34-cbac-4cd8-a5fd-2c158b286701.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"c79c8b85-1555-415b-a66d-cf821849ca56.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"1b6bbbbc-233b-4b2a-b45a-90cc2e85e25b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"a800fb22-fb84-4127-ad57-644fdc4fc538.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"944c3069-853b-4142-a50a-0a15d12b017a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"38dc60c1-46c3-4abb-b11c-503ce7eda078.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"7aae7620-731a-412d-a405-c4c20a6f2ee5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"d539f303-b6c8-4128-9451-83fcd234fdde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":128469,"FileName":"b0c15813-61c8-46bc-9588-64cc9fd2b97a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Germany"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":128469,"AlternateName":"UFO Patrol","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":5321,"Name":"Reactor","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Reactor is a conversion of the arcade game. You control a space ship inside a nuclear reactor which you are trying to stop from melting down! The reactor core at the center of the screen is surrounded by a deadly kill wall. Roaming throughout the available space are positrons, neutrinos, and photons, all of which will be trying to knock your ship into the wall. To survive you will need to knock all of these attacking particles into the kill wall to destroy them. As each level progresses, the reactor core will slowly grow in size, making less and less room to maneuver in. Eventually the reactor core will melt down; to prevent this, you need to destroy all of the particles before time runs out! To help out, you start the game with a limited number of decoys. When a decoy is placed on the screen, all of the particles will be attracted to it instead of your ship. If you place the decoy close enough to the kill wall, this will make it easier to destroy the particles. Also inside the reactor are two sets of control rods (located on the left and right sides of the screen); If you destroy an entire set of rods by knocking the particles into them, the reactor core will shrink down in size, giving you more time for your battle.

Atari decided to contract the programming of the game to Roklan who had recently done Crazy Climber for them. Although the game was finalized and given to Atari, they ultimately decided not to publish it. There's no concrete explanation as to why this was, but there may have been some concerns about the gameplay not being as polished as it should be. Earlier versions of the game had a referee who would run up and down the side of the court calling fouls (his graphics are still in the game code, just like at least one player animation and an Atari logo that isn't used), but was taken out due to lack of space. The referee can be seen in early promotional shots of the game, so the decision to remove him must have been made quite late. While RealSports Basketball is an improvement over the Atari's classic Basketball game, it was too little too late. Obviously Atari had some doubts about this title, but it remained on Atari's schedule until late fall of 1983 meaning that they may have been reconsidering releasing it. In the end they decide not to.\n\nAlthough technically speaking this is still a PAL game, the final version was meant to be released as a NTSC game.\n\nThe silver cart, box and manual are reproductions from 2002 with permission of programmer Joe Gaucher.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgWj7ygSHDQ","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Gaucher, Joe","Publisher":"Atari (USA)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"db82076c-3dec-4bb4-a884-32ea4d49adde.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"ecd196fa-604c-43ae-92ae-2fe7938e6363.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"cbfd7e08-5279-47f3-b3bd-5710c0fc4faa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"83f842df-d7e5-4c10-9b89-5abb979b84f7.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"eab54ddf-78e2-4a2f-86ed-56ac19d15985.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"266bf89b-2e1b-4450-a689-14b59c730e3e.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"77b52a38-f5d8-4039-9671-b450990b6202.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"208e2a9e-1e32-40d8-815c-a52e18496400.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"55e1e190-a423-4de1-ac44-d7f780c81ed5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128521,"FileName":"ff7c5d51-cd15-4b58-a521-a42c0bb4ec5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":17531,"Name":"RealSports Boxing","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Released later in the life of Atari's industry-shaping 2600 console, RealSports Boxing puts the player in the role of an up-and-coming boxer.

Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA0VWC9fDDI","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Alan Miller","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"5a183378-d227-4c16-a7d3-bd150295ffef.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"a6118e7c-dbe4-47ff-a095-f47ba6858569.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"b47b33b7-0cfa-42cc-8550-f7949217b9d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"08a11608-48a0-4cf0-95dc-1f7efd664377.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"bd90a029-0eeb-48e7-8e42-7709cf7e4d2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"bbe5fbdb-59ec-411b-9cca-979c68ab2287.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"073b8808-eea9-467b-b8c3-068d07adcb88.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"80215c0d-f978-44e9-8173-8a89c31f1f90.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Australia"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"24aad56a-de38-4d93-9aff-3acc11a604da.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"f108a3d9-6478-4c28-bc54-ae460304e095.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"f0809d22-2f13-4734-ab59-8caa1a440be0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"302a8593-c584-4a98-88c8-536d4a24428a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"a95b9d84-72d9-4a12-affe-0f2b54810a82.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"a38d8514-af6f-4da5-9673-761ae4544272.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"648b9530-4314-4e6b-9812-5d05f5e3aeee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"a4d0fd4b-bdb1-45c1-8e6a-cb85f0ef7653.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"4adb5fe6-378e-4745-835e-30e614448ea4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"420bcb1d-1f19-40a3-ac12-c133f78607fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5323,"FileName":"022f682d-d88b-41a8-be38-4a76d67e69c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":5323,"AlternateName":"Robot Tank: Rebellion der Roboter","Region":"Germany"}]},{"DatabaseID":5324,"Name":"Roc 'N Rope","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Your player is a mountain climber who must avoid cavemen, dinosaurs and pterodactyls as he climbs up the cliff-sides.

While Boris uses \"Upsidasium\" to float the valuables up to Natasha's waiting helicopter, Rocky must fly around and intercept them. When Rocky catches the valuables, he gives them to Bullwinkle for safe keeping.\"  Now I know the show didn't exactly make sense most of the time, but what heck were the guys over at Mattel smoking when they came up with this plot? \n\nTwisted plot aside, Rocky & Bullwinkle is an interesting action game in which you must fly Rocky around the screen grabbing all the valuables before they float up to Natasha.  R&B sort of plays like Kaboom in reverse, and resembles Dumbo's Flying Circus in some respects.  Treasures can be snagged by flying Rocky over them and pressing the button, but since Rocky has puny little rodent muscles he can only hold two valuables at once.  While you can give any treasure to Bullwinkle for points, there is a special combination that is displayed on the screen, these are the two that actually count.  If you give these two treasures to Bullwinkle the screen will flash a bit and the timer will reset to 75, giving you more time to look for the next combination.  However there's another timer which constantly counts down no matter what you do.  When this timer runs out, the game ends.  This timer can be extended by selecting different game variations.  \n\nWhile you're zipping around the screen Natasha will occasionally drop something out of her plane which looks like a row of brown dots (bullets?) which will cause you to fly out of control for a few seconds if they hit out.  Other than Natasha there's really nothing in this game that can harm you, but since this was a kiddie game it wasn't exactly supposed to be violent.  Bullwinkle will occasionally drop a brown box of some sort which allows Rocky to carry six treasures instead of 2.  The left difficulty switch affects how many treasures you need to give to Bullwinkle (one or two), while the select button changes Rocky's control scheme.  Normally Rocky simply moves left, right, up, and down with the joystick as you would expect, but by pressing the select button you can put him in loop mode (indicated by the arrows at the bottom of the screen).  While Rocky is in loop mode pressing up or right will cause him to do a right loop (the long you hold it down the further he goes into the loop), and pressing left or down will cause Rocky to do a left loop.  While this control scheme may sound difficult, it becomes second nature after a few minutes.  \n\nAs if the game wasn't strange enough, you can change the shapes into numbers and mathematical symbols by putting the TV Type switch to B&W.  This makes the game a bit more challenging because now the player must add or subtract the numbers they catch to equal the number Bullwinkle is displaying (ack! edutainment!).  In this mode the left difficulty switch controls the difficulty of the numbers (1 or 2 digits).  As with the treasure variation, you can give other numbers to Bullwinkle for points, but they don't count towards the solution.  This variation also lacks the 'storage box' that is present in the treasure variation.  \n\nThe amazing thing about this prototype isn't the gameplay, it's the graphics.  It's simply amazing how many items are moving on the screen at one time with absolutely no flicker.  The train circles the bottom of the screen puffing smoke, Bullwinkle circles around the sky in his plane, Natasha moves back and forth in the helicopter (shooting at Rocky), and tons of valuables constantly move up the screen.   All of this action actually makes it the screen a bit busy, which has to be a first for any 2600 game.  \n\nThe 2600 version of Rocky & Bullwinkle was actually designed before the Intellivision version, instead of the other way around as was usually the case.  Even though Rocky & Bullwinkle was complete and passed quality assurance, it was canceled for unknown reasons.  The Intellivision version was still on schedule to be released, but Mattel closed their doors before it could be completed.  The rom file for this game exists, but has never been publicly distributed due to copyright reasons.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Steve Crandall","Publisher":"Mattel","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166896,"FileName":"43a7036b-16fb-48cb-a062-5e88b5c39992.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":166896,"AlternateName":"Rocky and Bullwinkle","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":128414,"Name":"Room of Doom","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"You are trapped in a room with a monster.

Haven't you always wished you could just floor it and zip in and out of traffic, blowing up all the cars that were in your way?  While you may not be able to do it in real life (not without a lengthy jail sentence anyway), here's one game that will let you live out your fantasy on the 2600.  Rush Hour is one of the long lost Commavid games that everyone assumed existed somewhere.  Not only was Rush Hour advertised in catalogs, but prototype boxes had already been produced hinting that the game was almost finished. Sadly Rush Hour, along with Underworld and Mission Omega, never made it to store shelves before Commavid folded.  \n\nRush Hour is a driving/action game similar to Spy Hunter, but turned on its side.  Your goal is to zip in and out of traffic on a five lane highway, and destroy the five car carriers that are causing the traffic jam.  Your car comes equipped with two laser headlights (they come standard with the deluxe package), which you can use to shoot any cars that get in your way.  However once a car is destroyed it will turn into a deadly pile of debris which cannot be destroyed.  You can avoid the debris by changing lanes, but since this is rush hour finding an open space can be difficult.  Alternatively you can also burn cars to a crisp with your red-hot exhaust (I'm sure the environmentalists just love your car), this is useful for those pesky cars that like to sneak up behind you.  Also on the road you'll also see what appear to be oil slicks, but in this prototype the code to handle them is not present.  \n\nAs you zip in and out of traffic you'll undoubtedly get hit at least once.  Thankfully your car is alot tougher than it looks and won't be instantly destroyed.  However depending on the severity of the crash, your car will take some damage which will affect how it functions.  The damage will be repaired over time, but you can also repair this damage by stopping on the top of the bottom of the road.  However in the time it takes to repair your car, you may risk letting the carriers get away (as shown on the radar at the bottom of the screen).  Interestingly there's a bug in the code that causes your car to get repaired past the normal limit (this was due to the programmer confusing hexadecimal with decimal notation).  \n\nOnce you've reached the carriers you must carefully watch and shoot each one as it unloads its car.  Before a carrier unloads a car it will turn orange and flash briefly, it's during this time you must shoot.  As you're shooting the carriers be careful to avoid the cars that are unloaded as crashing into one will almost certainly result in your untimely demise.  Also take note that you only have one life in Rush Hour, lose it and it's game over. \n\nAlthough Rush Hour is playable, the prototype still has a bunch of bugs that needed to fixed before it was released.  The most serious of these bugs is in the display routine, which will cause the screen to jump unexpectedly from time to time (especially when you reach the carriers).  Other bugs include slight graphic and sound glitches, nonfunctional oil slicks, and inaccuracies in the radar.  It seems the game was in the process of being debugged when the programmer was involved in a serious car accident (how's that for irony?).  Due to this accident, Rush Hour was delayed and never completely finished. \n\nCommavid was always known for their interesting games, and Rush Hour is no exception.  Rush Hour was one of the first games Commavid not programmed in-house; instead it was contracted out to an independent programmer.  It appears that Commavid was finally starting to make some headway towards becoming a larger player on the 2600 scene; unfortunately the market crash put an end to those dreams.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Ben Burch","Publisher":"CommaVid","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166898,"FileName":"670db7c9-c0fb-40f0-9ed9-147f60b4fa5a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":166898,"FileName":"b00ce747-b689-458b-b427-ba7f5480df0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":143150,"Name":"S.A.C.

Unfortunately, even in a galaxy far far away not everything is as peaceful as it first seems, for Hotot has discovered an alien missile base hidden on his planet. Manned by strange blue aliens, these evil intruders are using your planet as a launching site for their deadly warhead which is posed to destroy the galaxy's power source. With the help of the birdlike Gorfons, you must destroy the warhead, and prevent the destruction of the galaxy! Good luck Hotot. You are the Saboteur.\n\nOn the first screen, you are trying to prevent the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves from completing a missile. You will be helped by the Gorfrons. While the Qotile construction robots and Yar slaves will build up the missile, the Gorfrons will steal pieces to lower it. Beware of the Master robot on the top catwalk as it will try to shoot you and the Gorfrons to prevent your interference. After you finish the Rocket Construction Site, it is off to Warhead Assembly.\n\nIn Warhead Assembly, you must destroy the warhead parts on the conveyor belt. There is just one little problem; the conveyor belt is protected by a field. The good news is that the Master robot's energy is on the same frequency so what you do is shoot the Master robot and the shot will then head for the conveyor belt. Of course, the Master robot isn't just standing there, letting you bounce shots off him. He has released a security drone that bounces around the screen trying to hit you.Also, the Master robot will hurt you if you touch him. If you destroy the parts before time runs out, you will advance to a harder round.

It's your duty to patrol your section of the ocean in a semi-organic submarine called the Manatee. Highly aggressive seaweed surrounds you and it keeps trying to replicate faster than you can shoot. Use your torpedoes to blast any bits of seaweed that appear before they clog up your sector and spread to others, making it nearly impossible for anyone to travel. Don't let the seaweed strangle your civilization to extinction.\n\nSeaweed Assault is an engaging and original homebrew title for the Atari 2600 by Duane Alan Hahn. You must deftly pilot your Manatee, avoiding seaweed that can damage your vessel, as well as Wrothopods, a protected species of cephalopods that travel deep to feed on parasites that attach to mature seaweed. Your goal is to keep the sea lanes free of seaweed, and to that end you must blast the seaweed with your torpedos. However, watch out for mature seaweed tentacles that reach up from the depths to try and grab your Manatee!\n\nSome relief is offered in the form of Homing Health Canisters, which appear after you've shot 100 bits of seaweed. The more quickly you grab a canister, the more health units will be replenished for your Manatee. Be wary of corroded Homing Health Canisters, which you may uncover when clearing bits of seaweed! If you don't salvage these in time, their damaged circuits will home in on the Manatee and try to ram it, causing damage that will take one health unit to repair.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163550,"FileName":"0a6d6294-b1cd-4ac7-8e71-4e2bc2d59016.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163550,"FileName":"7bcc20ec-e3fe-41c3-abcc-ec5115b45248.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163550,"FileName":"10197b3f-574c-4bf9-8f02-06f86a16abb7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163550,"FileName":"b918e518-a958-4627-9649-a56fde6d79fd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163550,"FileName":"5da00313-80ef-4dd2-87c8-a793baf01b81.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163550,"FileName":"6b41db41-d636-4fab-9188-98ddf79d3879.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163650,"Name":"Seawolf","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This game is inspired by the Brøderbund game Seafox and the Midway coin-op games Sea Wolf and Sea Wolf II, although it is not a direct conversion of any of them.\n\nYou are a submarine along the bottom of the sea.

You need to fly around the screen and destroy all of the creatures by hitting them with your lance (careful, if they hit you instead you'll lose a life). After all of the creatures are gone, you enter the second screen which is inside the castle. Here there is a large pit of lava and a flying dragon. To destroy the dragon you need to hit it's stomach with your lance. If you are hit by one of the dragon's fireballs you'll be temporarily stunned and unable to fly. If you end up falling into the lava, you'll lose a life. If you can defeat the dragon, the game repeats at a higher difficulty level. The game ends when you lose all of your lives.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Xonox","Publisher":"Xonox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133531,"FileName":"1cfd6a43-b987-4ed6-acc4-4443483dccb9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133531,"FileName":"a1ebe212-6846-4922-8008-ce412796f7ec.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133531,"FileName":"f8ea0b56-6c4e-4140-87d7-9f9327eade3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133531,"FileName":"6a706ba0-22ba-4a82-bd4c-1572efe26121.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28703,"Name":"Skate Boardin'","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"One of the first skateboarding-based video games, you have five minutes to get from your front steps to the steps of the school.\n\nThe player must locate and successfully negotiate thirty hidden tricks in the form of ramps and pipes within a time limit.

When you kill the enemies, some will drop fuel that you can get to replenish your supply. After you have destroyed the wave of ships, you must face two morphing Kh'rylian Destroyers. These do not drop fuel and take several hits to kill. After they are dead, the next wave begins.\n\nSome variations to this game are:\nThe standard default play\nLaser fire that moves left or right after it is fired when your ship moves\nNo shields\nEnemies that disappear and reappear","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99ZKgUURklg","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Dave Neuman","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":"2006-12-05T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163648,"FileName":"ec2348e6-0209-4723-89d0-c378001eb779.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163648,"FileName":"279d72b3-1589-4e6f-8a7c-90849bfe721a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163648,"FileName":"7b9b60ac-c10f-41a1-8c63-03a58468b867.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163648,"FileName":"bfbe29f4-0ae1-4e51-9a6b-1ac13adeffd0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163648,"FileName":"467e9109-647f-47cb-b107-6956ace70a67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163648,"FileName":"66384c9d-5901-4f38-988f-bae43e7c5b0e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174215,"Name":"Space Canyon","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Your Tactical Advanced Weapons Tank (TAWT) is out on a routine patrol through Sighah Canyon when it is suddendly ambushed by the Polydites, a hjostile warring faction.

It was once thought that Spinning Fireball, along with Pizza Chef, Immies and Aggies, and A Mysterious Thief, were all original games developed by a PAL company called Suntek.  However after much research it has been determined that these are in fact original NTSC games released by two different companies called Zimag and Vidco, which may have been related somehow.  So why were these games developed for the NTSC market but never released?  Read on to find out.\n\nSpinning Fireball is a half hearted attempt at a 3D target shooting game.  This is probably something that shouldn't have ever been attempted on the 2600, but Vidco decided to try it anyway.  The result is a game that looks decent, but plays horribly.  The goal of the game is to have your wizard create and shoot a fireball at the catapult that movies across the top of the screen.\n\nThe controls for Spinning Fireball are bit difficult to master, which is just as well as you probably won't want to play this game very long.  To create your fireball, simply push and hold the joystick forward.  Once the fireball starts to spin (hence the name Spinning Fireball), press the fire button to shoot it.  The direction the fireball flies is based on the direction it was spinning when the button was pressed (sort of like the hammer throw in Track and Field).  If you are facing right the fireball will rotate clockwise, otherwise if you left the fireball will rotate counterclockwise. If your shot actually manages to hit the catapult (and good luck with that), then you will be taken to the second level. \n\nWhile Spinning Fireball may be short on thrills, there are some dangers you will face during your fire slinging exploits.  If your fireball hits the sides of the screen it will bounce back at you.  Likewise if you shoot your fireball straight up, it will come back down (run!).  If you manage to get hit by your wayward fireball, you will lose a life.  Also, the catapult at the top of the screen will occasionally shoot a fireball at you, as you may have guessed, being hit by this fireball will also result in losing a life.  You also have a limited amount of time to finish each level, if the timer hits zero you will (say it with me now) lose a life.  The timer starts a five minutes for the first level, and decreases one minute for each successive level (down to two minutes starting on level four).\n\nWhile it won't win any awards for good graphics or gameplay, Spinning Fireball is an interesting attempt to breathe some innovation into the tired old shooter formula.

Are there really suitcases full of money at the top of those unfinished buildings downtown? The ones still under construction? And those suitcases, they're just there for the taking? You would never have believed it except that the guy who told you about it, a regular union guy like you, just bought a brand new Corvette. You know that two weeks ago he didn't have that kind of money, so you guess he's telling the truth. When you asked him how come he didn't get the rest of the suitcases, he got an odd look on his face and wouldn't say another word. Strange...\n\nYour objective in Squish 'Em is to climb those 48-floor buildings to grab the cash-filled suitcase at the top of each one. As if scaling the heights of the buildings was not dangerous enough, you have to be alert for falling bricks from above and watch for creepy critters who've made these buildings their home! Once you reach the top of each building, you can grab the suitcase and continue to the next building.\n\nAlong the way you'll encounter a wide range of critters that you must avoid or jump over. You can even squish the creatures with your feet, but you can only squish each creature once before they turn white with rage and pop back up, looking for revenge! Once a creature has turned white you cannot squish it again! In addition to the creatures, each building has a bonus item that you can collect to receive an extra man.\n\nSquish 'Em was written by veteran Atari 2600 homebrew author Bob Montgomery, who has several previous 2600 homebrew games under his belt, including Go Fish!, Reindeer Rescue, and Elevators Amiss. Squish 'Em is a near flawless port of the old Atari 8-bit computer name of the same name--fans of the original game will be pleased to see this impressive and addictive incarnation of the game on the Atari 2600!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Interphase Technologies Inc.","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"2007-12-14T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":163643,"FileName":"a6cdb030-ec98-4c36-91c6-648fb9310a9b.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163643,"FileName":"e7635a28-7eab-4a8c-9514-44317b9a803f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163643,"FileName":"1c484588-0107-4f23-87fc-dbbd257a3197.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163643,"FileName":"5c1bb2a1-4916-4c59-9789-9d137e798bf5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163643,"FileName":"5e4dce38-b386-437e-8bcd-3d7ff5d0df0d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163643,"FileName":"7082aef2-cc7b-462e-9afa-e5b4c72cfa9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128432,"Name":"Squoosh","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Apollo","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"170564d5-8d2a-46af-a26f-130976a17ad5.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"bd21d78f-8839-40ac-aa7b-17e7fa40460c.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"006b3589-d426-486f-80fd-baef8f6f73cc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"ce811d6b-51b2-44c8-bc9f-9b03f0d99788.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"36d26a43-a9fc-4a87-a40d-da86744ad053.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"5bbfd350-3f7d-4796-954b-28070fc91ba8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":128432,"FileName":"ae35a34d-b5aa-4cb6-93fd-3aea726956ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22184,"Name":"Sssnake","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are a daring big game hunter on an expedition into the heart of the Amazon's legendary lost world.

As soon as Earth moves into range, the weapon will be fired and destroy the planet. The player controls a spaceship launched at the invaders in an attempt to destroy the weapon before it can be fired. To do so, the player must bomb five red weapons silos in a narrow trench. If one of the silos remains when Earth is in range, the planet is doomed;[4] George Plimpton bragged that the game depicted the \"total destruction of a planet\".\n\nThe player's spaceship is equipped with lasers and bombs, both in unlimited supply. The bombs will be dropped on the weapons silos, while the lasers can destroy enemy spacecraft sent to intercept the player. While the player has only one spaceship per game, the spaceship is well-armored and can take multiple hits, but each hit will cause some form of temporary damage affecting the player's control of the ship, such as decreasing its maneuverability or causing sporadic faults in the weapons systems. A hit will also cause the ship to lose altitude, making it extremely dangerous when flying low. If the player's ship collides with the trench or an alien fighter, the game ends and Earth is destroyed.\n\nThe game's scoring takes the form of a countdown timer. Starting at 8000 points, the timer counts down to zero, at which point Earth is in range of the enemy weapon. When the player destroys the fifth silo, the alien vessel is destroyed and the timer stops, thus representing the player's score for that game. Points are added to the timer for each destroyed alien fighter, giving the player additional time to complete the mission.\n\nAt higher difficulty levels, each silo must be hit on its first pass. One game variation starts with zero score and points awarded for each silo and alien fighter destroyed; any missed silo ends the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO_XSmMKqp8","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"M Network","Publisher":"Mattel Electronics","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"4bb8d21a-2489-4505-b369-39fd78a59eea.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"0012efda-f844-4031-91cc-d560ab3cc42c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"02f20094-ff53-40b4-a3c7-d21f47ebc7d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"9c636677-9943-4989-b0a9-87eeea8b8bfc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"79b2f24b-47ed-4131-903f-099c2f50d71f.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"99e435bc-2b5d-448b-87f4-1da28b0bf89b.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"e9c7059f-dd0f-4af8-970a-2abb38c780f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28694,"FileName":"41e713cb-6af3-4b24-a0ec-d569b67b15cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28696,"Name":"Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Star Trek: Strategic Operations Simulator (also known as Star Trek: SOS and Star Trek Arcade) is a space combat simulation arcade game based on the original Star Trek television program and movie series, and released by Sega in 1983.

When all the correct words were found, you could send them to Atari in hopes of winning the SwordQuest contest that this game was designed for.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":1372,"FileName":"8b38eba7-69ba-4e0a-bf54-e6598aa06d73.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1372,"FileName":"89cc5556-4358-4c7f-9356-9a8d628b5bd7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":1372,"FileName":"ce4e1b80-d501-4e24-aee2-64835d283067.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":22198,"Name":"Swordquest: FireWorld","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Welcome to FireWorld.

If the player is caught by the IRS agent, he is audited, and always loses the audit, which takes 50% of his income.

You have ninety-nine seconds to destroy the number of beacons indicated by the number on the bottom right of the screen per level.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E3CsPxe5mY","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"David Lubar","Publisher":"Spectravision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"42b26254-9c12-4176-b3c1-a34abc0a4762.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"0d9a6d4a-3473-47a9-a9c7-f448e13e4209.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"ae23dbf7-f3db-4b2d-b1e1-84e7a4ebfc27.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"a02bd563-be0d-4e59-9839-4cba27be94b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"7e782432-4d40-4391-ab53-82e8ef2f1c01.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"b09ce411-033b-41ef-88a1-9e656eccabc3.png","Type":"Box - Back - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"afeb2384-77bd-4c39-9e29-8329a07894a0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"42f9ebce-36e2-4139-b1a6-8ce6ec72ffba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"32c42bdc-d5be-4260-ba0f-1f1f665dea72.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"1d83ddb7-e8a5-4ace-85da-93941f47e183.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"567fb3e1-2b2d-493e-980f-00ebc81975aa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"1612785b-c27c-4a2b-b82b-25fa118c5f8a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"ed264139-1bdb-409c-9edd-b4b7f537dc27.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"33165d7e-a9a3-4098-ba37-5f57a26a698a.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"de3b7e92-1f85-4a40-8a35-899514a5b1fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":28589,"FileName":"68cd1482-bc97-45ed-9854-a6f78fff8abb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":28589,"AlternateName":"The Challenge of...

Players take on the role of the Duke boys driving the infamous \"General Lee,\" while trying to avoid the police and rescue their sister Daisy from Boss Hogg. While development of this game was reportedly complete, it was not commercially released (and thus it never recieved a packaging design, official instruction manual, etc).\n\nDukes of Hazzard is not really a prototype. The game was actually burned onto regular ROM chips that were just about to be put into carts and shipped when Atari abruptly decided to cancel the game. According to the programmer Mark Hahn the game was still being worked on, so it is a mystery as to why Atari would go through the expense of manufacturing ROM chips. It appears that Dukes of Hazzard may have been the victim of internal Atari territoriality. According to Hahn he and his group were stationed in New York, while the bulk of Atari's programming staff was located in California. Apparently the California group didn't give the New York group much help or guidance and they were sort of forced to wing it.\n\nInterestingly, this wasn't Atari's first attempt at a Dukes of Hazzard game. Atari had previously attempted to rework the graphics in the unreleased game Stunt Cycle into a Dukes of Hazzard type game. It's unknown why Atari abandoned the Stunt Cycle version, but it may be because it was too outdated by the time it was ready for release. This may explain why Atari was so eager to get this Dukes of Hazzard game out the door as quickly as possible (or perhaps Atari's use of the license was about to expire). Either way, the game was never released.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAMrBHh0YR8","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Racing","Developer":"Mark R.

I've always thought that the extra effort that goes into a title born of passion for a particular genre or console really shows when playing such a game. Thrust is regarded as one of the best homebrew games for the Atari 2600. Loosely based on Gravitar, Thrust offeres amazing control, great game play and insane difficulty.\n\nThe cover above is actually from Thrust+ (i believe) released in 2002 with support for a wide variety of controllers. The difficulty of Thrust doesn't impede on the fun of the game. It's control is so good, it's difficulty is an attribute as one masters the best way to handle situations as gravity pulls you downward.\n\nThrust Story Arc:\n\nThe Intergalactic Empire has captured several battle-grade starships in reparation for an attack by the resistance. Their weakness is an inability to power these starships, called Klystron Pods. As a member of the resistance, your job is to steal the Klystron Pods from the Empire's storage planets. The planets are heavily armed and well defended by Limpet guns. These guns can be taken out by firing on their reactors. This will temporarily disable the guns, but too many shots will cause a critical state in the reactor - blowing up the planet.\n\nIf the planet explodes before you retrieve the pod it will be destroyed in the explosion rendering your mission a failure. If you already have the pod and can escape prior to the reactor reaches a critical phase, you are generously rewarded with bonus points.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Xype","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"a6c8fa49-be7f-469d-b94b-e93909715ae6.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"bf41f632-d599-4c0e-bd9c-2ee90246083a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"91dbd258-78eb-495d-9f48-93d79fb90727.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"ef1bd69a-2e22-42d3-a0a0-fd67757c8aef.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"48bf9187-9745-4a32-8872-1aefc8e89a2e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"c25576ce-e841-4200-af76-847129a04919.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"8ff0629c-bbcf-43d3-b0c0-a4cdca572a51.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"a531eb32-8b63-4240-a0ba-de98869cc299.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"caa478ef-0ca5-4276-ad2e-a369080fa0d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"b86cf66a-1aaf-4063-bd6f-0b4746df303c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"bf053641-6ea1-4ca5-b3bf-061ecaacbbec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163547,"FileName":"8ed5e2f2-c128-4b07-830d-fe36a01c7dda.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163546,"Name":"Thrust+ Platinum","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163546,"FileName":"079d6e2e-f7b9-4575-b71e-6db98e4da887.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163546,"FileName":"de5c0771-f97a-48cb-a5f7-c1633eb4fffa.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163546,"FileName":"149586e6-9006-4401-a33e-32132cb72034.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163546,"FileName":"a826edc7-e053-4acf-b89a-0691aaacf4b2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163546,"FileName":"7c359c0d-083e-488b-ba33-a094f25489e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163546,"FileName":"1b01b01c-4762-4189-bf14-f46d02cff661.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":28697,"Name":"Thunderground","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Your mission is to use your Core Capsule to destroy all 6 nuclear bases located on the planet surface.

And not that you needed the additional pressure, but you also have a daily quota to meet. You must properly paint all the toys that appear on the conveyor belts each day before the whistle at the end of your shift sounds!\n\nSanta's counting on you to ensure that all the toys are painted correctly! Can you get the job done before Santa's sleigh is loaded up on Christmas Eve? You don't want to be responsible for children waking up Christmas morning without toys under their trees, do you? Time to juggle those cans of paint and get moving!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YOHq1b7H7c","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"AtariAge","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseDate":"2006-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":24955,"FileName":"0257768a-bee5-4ced-85ae-bf3d43bea2b8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24955,"FileName":"c6caead6-6666-4580-b730-2f6a2d42b38d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":24955,"FileName":"7d0740a3-6cb6-4b48-b9b0-1bd69c02f351.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":24955,"FileName":"8cdaea2c-7e9a-40b9-9fb4-ba65282c6493.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":29507,"Name":"Track & Field","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Track & Field, known in Japan as Hyper Olympic (ハイパーオリンピック?), is a 1983 Olympic-themed arcade game developed and published by Konami.\n\nThe arcade version was released in 1983.

The joystick can be used to raise and lower the blinds by pushing up or down. When the blinds are raised a nicely done sunset is visible out the window. \n\nThe story behind the Venetian Blind demo is rather interesting. As most people know, Activision was founded by several ex-Atari employees who had left due to Atari's policies on programmer recognition (or the lack thereof). One of these employees was Bob Whitehead, creator of the \"Venetian Blinds\" technique, which was first used in Atari's Video Chess to display eight objects in a row instead of the normal six. Even though Activision had never used the Venetian Blinds technique in any of their games, that didn't stop Atari from threatening to sue Activision for \"stealing\" the technique along with other various proprietary information. \n\nSince Activision knew that they hadn't stolen anything from Atari, they decided to play a little joke on Atari. According to David Crane, when the Atari's lawyers questioned them about the \"stolen\" Venetian Blinds technique David showed them this demo and said \"Is this what you guys are referring to?\". Apparently Atari wasn’t in a laughing mood, and they went through with the lawsuit. In the end Atari ended up losing the case and Activision went on to become the most successful of the 2600 third party companies. \n\nAlthough Activision never made a game out of this demo it didn't go completely to waste. The sunset was later used in the background of Barnstorming.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Life Simulation","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127969,"FileName":"64a901e6-a8e3-4477-b979-11d4443395d5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":127969,"FileName":"4d0571d5-2c16-41fe-8c67-83c9de1575b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127969,"FileName":"2c51bd6a-1e0c-4587-b568-eeb554a74cd4.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":127969,"FileName":"fd0b6bb6-799a-4975-9169-6096c6bacba5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":127969,"AlternateName":"Venetian Blinds Demo","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":1358,"Name":"Venture","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Venture is an action game in which you control Winky, the heroic adventurer.

Then, using Paul Slocum’s Sequencer Kit, I was able to assemble a working file that I could test out on the Z26 emulator.

Wings features a fairly sophisticated control panel (for a 2600 game), containing seven different gauges that let you keep tabs on your fuel, power, airspeed, altitude, radar, horizon, and compass. \n\nTwo different versions of the prototype binary exist, one NTSC and one PAL. The NTSC version of the game is dated four months earlier than the PAL version, and is noticeably different. The NTSC version is playable, but is missing the enemy planes and has numerous bugs. The PAL version is more complete, featuring a nice Wings logo and enemy planes, but also contains a bug that causes the game to crash if you continually pull back on the joystick while taking off.

The game was not advertised or released by Atari. Wizard uses a 2K ROM, the last Atari 2600 game developed by Atari with less than 4K. Wizard was eventually released as part of the Atari Flashback 2 package in 2005.\n\nThe player is a wizard from Irata (Atari spelled backwards) and battles imps in a maze. It's not a symmetric battle: the player is faster than the enemy, but the enemy can go through walls and fire faster than the player can. There is no need to aim, as the angle of the player's fire is automatically sent in the direction of the enemy. The enemy remains invisible when it is behind a wall. It also has heart beat audio, which becomes louder as the player gets closer to the enemy.\n\nThe production of Wizard is detailed extensively in the book Chris Crawford on Game Design. Crawford wanted to write software for the new Atari home computers, but Atari management required developers for the system to create an Atari VCS game first.\n\nWizard was never released for the Atari VCS. It was first released on the Atari Flashback 2, 25 years after it was written. Its developer, Chris Crawford, was not even told about Wizard's eventual release on the Flashback 2, and learned about it in an email from a fan. Crawford's original prototype did not contain a two-player mode, but the game released with the Atari Flashback 2 does.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Chris Crawford","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"a942e2f6-be3f-4d19-ad76-c9568876161c.png","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"80f73074-c7d8-4094-93d7-08cf7c6cf133.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"2d228c08-3e22-4ef6-b756-cec1a4bea527.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"186f70f7-24c0-4923-aec0-fff94177bf8c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"361ced83-6e7a-43a1-a37c-272f2b53c117.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"c4c58f65-9058-40d2-a73b-e0c7148b5a5b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"5a0c463f-9f9f-4b10-bde8-80b75f76932e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164713,"FileName":"f4bdef9c-a042-4cfa-961b-57dfbdf0d773.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":1360,"Name":"Wizard of Wor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.\n\nThe player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon.

Each of the two games was released separately, though it's generally more common to find them in this form. This particular double-ender is the most common to feature either of these games.\nThe Double-Ender is two games in one - each end of the cartridge has a different game. These cartridges are about 2.5 inches longer than a standard cartridge, and the case is wider in the middle. There is one long label that is typically blue, with game art for both sides split diagonally down the middle. Titles are printed in red text against a yellow banner. All the titles found on the Double-Enders can also be found in standard single-ended cases.\nXonox, based in Minnesota, started developing Atari cartridges during the height of the 2600's popularity. They contributed many high quality games available for the early platforms. Xonox capitalized on the novelty and perceived value of \"double-ender\" cartridges. These could be inserted into the console on one of the two ends, each end offering a different game. Different double-ender configurations could package the same game with different counterparts. Xonox was not the first company to try this; Playaround did it earlier with their adult-themed titles. Xonox eventually abandoned this idea and began releasing single versions of some of the titles previously offered as double-enders as well as a few new titles.\nXonox was one of many small video game companies to fold during the Video Game Crash of 1983.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Xonox","Publisher":"Xonox","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"7f340007-5976-48ba-81a5-8a8db13e78b8.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"61d6c07b-2d7f-4ee4-833f-0dc1d30a812a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"9f203ca3-9d8d-4119-9aed-46706d1287df.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"b6f030db-743a-4a50-8ed8-35aedf9560ff.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"a31c64a6-9cee-4550-b546-d81550a1ad46.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"8448f908-b4a4-4d3c-946a-d59360177ce1.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"e3ffae3a-9162-4132-b9bb-d5720fd58d16.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"003a149e-cb29-4438-8c09-c7c62ea54d5a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"ac842054-806d-4ac8-aec1-d88876adf4d1.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"b5182bf2-c974-4bc5-af7b-d17e9fb08a3b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":19844,"FileName":"941a6740-e0aa-4080-a77f-e929d7321bcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128444,"Name":"Yahtzee","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"dd5552ad-e9fd-40bb-880b-9bb6f068824a.png","Type":"Banner","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"bb7afdc4-7bb6-42ee-95b1-fb193fecb5ca.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"6eb31a61-49f1-4878-8bde-c5de5026e633.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"a3b2c9ce-6799-432a-9f5c-10867767cef9.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"76dda384-83e9-4b93-a077-4392b05ec39d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"0c4f78d0-5000-4c27-afa1-6c48d466e086.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"0ac2126b-302d-4859-8d7e-a566b4c94216.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128444,"FileName":"2977b128-1329-44f8-b5c5-a6b5c474d6b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":128343,"Name":"Yars' Return","ReleaseYear":"2005","Overview":"A sequel to the original Yars' Revenge, released on the Atari Flashback 2.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/yQZumQxUxIc","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari, Inc.","Publisher":"Atari Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"4ce3f53b-75f8-4754-80d3-a502b1f5c3bb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"0dcc8199-5d4a-4c2d-b5f3-8e9a60cd1718.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"40895b5e-40f0-450d-89a7-86e47d4aaa80.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"6e8b843b-10c4-491a-846c-fc7655eea3b1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"c66f32d1-9234-439b-ac39-31c5ea87c7f3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"2d7155ea-d544-4509-a3d0-88ef74a0a676.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":128343,"FileName":"38b95024-6e80-467a-839b-e044b5d87061.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":3598,"Name":"Yars' Revenge","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"In Yars' Revenge, your goal is to destroy the Qotile laser-base which is located on the right side of the screen behind a shield.

Once the shield is down, you will need to use the Zorlon cannon to destroy the Qotile. The Zorlon cannon is located on the left side of the screen, and when fired can destroy the Qotile with a direct hit. The Qotile isn't completely unarmed against your attacks, however. Wandering around the screen is a destroyer missile, which will constantly be homing in on your Yar. This missile can not be destroyed, however you can temporarily hide from it in a shield which runs vertically in the center of the screen. The Yar will be unable to fire when hiding in the shield so you can't stay there indefinitely! The Qotiles second weapon is a swirl which it will randomly fire at you and should be dodged. When you finally destroy the Qotile you can move on to the next, faster round of gameplay. Several game variations are included which control the difficulty and speed of the game.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0cEdNRe98A","Platform":"Atari 2600","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1982-05-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"8151a4c1-2196-42dd-b589-3930c9ee18af.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"1d93fba8-eb3e-4f9b-bee2-b779b4dfb02c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"da4c8fbb-edc8-4f93-ba29-6eb1ff5e5826.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"ba105f98-c5a5-425b-9905-56dd946d8295.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"d866f506-1eca-46bd-a5bc-0f6c50b60b70.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"abd1f684-286a-424a-ac92-060b9b5abe80.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":3598,"FileName":"f433523e-ad56-4cb8-9632-64a01b18f32a.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":15077,"Name":"Zaxxon","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"This fantastic 3-dimensional space battle game puts you in control of a futuristic spaceship!
