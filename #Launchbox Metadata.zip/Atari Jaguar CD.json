{"Name":"Atari Jaguar CD","Games":[{"DatabaseID":5251,"Name":"Asteroids","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Asteroids is an arcade space shooter released in November 1979] by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.\n\nAsteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains and used hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for Lunar Lander. Based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos and inspired by Spacewar! and Computer Space, both early shoot 'em up video games, Asteroids '​ physics model and control scheme were derived by Logg from these earlier games and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes.\n\nAcclaimed by players and video game critics for its vector graphics, controls, and addictive gameplay, Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games. The game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. Asteroids was widely imitated and directly influenced two popular and often cloned arcade games, Defender and Gravitar, as well as many other video games.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari Jaguar CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sinister Developments","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"a39134ea-8b44-42c9-b39b-09e44dc5756c.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"2a9b1199-ebde-4905-8732-a8f31e895450.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"a72a1b7c-8b56-46d4-8f01-1fe4b268bd2f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"d6787638-b676-4499-a96b-c629661664fa.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"9ab4ff6e-a47e-4887-93ab-3c008eec8e61.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"d74a857a-57ab-4a93-93ba-081865f6e17c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5251,"FileName":"63a2c84d-4ff2-4bb2-94dc-62137f32f9d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5250,"Name":"Atomic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Similar to the famous ST Atomic which is both a mind game and also a tool to learn some basic knowledge of chemistry.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari Jaguar CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Education","Developer":"SebRmv","Publisher":"Public Domain/Freeware","ReleaseDate":"2006-02-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":5250,"FileName":"f18669e0-ed0f-4fd2-895a-98a848fe5bb7.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5250,"FileName":"5bb929b3-7ae0-483d-a281-b2e4bd711a6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":5250,"FileName":"2d70e7c6-2711-4108-90c7-6134ccd70f96.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5252,"Name":"Baldies","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Ever want to rule the world?

The level is a top-down view, with the player's ship and shield on one side and the aliens on the other side; this level bears the most resemblance to Space Invaders.\n\nThe second level called Laser Attack is made up of a formation of ships, with some that swoop down and a laser that fires at the player's ship. Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.\n\n\nThe third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.\n\n\nThe fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.\n\n\nThe fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.\n\nFinishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16TZa_-GW7o","Platform":"Atari Jaguar CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"3D Stooges Software","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2006-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":196059,"FileName":"ef90e47a-8763-4779-8b86-0337115d83f6.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":196059,"FileName":"964324c3-cc3d-49a6-8f0e-7d0926a55e4f.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":196059,"FileName":"0545faa5-01ca-40f6-b652-065713daaf40.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196059,"FileName":"848cc32a-62d8-4d93-9272-ab754ac1d9d4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196059,"FileName":"56b9a6ab-872e-4bd9-afee-3ea6fce2f06d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":5260,"Name":"Highlander: The Last of the MacLeods","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Quentin McCloud must rescue clan members during a journey across his world in this game for the Jaguar CD.

The first-person control scheme has promise, but suffers from multiple problems. If Quentin is attacked from behind, by the time he pivots, he's usually dead.
