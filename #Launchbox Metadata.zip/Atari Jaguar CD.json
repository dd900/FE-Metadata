The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy asteroids and saucers while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.\n\nAsteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains and used hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for Lunar Lander. Based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos and inspired by Spacewar! and Computer Space, both early shoot 'em up video games, Asteroids '​ physics model and control scheme were derived by Logg from these earlier games and refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around in both screen axes.\n\nAcclaimed by players and video game critics for its vector graphics, controls, and addictive gameplay, Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of arcade games. The game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved both popular with players and influential with developers. It has since been ported to multiple platforms. Asteroids was widely imitated and directly influenced two popular and often cloned arcade games, Defender[2] and Gravitar, as well as many other video games.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"5252":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Creative Edge","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"dc0af4c5-c948-4ae1-9e89-b4aa3f3e7a8b.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"71dc699f-a5e2-4f19-a18b-da14cc43314e.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9e430d42-002f-4506-9965-6b5212b352d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"46982768-8c3e-4f3f-bf6a-502f2dbff3f1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d1740a99-3cbb-473f-95ec-01b8683ec5f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6a686697-ac18-4baa-89df-efd6c0674179.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d7f04720-4a33-4ea3-9d32-1d3c50613ea6.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"02e55a18-82a2-4847-9d45-a7a82bcdc5e6.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Baldies","Overview":"Ever want to rule the world?

Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.","Publisher":"Sun soft","ReleaseDate":"1995-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iOJ6dOy13uM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Myst"},"5264":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Duranik","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"da872d20-2399-4ffb-bfa9-a69ef8078248.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"be646abd-4d3f-4428-abd2-657c3afbe3ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"308775c6-279b-47dc-a720-a12c37c5741a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6f6ac75b-02c6-4c62-97fb-4262327a5254.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"903ba5f7-01d8-40b4-b568-9090d257a81f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"29dcf82b-6202-436c-8486-cb9cce0a6dc8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Native","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8vofghW0DYM"},"5265":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"T - Teen","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"9ff9ab71-59dd-46b7-aa58-35a7ff346d09.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"190c3655-bf2b-42dc-bb75-8835fb8807f7.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"616da845-980b-4ec9-b31b-7ed3a8e4fcdf.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5158bb0e-39e2-4629-b06d-ef71e87210a4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"40aebffa-91e0-4569-b3f0-cccba2ac0abe.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"332885eb-d39c-4f2a-a19e-c368973bf98e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"118fb73d-5fbc-45c4-a4df-55bda01c1f8a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d4733f27-7f6c-4db4-a53c-18f1985a88cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"27569bc2-fbb1-42f9-9716-fc78c3d2e903.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2e2fda53-969e-41c0-a0b2-5c1478422aa8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"48c48f00-f6c7-4705-929a-090cf23a9ccc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"933fed8a-a518-4c78-a7c5-aabad6db89fa.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"19f5d8bd-f962-4c5a-903e-e7b99a012dec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"45528acb-8986-4e1a-8305-0f2b4ec61817.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Primal Rage","Overview":"Primal Rage is a one-on-one fighting game featuring dinosaurs and giant apes as the fighters.

The game is played by either a single player against the CPU or a second player. Each version of Frog Feast is graphically identical, but limitations in storage media have led to alteration or removal of some aspects, including music and sound.\n\nJaguar CD controversy\nThe Atari Jaguar CD version handled by Oldergames in 2007 met many difficulties in the first run, as all fifty numbered copies were defective. The way in which they handled the problem left fans of the system considering a class-action lawsuit against Oldergames, which may have led to the operation closing down shop.","Publisher":"Rastersoft","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2007},"171592":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Matthias Domin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4bea5bc4-62a3-45df-8f6a-8ea86fe7747a.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b5dc73ac-8e3e-4b81-b691-65c233207943.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7eb1e27e-a4af-4424-9301-abc14c1d0135.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e2a19876-b537-4e7c-a22a-f67fa8cc1538.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a18011cf-df94-4175-9676-474e3a1da901.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Disc"},{"FileName":"35738426-b52c-489c-b85b-acd239856643.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"37bb0146-de30-496d-88bd-669283dd993a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"55277bc3-9096-42b0-b167-00a97041592e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9b855b21-93d3-40fe-94bc-567e4dcbee45.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"JagMania","Overview":"A 3d Pac-Man homebrew game by Matthias Domin with a surprising leap forward in Pac-Man technology.

Bonus ships also tend to appear in this level.\n\n\nThe third level is called Galaxians, and as the name suggests it is very similar to the game Galaxian with ships constantly dive bombing the player's spaceship. This mission only appears in the Arcade version.\n\n\nThe fourth level called Space Warp, has the player entering hyperspace.. The viewpoint switches from a top-down view to a behind-the-ship view. One by one, alien vessels will come out and fly in a circular formation shooting at the player's ship with the players goal being to destroy each one.\n\n\nThe fifth and final level is called Flag Ship. In this level, the player does not fight a wave of enemies, but a single one which happens to be a large Flag Ship with a weak spot which is its core. Hitting the weak spot will instantly destroy it, but the player must first shoot through a similar shield that the player had in the first level.\n\nFinishing the game increases the player's rank and starts the game over at level 1 with a faster game speed for more challenge.","ReleaseDate":"2006-02-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=16TZa_-GW7o"},"196068":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Reboot","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9c9cb75a-102f-4831-a922-78e9e02f991b.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"800191cf-2888-4cfe-b302-1a0ef8e2a079.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c3e5476b-41e7-4cc4-b041-7f5d9ba1124c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"695a3b4b-4e0f-4cb6-801d-970502764ee9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e94cb1b1-a89d-4c4c-9292-cd5062fa72d8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Full Circle: Rocketeer","Overview":"\"Flying through space is no picnic. Commanding an intergalactic space vessel isn't all plaid blankets and wicker baskets. All manner of peculiar happenings might ruin one's day. Take planets for instance. They're big. Really big. Often rather solid, too. For these reasons alone, it's usually advisable not to involve yourself in any sort of altercation with one, particularly when travelling through hyperspace.\n\nThis was now something Space Corps Commander Gwyn Williams knew only too well, as, from his vantage point high in the upper atmosphere, he observed the fragments of his vessel scattered over the surface of this particular example of Big Solid Planet. Sliced into three sections with the ship's cargo falling from orbit all around him, he wondered how this day might possibly get any worse... Ah! Of course! An onslaught of deadly rocks - simply perfect!\" \n \nRebuild and reload your crashed space craft whilst fending off endless waves of hostile aliens and meteors in 16 unique levels spread over 4 worlds!
