The player moves his laser base across the bottom of the screen and has to shoot down the aliens that appear above him. What sets Astro Invader apart from other early shoot 'em ups is that the aliens, after being dropped from their mothership, position themselves in columns. Once a column is full the lowest alien drops down and suicide dives towards the player. As they hit the ground they explode and the player must make sure he is not within the blast radius. In addition to the standard aliens there are also UFOs that appear in the middle and to the sides of the screen. These must be shot down as they will kill the player when landing, no matter where the player is positioned. The game is over when all three lives are lost.\n\nThe Japanese version (Kamikaze) has some differences. Most noticeable is that it has more columns and that the UFOs only appear in the middle of the screen. It also has regular aliens that attack on the sides of the screen without going through the columns. Aliens that crash into the ground has a greater blast radius than in the US version.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z9xLl_pLII","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"UA Limited","Publisher":"Bandai Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125804,"FileName":"fa9dc58c-383a-40c1-a5c8-8074075e5336.png","Type":"Box -

As Climber scales a building, he is able to climb up and sideways but he cannot climb down. While climbing a building, windows will open and close simultaneously. If any window closes on either of his hands he will lose his grip. However, if a window closes on both of his hands, he will fall to his death, resulting in the loss of a life. You have three Climbers in total, but you are awarded an extra Climber every 30,000 points. Besides windows, Climber is faced with other dangers, including:\n\n    Bald-headed guys who hurl various objects at you.\n    Pesky condors who fly by, dropping eggs and droppings of an unpleasant substance.\n    Falling steel girders and iron dumbells.\n    Electrical \"Nichibutsu\" signs with a dangling live wire.\n    Falling \"Crazy Climber\" signs.\n    King Kong leaping from side to side of the building and slams his hands against the windows.\n\nThe climber must try to avoid or overcome each of those hazards which he will encounter as he continues climbing in his attempt to reach the rooftop. If he falls to his death by windows or objects, another climber will replace him and will start at the same location where the last one fell. The specific danger will not be present at the same point, so the climber can go further up to face the next danger. Most of the hazards are announced by certain recognizable musical themes.\n\nCrazy Climber is awarded a bonus score on each building every time after getting carried off by the helicopter. However, each bonus score will decrease by every ten seconds that the climber will spend scaling each building as he attempts reach the top. Somewhere in the game, there is \"The Lucky Balloon\", which can lift Climber about ten stories and raise the player's bonus score if he catches it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFUEVuo1yTI","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Nihon Bussan Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Grandstand Leisure Ltd","ReleaseDate":"1982-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"04d44f51-6354-430e-a317-e738c45cbaf2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"f8538f50-8f86-4a9c-8a39-b9eb0cb20669.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"2b044c4c-d88d-4272-8355-df8f00261906.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"cd52ddb0-50f0-4d0b-8dbd-7831e63c8c23.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"03042196-f4c0-4fff-b452-913980ecc44e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"397da6dd-b03f-4c36-81dc-9688567c8338.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126422,"FileName":"98173ce3-8a87-4c17-a474-3cc1667894a7.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126423,"Name":"Crazy Gobbler","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Crazy Gobbler is a clone of the Arcade game \"Pac-Man\" developed and published by Emerson Radio Corp., which was released in 1982.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YllhjHwJvQQ","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Emerson Radio Corp.","Publisher":"Emerson Radio Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1982-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"9bbae5a6-0a68-4e8b-9276-3470c969abbb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"a5be2d08-3455-4858-a94b-f9dd3c2e5250.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"89d3986b-2ae9-4849-b196-6ed58d78fa75.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"9d7a7311-42b1-493f-a03d-bb88205a2f14.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"5947a233-8292-4b3e-8b39-71e40d6b74d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"7af63299-fa91-4ec3-b47c-dddd302f8d63.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126423,"FileName":"810c0886-1673-4c88-aac8-abc05a1e212d.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126424,"Name":"Doraemon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Doraemon is a  Pac-Man style game, developed and published by Bandai, which was released in 1983 in Japan.

It is exclusive to the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001 that was only available in Japan.\n\nThe player controls protagonist Arale-chan, as she attempts to prevent the alien King Nikochan and his servant from building a UFO out of car parts. By yelling at the two aliens, she can knock the aliens down and retrieve the stolen car parts. Arale-chan frequently runs out of Robovita-A fuel, however, and must recharge with a teapot that appears periodically.\n\nOnce the aliens have successfully carried five car parts to the launching pad at the top of the screen, they will finish building their UFO and will attempt to fly away. If Arale-chan can hit them with her \"N'cha Cannon\" yell, they will crash, and the player will receive many bonus points.\n\nThe game features two modes. In Level 1, the characters move slowly, while Level 2 features a faster speed. The player has three lives and must try to score as many points as possible.

In the maze are three other such creatures and the aim of the game is to destroy the other creatures before getting killed by them. The enemies will appear in three different colors with different lengths. The red ones are longer than the player who will be killed upon a head-on collision. The yellow ones are the same length as the player and are harmless. The green ones are shorter than the player and can be killed by colliding with their heads. The enemies can be shot at and if one is hit in its tail its size will decrease by one segment. Creatures that are smaller will move faster and be harder to catch. At the same time it is possible to increase the player's size by eating fruits that appear at random locations but it decreases if hit by the enemy creatures' fire.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwJqNHv3AoI","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"UA Limited","Publisher":"Emerson Radio Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1982-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"b96ade5e-ef4d-40f2-8e79-6ed732dab97a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"c509d943-bf37-462b-bad6-77e9adec4bd9.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"5dc2793f-0344-44e0-bde6-f4a854a8ae2c.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"2de40d28-78d0-4d17-b5e2-eecf19c03063.PNG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"37a3a514-5b73-4ec9-9132-4c0a9500d9db.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"0f6aff33-a8f6-49b9-b359-cbb4a4973ce1.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126452,"FileName":"c53804dc-68c4-4e1e-aec3-81272c30a2c4.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126453,"Name":"Math Logic","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Math Logic is a quiz game, developed and published by Emerson Radio Corp., which was released in 1982.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Quiz","Developer":"Emerson Radio Corp.","Publisher":"Emerson Radio Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1982-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"2ee77242-9a7f-4548-b708-1fffd1eec31a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"b5062de1-3594-49be-9f8a-d1c3a31be485.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"1f68fad3-44eb-452a-ab5e-a095820efea9.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"427ff8fb-7124-4525-96ee-c23147c1e366.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"5b7d8e06-aff1-4d9d-8f40-972e2ca0ee8c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"e6f49a56-4c3d-40df-b2db-f36a70c417fa.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126453,"FileName":"f874758a-bfa6-4529-82c2-4eea7eae531f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126454,"Name":"Missile War","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Missile War is a shoot 'em up game, based on the arcade classic Missile Command.

The money bags either give the player 200 or 800 points, the oil spill temporarily slows the player's car down, the checkered flag will turn the tables, turning the opponents into money bags that the player can collect (similar to how the power pellet works in Pac-Man), and bombs will explode the car. After every item is collected, the player moves on to the next stage.\n\nWhen a specific route is entered, the view is switched to a single screen maze. The mazes contain dead-ends, obstacles, and many exits, with the risk of the player's car getting hit by the other cars.\n\nThe player can speed up his/her car, but this causes the fuel to decrease faster than racing at the usual speed. If fuel runs out, the player loses a life, and when the stage is completed, the remaining amount of fuel gets added to the player's score.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3HV7vG_quA&t=61s","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Tehkan Ltd.","Publisher":"Centuri","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"789f24f8-87be-44d4-bf4b-9094ccecf574.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"19da0753-e1b9-45fd-8d49-0337104c7255.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"4937369d-f8b4-45ed-afff-ed04bc20eece.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"2fc408b0-ed2f-415c-a679-fe862716f8f6.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"ba823bb6-4345-4a99-a4df-a2d923f6451f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"0f105f55-4c5b-4e4b-8a9f-17029c146f7f.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"8bb28c74-5e69-42f3-ba62-881b89b4dc6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125803,"FileName":"d3ff798b-cddb-4676-be65-955f22ab1d3b.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126464,"Name":"Soccer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Soccer is a sports game, developed and published by Emerson Radio Corp., which was released in 1982.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyD25cZ1qU0","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Emerson Radio Corp.","Publisher":"Emerson Radio Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1982-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"c6eaae6d-2b93-4856-ab3f-798f9bb3d51a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"b3fae0da-1637-436d-bb49-cdd3bcccaef5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"636d0dd2-2f14-48ce-ae72-2c95f2746e5c.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"34592240-e5e9-4e37-bff1-8def4bd2640e.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"5619a5e2-4b3b-4b28-98b0-e35c240bb939.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"91c647dc-9b92-4303-9377-6c67075441fb.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126464,"FileName":"1ac2a316-ae78-4008-ab9a-a0f368927caf.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126466,"Name":"Space Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Space Attack is a clone of the Arcade game \"Galaxian\" developed and published by Emerson Radio Corp., which was released in 1982.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zenRM5gdwIA","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"UA Limited","Publisher":"Emerson Radio Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1982-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"a0dc9033-4e60-4688-93b8-121c741ded9d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"7125dfef-1fef-440c-b3b3-b061b33bea0e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"0e214fb3-66a7-4083-9d75-d579357870d4.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"b6abd505-59a1-4b1d-9147-bceb41da1f83.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"89a993e7-3168-443c-9e47-e22187926fca.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"e0f69bd0-2ef2-45f3-929d-f2fe631c6fe8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"8be036af-7826-43b5-9742-3dec44cdc4dd.png","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"8850afc0-45c1-42bf-b6e2-35bf92461ebd.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126466,"FileName":"3e588382-cfd2-4b40-bf00-24aa0b355c24.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126467,"Name":"Space Chess","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Space Chess (also called Star Chess) is a game of chess for two players.

It takes place in a Pacman-esque labyrinth, with turtle boxes in the center and corners of the screen. Run into a box to release the turtle kid inside. Opening a box makes a little house show up, and you must go with the kid turtle to the house before you can release the next one. All the while, you must avoid the bugs/cars running around the maze. If they get too close, you can release a mine which will stun them temporarily. When you run out of mines, you must resupply by passing over a star in the center of the screen. Beware, though, because the simpleminded bugs become smarter as time passes; this is symbolized by their changing colors. On later levels, those sneaky beetles can also come out of the boxes supposed to hold kid turtles. Watch out!\n\nEach level is a floor in a house, and between levels you can see the turtle climbing to the next floor until it reaches the top. However, in the Philips versions, the kid turtles are replaced by people whom the turtle must save from ships, while the bugs are turned into turtle-eating fish.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgyioUT3H2w&t=20s","Platform":"Emerson Arcadia 2001","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"UA Limited","Publisher":"Hanimex","ReleaseDate":"1983-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"68eb5ba7-dec3-4e21-ae42-103836df58e2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"50698ba5-d76b-494a-9e4b-3d309700f3c2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"07da9eca-374b-4b54-b2b0-9db11ddc32d3.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"8e3047ce-120f-498e-82bb-7cc4a644656f.PNG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"c64b94e6-9cf3-434f-bc87-7fd06c1014b8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"38251eab-b237-49fa-89bb-1c7a30c8a890.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126478,"FileName":"f4e21ebd-75fc-48ea-82bb-9a58ba416222.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":126478,"AlternateName":"Turpin","Region":null}]}]}
