Alien Breed consists of the player or players having to find the lift down to the next level, occasionally setting the self-destruct sequence to blow up the level above them. The players collect or purchase a variety of weapons from the space station's computer terminals. In some versions of the game, these so-called Intex terminals provide additional features such as a clone of the classic computer game Pong. Credits found on the ground have to be saved for these weapons and other enhancements, each giving the players an edge over the gradually more and more powerful Alien forces. In advanced levels, players are occasionally trapped in enclosed spaces with huge \"boss\" aliens, reminiscent of the Alien Queen.\n\nQwak:\nThe object of the game is to guide a green duck through eighty levels. Fruit and gems can be collected for points, and enemies are eliminated with projectile egg weapons. Progress through the game is earned by collecting gold and silver keys. There are a variety of power-ups also available, including 'chocolate egg' weapons and extra shots. In addition to the normal-style levels, the challenge levels require the player to complete levels and collect all fruit within twenty seconds. Upon completion of all eighty levels, the levels are looped.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Team 17","Publisher":"Team 17","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"e10d89fd-3572-48b7-9a5a-ef82d98178a5.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"ad47af5c-e8eb-4ab3-87f3-39f1a8aa676d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"f41a3a63-576c-4efd-8a89-5f8750d7186f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"1bba4529-1266-42d2-af23-cecdffb4ff36.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"69f92b00-e19d-46dd-885a-b549dca42249.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"324ee7a1-d7cf-4fed-ad0a-1658f9246263.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"61ffb6d2-1389-4cf9-9e1d-77348a523fd4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"8476f4a8-cc1d-4d11-a48b-339b58487ee9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"8fbabefa-e65b-4c82-b8d0-7582e9189038.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92892,"FileName":"122c0e8e-e0c7-4ca6-af37-6876c26e6859.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90573,"Name":"Alien Breed: Tower Assault","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"A scientific outpost on a far off planet has been attacked.

Your soldier shoots his way through the levels, collecting keys, ammunition and credits along the way. Computers can be logged into to buy new weapons. A new 'retreat' mode allows you to fire while moving backwards.\n\nThe game is largely non-linear, as most levels have multiple exits, and the game can be moved through in different ways. There is a variety of indoor and outdoor levels, although you spend most time inside some of the multi-level towers.

Unfortunately, the previous number one group, The Rappin' Rabbit Rockers, are very angry at the Beavers success. They put a plan into action. Jethro's wife was kidnapped and is being held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and all their master tapes are destroyed. Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. He sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the help of his children.\nYou take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.\nIf fighting is not enough, you must collect Charisma Stars to maintain your charisma that you will need to complete a level. There are also Life Stars which have the ability to give you another life, but to get these, you must sneak up on them or the will move out of your reach. To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas. Just try jumping on them. Sometimes to reach the top of a level, clouds may have to be used. Some are more solid than the others. Mushroom Seeds can be used to grow your own platform to access other platforms. You may come across machinery that activate lifts or send a jet of steam into the air. You will need a spanner to start these up.

Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into the goal, kept by a net-minder. The oval ball can be thrown or kicked, this resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks.\nViolence is the pivotal element of gameplay: rather than rare occurrency, punching, stomping, use of weapons, and even decapitations are what the game action is rife with, and key to victory. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises which slow him down.\nTeams are a total of eleven and consist of seven humans and aliens, some of whom have unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. Victory is achieved not only by scoring more goals than the opponent team but also decapitating all the players of it but one. The player is offered choice among a single match, knockout cup, and leagues to advance trough (for a total of four of them).","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbGzZeeZJvY&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Teque London Ltd.","Publisher":"Millenium Interactive","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"fe1e2a68-4f21-4de2-931d-8a2d6bde5cbe.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"de82959f-aa71-4c67-b775-9cda76990b72.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"2b9d0a01-6abb-4639-b3b5-3215f21b3d9b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"d8b1c5cc-bdff-40dc-8c9c-8f65bed8c235.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"220879e9-a9fe-4068-8a80-b838164fb55d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"d758bf68-4d4d-4cb8-956c-a33b0819b1f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"e860543e-ee45-42bc-bcfe-abcf895204ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122535,"FileName":"3e6a8a9c-9c6c-406e-82e1-a4b157741a8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122536,"Name":"Brutal: Paws of Fury","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"The Dalai Llama has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself.\nBrutal: Paws of Fury is a one-on-one fighting game across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown.\nDuring a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a \"taunt\" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0W0znAqjoQ&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Software Sorcery","Publisher":"GameTek UK Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"41adcfb3-07e8-4604-a2da-1bcbf69ed7e2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"cb1c87aa-1b29-41cc-a24f-f5c8edd23ac5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"483085d0-bb24-4f48-a7a6-83dfa6d22c1f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"443ede29-1465-4865-aa55-d24abf5ae689.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"65060b69-b169-41e4-9cd4-dfc59121c9d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"542bfc1e-5011-4446-9c47-afe21aeeafc7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"90447b65-80e6-47ff-aed8-14629ae7b269.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"cbf40240-983b-450a-8bdd-31bd1360f5c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"54aea180-e1a5-4194-a6d1-d42e39fab4ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122536,"FileName":"61a0615d-cbec-48b7-af32-4066623e3ec1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":91968,"Name":"Bubba 'n' Stix","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"The player controls Bubba, a redneck character, who is accompanied by a sentient stick named Stix.

So, Chuck is rather upset about this whole situation and you have to help him make things right.\nThe game is a side-scrolling platformer. Chuck fights of a variety of dinosaurs using his belly-buster attack and a jump kick. Occasionally he has to pick up and throw rocks to defeat enemies and allow him to jump to greater heights.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25UNNRnjCjo","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Core Design","Publisher":"Core Design","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"b3df16b2-9a24-4e02-8f09-c8ee36576cf3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"df2a9892-b3ce-482e-a1bf-f5411e5f9d0f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"3ca113bc-161e-4631-97a2-79abd29da277.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"826cd607-0b8b-458c-b733-1af87e36a4cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"a9f24af3-f7ea-480a-b46f-09fb447cc34b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"1571e09f-2a7c-4196-a073-bf22a26c65cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"d3e6bfa1-7996-4d7b-8d55-196b24b77098.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"a05c3554-b95d-4282-8ca8-0f4ea33979c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"03ca6aa4-404f-465e-86e3-cae996b05f6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":20262,"FileName":"46c32dd6-7480-484a-9196-05b65a6a06f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":16901,"Name":"Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game. As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter. Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!\nThe gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRRwJMpr450","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Core Design","Publisher":"Core Design","ReleaseDate":"1994-09-15T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"9006602a-b9cc-4824-9575-870a5cd8a609.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"6a155118-f00c-419e-825c-5b1387beb48a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"b6fd7d40-eeec-42e0-9305-ab5cf16ffc94.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"92eecc41-f06d-44b9-914e-d0134db7d017.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"ae39ae8e-5b44-4d84-bee0-d367c2d36cec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"d05ddc6f-2e90-4677-abca-37848acfa314.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"09c45404-0000-42ae-9a13-86be2933d2b3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"7f220c99-394b-4fa0-a147-8a1e89446b06.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"c93f3d7d-20e8-4ac3-8674-317a2c48fda7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"5204926e-8b2c-4e56-9655-21c41fdffd8d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":16901,"FileName":"cc3865f7-b2a6-431f-96eb-9ad56d8d6da0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122679,"Name":"Clockwiser","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"On each of Clockwiser's levels, you are presented with a level layout, and a target layout, with the aim being to transform the former to match the target.

Finally, surviving Genoq employees and some special items are scattered around the floors. Rescuing a survivor by clearing a room of bioweapons and getting him/her to its entry point in one piece earns an extra life. Bombs are the most prominent item; they can blast through doors and destroy some hazards, making them a kind of a \"get out of puzzle free\" coupon.\n\nThe number of lives is limited. Losing one restarts the room if any are left, the floor if not. Saving is available, loading returns to the start of the floor.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOvlCFvtuZY","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"The Software Toolworks","Publisher":"Mindscape","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"6363975e-e119-4d0a-91a7-4a324c9d2caf.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"646b411b-a891-4614-b6a7-9b25e6eca6ce.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"98fe790d-6441-4717-81e1-988674424080.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"84a5b4db-945b-4287-839d-4ae1da6bc4a2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"03a8a211-8b5a-4c7f-af04-c760e2c22d76.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"cf613805-055b-4bc5-82df-4f5c3b36dc7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"ca15a8cd-07c4-4dd3-96de-e1388a216d8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92156,"FileName":"1874ff19-83ec-4e08-9b7a-a32da39f022d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10185,"Name":"Dangerous Streets","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Dangerous Streets is a colorful sprite-based fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter II.

Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.\n\nIn one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons.

Of course the nobles of the land aren't willing to give up their wealth, so this money must be obtained through tournaments, raids and outright battle against individual provinces. All of the nobles have castles, so at times siege equipment must be used.\n\nDefender of the Crown II is the sequel to the smash hit Defender of the Crown. It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button. The siege sequence is also enhanced with different types of ammo (such as Greek fire) to toss into the castle. The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Sachs Enterprises","Publisher":"Commodore","ReleaseDate":"1995-03-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"46b31fa1-1817-451f-98c4-3539959df7b4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"a01c0763-292c-4cfd-8786-ceaf352894b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"1be34b00-04f0-484f-8bb8-b40883f0a2bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"68477c3d-071d-40ff-9670-00f21880b02b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"65280c81-7292-4f9e-9db5-0037db5850a4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"968b70d4-5d16-4277-857e-329caa9af6e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"8ded46eb-a2f4-47ed-814c-159c421d7838.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90667,"FileName":"dc2df50b-4432-428b-9d3f-6dd2b7fd11bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":140430,"Name":"Dennis","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Dennis the Menace (known simply as Dennis in Europe) is a multiplatform video game based on the 1993 movie of the same name.

Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.\n\nUnofficial CD32 version Features:\n\nPsygore's WHDLoad slave with CD32 joypad support, speed corrected cutscenes and level/difficult select capability.\nControls screen.\nLevel and difficulty selection screen.\nMultiple language support - English, German, Czech, Italian and French.\nNEW: CDXL intro, derived from the 2013 remake - now redone in HAM8.\nNEW: Support for FastRAM equipped CD32's (eg TerribleFire)","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Unlicensed","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Delphine Software International","Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":"2018-07-23T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":190349,"FileName":"97394fa7-1b58-4a70-9402-59ecf6b2372f.png","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190349,"FileName":"cd128244-ea3c-484f-b0ff-92bd19837837.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190349,"FileName":"a2d144da-2d95-4ca3-8160-eb542e774454.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190349,"FileName":"bf8a0ba7-0f2d-4f04-8117-f19a9695e457.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190349,"FileName":"f8b1dee1-10b7-440d-9021-365599109dc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190349,"FileName":"e5c72ee2-e2d9-4704-bd0d-946dd0e891b9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10200,"Name":"Flink","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Disaster strikes Imagica Island and Wicked Wainwright's taken over!

There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.\n\nThe game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pFaiRDu3wc","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Starbyte","Publisher":"Krisalis","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"e878960a-3a70-497f-96bb-48619fca5317.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"358f82ac-b4a9-440f-858d-f466e531ffe3.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"413a7c30-edd0-4e28-bb5d-70296ad4b44a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"8c319d24-3f0f-4f9e-9620-c5dead73b19b.png","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"879ebfd4-4bc2-484a-932f-a67e7067232a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"f83b4960-def7-42d3-bdc8-5fee2b0240ef.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"547a4c83-99b2-4a92-9d37-a369d2245a01.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"5be40961-9359-48e0-b52f-d82f56cbfb2c.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"8da3f251-2d85-4374-83ee-3da29a986b1c.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"9575b1d0-42bf-4077-bcf1-0cb2af359dc1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"fad0231a-b2bc-45ce-be88-73ffa4f78da9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"c26813e6-8b5a-4c23-9cd9-2ad68f71318f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"ded4b8a5-18e1-47ac-b155-fcba362c0bac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126219,"FileName":"be8eaac9-f035-4efc-adee-0016a09c8f75.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93504,"Name":"Frontier: Elite II","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"There is no plot within Frontier, nor are there pre-scripted missions (as there are in its sequel, First Encounters). Instead, players explore space while trading legally or illegally, carrying out missions for the military, ferrying passengers from system to system, engaging in piracy or any combination of the above. As a consequence, Frontier cannot be completed or \"won\", and players instead decide what to aspire to and set out to achieve it.\n\nIn Frontier, the player begins in the year 3200 and assumes the role of one of Commander Jameson's grandchildren, having inherited one hundred credits and an Eagle Long Range Fighter from him. By the game’s standards, these are very modest resources, and are intended as a spur to encourage players to earn money by whatever means they feel is appropriate.\n\nThough the plot is minimal, some background information about the universe of Frontier is provided. There are two major factions in the galaxy: The \"Federation\", based in the Sol system, and the \"Empire\", based in the Achenar system. These two factions are bitter enemies, but at the time of the game they have established a tense cease-fire, akin to the Cold War. Players are free to side themselves with the Federation, the Empire, both, or neither; the game does not restrict one's political career. Both sides have military forces that a player can run freelance missions for, with successes leading to a military promotion. The ranks of the Federation and Empire are independent of each other. Playing for both sides adds to the difficulty to acquire a rank promotion for either.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvrFRAkxz7w","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Flight Simulator","Developer":"Frontier Developments","Publisher":"GameTek","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":93504,"FileName":"106a4b42-6bf9-4b06-a709-c3915385531c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93504,"FileName":"cfbc05d9-524d-43f1-baf1-1e655bc1aec1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93504,"FileName":"3ba187ea-cd2f-40db-bd92-13b04790ac5c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93504,"FileName":"80149cf7-b372-45dc-acbf-9dbad1deab7b.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93504,"FileName":"f2211f2f-b690-4762-9a44-6b2de573f279.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":121930,"Name":"Fury of the Furries","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"In Fury of the Furries, you control a cute, round creature called Tiny, who must defeat \"the wicked one\" who has captured the King, and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters.

Most people will find Gulp! incredibly hard to play for the first hour or two, simply because there is so much to watch out for, and so much going on at once. Thankfully, you are able to pause the game and scroll around the map, so you shouldn’t find it too much trouble planning your route; it’s just the execution that’s the hard part.\n\nGulp! isn’t a bad game at all. Although it sometimes can get very confused on screen, there are some really nice ideas in there. It won’t hook everyone In fact. I don’t even think it will hook everyone who liked Lemmings. You’ll either love it with a passion, or you’ll play it once and never look at it again. It’s a time-honoured statement, but I think with this one you’re really going to have to try before you buy.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYC0WR-UcNA&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"I.C.E.","Publisher":"I.C.E.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"35d680f4-1583-4f19-8773-bbc682aef60e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"e4c48b03-24c6-4f6b-909b-52e5e1452987.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"f539d6ff-6381-4877-afab-408323334606.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"15750e8e-3039-4b20-9989-0aec1016d6ac.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"b46afcbe-23dd-4e26-a486-c7b76f9c44da.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"40df3ab9-62dc-48f8-830e-1ea9be0dd681.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"a12a2f3e-a89f-4a05-8200-53883f15f776.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138003,"FileName":"b74775af-bf3b-47f9-9e3f-d7d5a76e810a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":126203,"Name":"Gunship 2000","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Take the Apache, the new Longbow Apache, The Blackhawk, Comanche Scout, Comanche Gunship, or the MD-500 Defender on campaigns or missions.

I can well remember countless days and nights spent searching rooms in a secret underground bunker, looking for the missing parts of a puzzle that would allow me to enter the hidden room and kill the mad professor who is trying to take over the world. \"Destroy him my robots,\" cried the voice of said sanity-challenged intellectual.\n\nThe presentation has been updated, but the actual game remains much the same. You have to search every object in each location for the parts of a puzzle, which must be solved to open the exit for the location. As items are searched, various other objects can be found, such as single shot guns, jetpacks, mines and all manner of other toys and freebies. So what improvements have been made over the original? Well, you now have three different characters to choose from instead of the original one. The rooms have been broken down into levels and expanded to a hundred times their original size.\n\nAfter playing the game for a few nights, I have to admit I feel a little disappointed. By trying to combine a puzzle game with a platform title, MicroProse seems to have fallen between two stools. This game just doesn’t have the charm or excitement of the original, but perhaps fond memories have clouded my view. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, this isn’t a bad game, it just gets tedious after a few goes.

I don’t really want to go into gross detail about the elements of International Open Golf as it’s already depressed me beyond belief and I wouldn’t wish the same fate upon you. Briefly though, have a look at the following example.\n\nI’m 50 yards away from the green. The ideal club is a Sand Wedge. Unfortunately due to the strange control method of only being able to take full power, half power, three-quarter power or one-quarter power shots (with nothing in between), the only way I can actually take a 50 yard shot is to change to a Number 2 iron and take a quarter shot. About as realistic as England’s chances of qualifying for the World Cup (wrong sport I know, but I feel strongly about both).\n\nInternational Open Golf is simply a failed attempt to do something different with the golfing concept. All credit to Ocean for trying but let’s face it, it was a doomed effort from the start. There’s only one way you stand a chance of bettering PGA Tour Golf and that’s to call your game MicroProse Golf (and I’ll bet that’s angered a few of you PGA purists out there).","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2Z9CVwvxnM&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"RISC","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138006,"FileName":"f02e1e8b-a15c-46fd-836a-8d08650b6f69.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":138006,"FileName":"46deb160-7126-49a0-8bcc-54a04eefdf87.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138006,"FileName":"c174b1ad-4506-4f60-9ada-f9cef2773cc7.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":138006,"FileName":"6be481ac-d1ca-4217-af07-324baa83ccf0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138006,"FileName":"b2a0e350-4f75-429b-a99a-11ccff7bce3f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138006,"FileName":"71506c16-4bc7-4ca6-bd7d-784615302413.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138059,"Name":"International Sensible Soccer: World Champions","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Released alongside the 1994 World Cup, this was the first version of Sensible Soccer to feature teams from outside Europe.

The map of the Moon consists of many levels connected with pathways. The levels are grouped into themed sections including cheese, custard, ice cream and more, with each section culminating in a boss fight. Many stage names are a play on words, such as \"The Garden of Edam\" for the first level (named after the Garden of Eden). A unique twist to the standard \"Super Mario\"-style gameplay is that Pond's magno-boots allow him to run up walls. Once on a ceiling, Pond will only fall down if he jumps off, and some levels have sections which the player must navigate in this upside-down fashion. Although Pond can no longer stretch his body upwards as he could in the preceding game, many levels give the player gadgets that allow Pond to travel a great distance upwards.\n\nPond can run, jump and punch as standard. He can also use a wide array of items that he encounters, such as spring shoes, fruit guns and dynamite. By finding a special icon, players can play as his partner, Finnius the frog, as long as he has been rescued in a certain level. A cheat code allows the player to play as Finnius in all levels. Finnius can bounce repeatedly on his belly to jump increasingly high in the air, but cannot use any gadgets except for chattering teeth.\n\nThe goal of each level is to find one of its communication beacons and break it. Some levels have beacons that will not activate until four colored teacups are found and collected by the player. Many levels have a hidden pickup that will reveal a secret route once the level is completed, in a similar fashion to the secret exits in Super Mario World. Finding at least some of the secret levels is essential to finishing the game successfully. The player is informed that they need to destroy all of Dr Maybe's Cheese Mines, but this will not give the full ending once the final level is beaten. Certain levels contain \"Stiltonium\" extractors that Dr Maybe is using to produce a superweapon - these need to be destroyed in addition to the cheese mines to in order to finish the game completely.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4T_sk-9z0","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Vectordean Ltd","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"85f7b682-7817-4848-9e0f-148200e74f27.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"5dea8fe9-fce7-4882-8ae8-62b603dc6505.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"e852728d-083e-428a-b0fd-2f21a07549aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"944affd5-cb72-40db-be07-90ffc2d0c853.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"840496ea-73fa-4395-9722-413d792a7f3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"fe2a57ba-1878-4fcc-8a11-c832c60f7068.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"ddb17614-c51c-4e1e-8b47-3e1f256ffc16.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"26893d47-959a-4331-a2a2-ea9737cf118c.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"4fc129b3-72b0-44f5-975e-72e437d7b71f.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"136d45ce-6bfb-4858-b50f-3efad28b7fb6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"d6e0fa3b-55b6-4f70-b862-9320476bd5f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"79aea921-13ef-45cf-83f6-36f401197fb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92918,"FileName":"10f10e77-cd39-41e9-9582-9f4d10fe5e20.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":92918,"AlternateName":"James Pond 3: Operation Starfi5h","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":135578,"Name":"Jetstrike CD32","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"In Jetstrike you must stop the devious SPUDD forces by attacking them with your \"borrowed\" aircraft.

Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.\n\nKid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.\n\nThere are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets.\n\nOnce he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These \"extras\" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAjF8c_qyWI&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Magnetic Fields","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":134563,"FileName":"8f020487-aaac-4353-86c3-bead5e2cca77.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134563,"FileName":"2c813b68-79d1-45ee-8d56-de254fc25ec2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":134563,"FileName":"2619f114-6c1f-494b-a616-7b60f7e5c4f1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":134563,"FileName":"22f7a4de-fdf4-4896-a39a-a1dfbcd3509d.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134563,"FileName":"e98b1563-87a9-4979-bb7f-e0dcdda82df4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134563,"FileName":"136f6b36-f0b6-4b02-9509-4f1eecaa5310.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138049,"Name":"Kingpin: Arcade Sports Bowling","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Kingpin: Arcade Sports Bowling is a bowling game with support for up to 6 players, who can be human or CPU-controlled.

The changing of the tires is mandatory on pit road during the middle of each race, and weather can determine whether the player should use hard tires, soft tires, or rain tires. Before the beginning of the race, it is possible to change some aspects of the car, such as spoilers, tires and gearbox.\n\nBeing licensed by Nigel Mansell, the game followed the 1992 Formula One season, which he won. The player takes on Mansell's role to try to win the title against eleven other real-life drivers that were still active in their careers by the time the game was launched. Like Sega's own Super Monaco GP, each of them belongs to their own team (instead of the common F1 format of two drivers per constructor). Although all the rival cars' colors resemble the actual constructors' colors by that time, only Mansell character wears a suit in the same color of his team's — blue. Mansell is also the only character to have his own sprite, distinguished by his signature mustache and cap. All the other drivers are shown with a similar sprite, all of them in yellow racing suits.\n\nThe player also has the option to change Mansell character by setting a different name and nationality. The countries available on custom mode are South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Spain, Finland, Monaco, Canada, France, Great Britain, Germany, Hungary, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Japan, Australia, Austria and United States. However, the playable character's appearance will remain that of Mansell. The game also features the national anthem for each of these countries, played in the podium whenever the player character wins a race. If a rival wins the race but the player finishes as runner-up or third place, the podium will still be shown, but the anthem to be played will be the one of the winning driver's home country.

The player takes the role of the chosen hero and boards their flying saucer to eliminate the aliens called Sirians. The game is a horizontal scrolling shooter. After a wave of enemies is destroyed, they release a power-up token. Collecting it will advance the weapon select gauge by one step, similar to Gradius. In this way, the weapon systems of the player's ship can be upgraded. If the player hits an enemy or a bullet, their energy bar is reduced. At the end of each level, a guardian awaits that needs to be destroyed in order to advance further in the game.\n\nBoth games can be played in NTSC, though Overkill has humans at the bottom of the screen that are difficult to see unless playing in PAL resolution. Overkill will also have some graphical glitches in NTSC, but they're relatively minor.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axS8ojtYQMA","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Vision","Publisher":"Mindscape","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":93506,"FileName":"fe80fcb2-f313-4774-ad10-f2f15c75e59e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93506,"FileName":"a87e6d4c-54c6-4e79-933f-a356ac809b66.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93506,"FileName":"27abce99-2d72-4bfa-a249-556d7c606092.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93506,"FileName":"4f726178-1efd-4905-ad4d-fe094a54c8a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93506,"FileName":"799d707f-8971-4775-9ca8-081e4f8d44f0.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":93506,"FileName":"74e63b25-fc04-44bb-8d98-63823bb3458b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":93507,"Name":"PGA European Tour","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such.

The player controls the ECO32-5 Cyborg and must fight all the other robots in the plant until finally meeting the Supervisor Droid.

The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dyr3U5fJjlM","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Krisalis","Publisher":"Krisalis","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"7552c231-a3e6-4838-90ba-5cd7f08ba72a.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"21b178d6-7f3b-4cfb-97ab-2217fc7a79c2.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"a1fdd43a-d1ce-406d-b1f5-5b8e79925cb2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"e84ab1f3-0210-4b70-9297-c6946c480794.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"2adefd1d-aecf-4141-9d68-18360f6bdbac.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"48ddd778-4bf9-4cb9-82d0-26538729edf8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"79d793c2-4317-4241-b425-63353a5bcc98.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"e3e576e1-1d83-4c0c-9474-61818eecafd3.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"9ec77ce7-1a06-4c78-b91a-41f11a6d68d9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"3809075e-702a-4179-aafb-5d021aef9e33.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"7ad03e67-298c-4079-aa90-1cbeba06d58b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"74136bdc-d86c-434a-8e7d-2f105f3dd22b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"2ba0b6a3-dec7-466d-8a36-cd16675cd669.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":126206,"FileName":"e9940ac5-ba6f-42ac-a3b4-f202b2b7d0b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":95523,"Name":"Seek & Destroy","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Seek and Destroy is a 1996 action video game developed by Vision Software and published by Safari Software (then a division of Epic MegaGames).

As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.\n\nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the game-play is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.\n\nThe sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half.

Subsequently sulking by the \"River O' Despair\", the prince chances upon a floating bottle of Lucozade which confers upon him super powers.\n\nThe objective of the game is to find and defeat the witch, thus rescuing your princess, whilst achieving smaller objectives throughout the game, such as finding a golden key or escaping from captivity in a circus.\n\nThere are 24 regular levels, divided into six differently-themed worlds. The goal of each level is to collect a set number of coins, and then reach the exit, which will only open if Superfrog has collected enough coins. Extra factors of gameplay include a timer countdown and a number of health points, both of which can be restored by finding bottles of Lucozade among the levels.\n\nDepending on the number of coins and fruit collected, and on how fast the player finishes the level, a number of credits (up to a maximum of 15) are awarded at the end of each level. The player can then choose to either collect the credits for a score or gamble them in a slot machine-style minigame for more bonuses. The most important function of the slot machine minigame is the chance to win a level code, enabling the player to restart the game from the beginning of the next level at a later time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Lqu7jlbccI&gl=BE","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Team 17","Publisher":"Team 17","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"afe969a6-4d50-422b-82d8-e8fb0582b5f7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"e0490c9d-346c-425b-b710-c5ad38ad917f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"d8d5dc91-ced3-4531-9f8d-5b16d2822b2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"3bb50e0c-7d8c-443b-820f-f6c8aed680f0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"44b3f165-3e0a-40c3-b6c0-8bb0cf6b3a87.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"532eac28-a0db-47f9-904a-bb19229041ed.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"8f31de72-f7d7-4916-bbac-75a7e6ee7372.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"f4645ad9-d89f-402d-9bf5-5ce45af30abf.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"95c076fb-3f78-4482-9223-4923958c7a00.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"26d4086c-cd43-4828-889e-f53c404b1567.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"82e6427e-2f7e-4d61-a04c-c49b87776213.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"c61fbfa6-5205-4f88-9013-081ca0078ce3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"3a7cb275-9b2d-4937-a3be-e327301aa0a8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":125464,"FileName":"c0d4019c-b279-42b9-9d41-575b95c970ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138001,"Name":"Surf Ninjas","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Surf Ninjas is based on the 1993 movie of the same title.

With the help of this knowledge, Fortesque managed to construct an immensely complex artificial intelligence known as the Chaos Engine. However, creation rebelled against its creator, assimilated its mind, and turned Britain into a war zone populated by mad machines. Mercenaries are willing to enter this dangerous place and put an end to the chaos, hoping for an appropriate reward.\nChaos Engine (Soldiers of Fortune in the US) is a run-and-gun overhead shooter. Sixteen levels (in four groups of four) await the players in the game. The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and other features in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style Bitmap Brothers appeared to favor.\nThere are six characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In two-player mode each player chooses a character and plays co-operatively, but in one-player games the player also chooses a character for the computer to control, with its artificial intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on enemies away from the ones occupying the player-controlled character.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uVxtVA6XTY","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"The Bitmap Brothers","Publisher":"Renegade","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"87672deb-cbc9-4f6f-be4f-1480d4e501a2.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"6451b0c9-94d1-4f98-9761-8106ff16c3cc.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"c6bcec16-6d42-4daf-9b51-e27280580120.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"f7be0d50-9b6c-4d23-85e3-1150c14cc696.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"45ece59c-20e4-455c-b49e-c69abd00498e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"70f038e9-b7ac-40b3-8300-6a9ea3fdd816.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"f1dac098-1747-4616-b55b-e105681bcde7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"f9333304-1b54-4953-820d-349c6a5225f5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"2baacd9a-e4d9-4e21-94ce-e03650fc5a8a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90445,"FileName":"31ce6ce4-268d-4df5-a31c-7bb27cc2ab7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90484,"Name":"The Clue!","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"You play Matt Stuvysant, a man of Polish descent and criminal persuasion.

The game begins during player's commute home from work. While aboard the subway, the player and their train car are suddenly sucked into an alternate dimension. An illusion in the form of the mythological character Daedalus explains that King Minos has forced him to oversee the construction of a labyrinth that spans the space-time continuum. Upon its construction, King Minos will invade and conquer all times and places with his supernatural powers. Daedalus pleads for the player to find a way to destroy the labyrinth before Minos can complete his conquest.[5]\n\nIn-game terminals and journal entries reveal the extent of Minos's power. As explained by the lone archivist on a lunar library, a figure identifying himself as the king appeared simultaneously to all world governments in all time periods, seizing control of their militaries and erasing all written history. Minos's new abilities seem to extend beyond time travel; the scene of the king's tomb strongly implies that he rose from the grave.\n\nThe labyrinth that the player explores spans many time periods and locations. Despite their incongruity, each area is thematically connected by the story of Martin Garret, a professor intrigued with discovering the tomb of the unnamed Sorcerer-King at a far-off ziggurat near Uxmal. Desperado Mad Dog Maddigan, the one man who knew the location of the Sorcerer-King's treasure chamber, was buried in the Western town of Revolver Springs, California, along with a map to the ziggurat's chamber. Revolver Springs, however, was destroyed in a fire on May 1, 1882, leaving the location of his grave a mystery. Garret was about to begin his second expedition to the ziggurat, but suffered from anxiety after losing his lucky shirt in a previous dig.\n\nWhen the player finds the ziggurat, they can retrieve the shirt. They are also able to go back in time to Revolver Springs and pick up a newspaper explaining that the local graves were relocated to make way for a railroad extension project. The player leaves both for Garret to receive, changing history. With the encouragement and new information, Garret locates Mad Dog Maddigan and completes his expedition. Among the treasures brought back from the Sorcerer-King's tomb, Garret discovers a talisman that was reputedly used to destroy buildings.\n\nThe player must operate three levers in the ziggurat to reach the center of the labyrinth and take, among other items, the talisman to destroy its keystone. After dispelling an illusory Minotaur guarding the Maze Center, the player breaks the maze's keystone. This causes the labyrinth to unfurl at the seams. Daedalus appears in person to offer thanks for his freedom, then leaves to ensure King Minos can do no more harm. He leaves the player floating in an area that does not exist in time or space.\nSequel","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MQnJEc8bmw","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Terra Nova Development","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":"1993-06-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"b72bd32c-7272-4917-b57d-3c78408e34f6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"5fd3e9ae-9ee6-45ba-992e-2a5b94151c56.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"e3e4c838-d563-456c-a813-4704af9702ba.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"7c5d3781-9aa8-4d65-9128-300caa13e4a9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"a2f35b39-dba0-4c8d-a24d-d116713a4123.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"2d24b4cf-f7e6-4f74-8038-77ac94c18381.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"d35ca914-59fa-4363-950a-f875455074ee.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"594b520f-11a6-490d-8bb5-85b0986377a2.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":92920,"FileName":"5b4559da-190a-4ba7-a053-6749d51e23ea.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":92917,"Name":"The Lost Vikings","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"In the game, the three Vikings get kidnapped by Tomator, emperor of the alien Croutonian empire, for an inter-galactic zoo and become lost in various periods of time.

Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.\n\nShops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.\n\nYou are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.\n\nIt can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Bullfrog","Publisher":"Mindscape","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133269,"FileName":"a0fe84dc-bf1e-4ed3-ad10-74b4180e77ec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133269,"FileName":"b0076341-92cb-4f07-b32d-31f955e4d3a1.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133269,"FileName":"dd30db3c-01ab-491a-9ab6-16a183f2cd9f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133269,"FileName":"93d6e7ae-c6de-4106-8de9-4725ec57484e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133269,"FileName":"dab84ce5-f943-4cb6-be30-efac01abe170.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138063,"Name":"Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends Pinball","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"I have got a problem with computer pinball games.

If you have got a pound in your pocket and are in the centre of a large town, you will be surrounded by all manner of real silver ball opportunities in arcades and pubs.\n\nNow I will readily admit that if you are three years old (Thomas is aimed at age three upwards), you are unlikely to find yourself with a pound in your pocket in the centre of a large town with time to kill. If you do, you are lost, or your parents have abandoned you. Find a policeman immediately.\n\nThere are four tables (Thomas, Percy, James and Toby), multi-player options and it all works reasonably well – the ball rolls towards the flippers, you hit it and it bounces around the table until it goes out. Some of the shots are very difficult, and some are virtually impossible, but that is not different to other 'adult' tables. It all scrolls reasonably well, it is bright and colourful (kids are bound to like it) and, well, it is a perfectly functional kids' pinball game.

Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).\n\nThese four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading.

On the strategic side, called GeoScape, you get a rotating view of the globe, where you see all visible UFOs (those that are within your detection range) as well as major cities and your base(s). You order movements from here, such as sending out fighters to intercept UFOs, transports with soldiers to assault/recover UFOs, and perhaps assaults on alien bases (if you find any). You also control your research, as you must invent better weapons (the Terran weapons are just no match against the alien weapons) quickly, not to mention all the other cool tech you can recover from the aliens. You also need to control your budget, as you can't afford to overextend your reach. Researchers need to be paid, engineers (who build the new toys) need to be paid, base(s) need to be be built/expanded, planes need to be bought/maintained, supplies need to be replenished, and so on.\n\nYou can earn money by selling unneeded stuff, and you receive funding from the nations of the world; however, a nation can decrease its funding if it decides you aren't operating efficiently enough within its region. It's even possible that a nation gets so fed up with you that it signs a pact with the aliens and ceases funding altogether.\n\nOnce you join a ground battle, the game switches to Battlescape, which is an isometric view of the battlefield with realistic line-of-sight calculations and turn-based combat. Your mission is usually extermination of all aliens on the battlefield, though if you can capture a few it would surely help your research efforts. If you win, you also recover any alien artifacts left on the field, which can then be researched.\n\nIn combat, each of your soldiers has a specific number of Time Units. Doing anything (moving, shooting, turning around, rearranging objects in the inventory etc.) costs a number of TUs. Once a soldier is out of TUs, he cannot act any more this turn (he gets all his TUs back on the next turn, though).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LwmNlVPUTI&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"MicroProse","Publisher":"MicroProse","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133239,"FileName":"72bf5ef7-3a3e-4596-8184-aca639248e8c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133239,"FileName":"d1bbf413-c726-4b99-9727-7617d98cd1a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":133239,"FileName":"076f47be-4265-4eb6-8997-e59ddf149c91.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133239,"FileName":"d6c30983-32f6-443d-82fb-44e35c062826.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133239,"FileName":"4483775d-eecd-45e8-bee6-4f8c855659e4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":133239,"FileName":"0bb0244c-60ce-4bde-96e8-29cb28607d2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":10303,"Name":"Ultimate Body Blows","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"A compilation of the original fighting game \"Body Blows\" and its sequel, available only for Amiga, \"Body Blows Galactic\".

In this particular one, you have to control a small paint gun that contains five different colored paints, and destroy blocks that are falling toward you by making them all the same color. Your paint gun is on a roller at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal strips of colored blocks fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds. Holding down the fire button and pushing left or right changes the currently selected color, and sometimes you only just have enough time to get the right color before the blocks smash into you. As the blocks fall at varying speeds, there are times when an avalanche is set off by a slow block being hit by a fast moving block above it. This is a game that gets very, very frantic.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9dHfomSFOY&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Efecto Caos","Publisher":"Millennium","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"a60bd883-2966-41ce-980f-0ef1f08372a6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"b357e396-ec53-4d19-872e-0678d9de40da.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"c37949f3-df0e-492e-8c79-abcda98dcfa0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"148d5d2f-6d03-4f7b-b6f8-47e9cbc8d9d2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"568c1fdd-715c-44c4-8677-b7de84c96c28.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"1737cfb5-209c-429b-ab49-acce1015b089.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":138065,"FileName":"4259929b-6521-4185-a055-ae1ea82a03ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138066,"Name":"Wembley International Soccer","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":"Officially licensed by the old Wembley stadium, this football game is essentially an advanced version of Ocean's European Champions.

The story involves a space traveler who has made a bad deal buying a space ship known as Whale, which turned out to be half-wrecked. Stranded on the orbit of a remote planet, the traveler and his crew have to find a way to gain money and outfit the ship so that it will stand a chance in that dangerous area.\n\nThe game's character creation involves shaping four crew members. Each is generated at first by selecting his or her father and mother, choosing among humans or an alien species that does not appear elsewhere in the game. Educational background chosen for characters determines their class. There are six classes in total: Soldier, Bounty Hunter, Arania, Biochemist, Psionian, and Doctor. Depending on the class, characters gain access to skills such as healing, setting traps, identifying, using computers, etc. Each character also has six main attributes that can be manually improved in the beginning of the game, increasing the character's \"mutation level\".\n\nIn the beginning of the game the player can only explore one planet, but acquiring money allows him to buy fuel and travel to other planets of the local solar system. There are six planets in total, differing in their visual design but all represented as pseudo-3D mazes set in populated areas, which are explored from first-person perspective. Combat takes place in the same area as exploration and is fairly sporadic, usually involving selecting attack options for each player-controlled character and exchanging blows in a turn-based fashion. The player advances by talking to various characters and completing their quests.\n\nSpace travel is menu-based. The Whale can be ambushed on the way to another planet, which leads to a turn-based space battle shown on a separate top-down screen. The number of turns is determined by action points of the participants. The player can also outfit the Whale with better engines and weapons. Trading plays an important part, since many objectives are based around amassing money. Buying items on one planet and selling them on another for profit becomes the main source of income.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k25trDBsgKY&ab_channel=OldGamesDatabase","Platform":"Commodore Amiga CD32","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"neo","Publisher":"Flair","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"1053cf91-6dfa-4ce1-9990-66ab2c010f3e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"012b7066-09bc-4bab-8e92-8c2418c82e75.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"1744cc25-c10f-4d87-9b7e-7429c62e621a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"04631b27-7269-4f9f-8a92-d5b8ff918d22.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"3d289746-407b-4b2d-94cd-d2c4e8aeddfb.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"5f3c9f18-eb0c-41a4-9df5-bdc446580470.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135575,"FileName":"cfe09ed6-9d66-4c30-847f-51e5b044c122.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":138068,"Name":"Whizz","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint.

There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path).
