Each character's life bar appears on the upper left or right of the screen, depending on starting location. A timer is located between the two life bars.

When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.","Publisher":"SNK of America","ReleaseYear":1994},"122270":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Art of Fighting: Ryuuko no Ken Gaiden","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"b081c652-40d5-4635-8e13-588bb50a3f19.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"14e23589-01ea-40ef-bdb6-d106245e42ce.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"71755047-afa8-4039-8666-a4be3d21dce9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eced208a-fd7a-4a9f-89ba-a21c21a0d419.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0d56b40b-1d9b-4b45-bc35-a4327a84a2ba.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f999e19d-6340-46b0-b0e7-4a36df5f6ecb.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"ce97911d-2ac4-4039-bf04-73b595930299.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b73f4bc3-450e-4b7c-8644-5ed08c287a40.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"525ea256-cbb5-4643-864d-fee0b4a7a14b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3e6914fe-72de-46d6-b06a-15ba177dcf00.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"65a16f1b-6afc-4188-84e6-03d1af436aa5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d8af9550-a296-471b-8ec7-7bb4ed21e0dc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d508f48e-6db0-4b9b-8f7b-59a1054a284a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"7d3cbdbc-c0d3-4612-bce7-a526323ef09b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior","Overview":"In this third and final entry in the Art of Fighting series, the story shifts from Ryo Sakazaki to his best friend and rival, Robert Garcia, as he ventures into Mexico to try and locate Freia Lawrence, a childhood friend, who asked for his help.

Like the Art of Fighting series, Ninja Master's features a super meter.\n\nAnother one-on-one fighting game straight from the arcades for the Neo Geo. Ninja Master's [sic] is set in feudal Japan, and tells the story of 10 unique ninjas who fight each other for their own personal reasons and the chance to defeat the evil Nobunaga and bring peace back to Japan.\n\nAs expected for the genre, the game pits your selected character against a series of opponents in best-of-three-round matches, with your objective being to deplete your opponent's health bar with your basic attacks, special moves (triggered by specific control motions) and super moves (which rely on a power gauge). All the characters in Ninja Master's fight with their weapon of choice, but you can freely choose to put your weapon away and go mano-a-mano. This does not have a major impact on speed or attack power, but changes the movesets significantly, even changing the way basic attacks work.\n\nUses 2D sprite-based graphics and features 1P or 2P vs gameplay.","Publisher":"ADK Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1998-12-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"137355":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"545f5ad6-d434-4804-aa38-56e0e0e9d6c0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"085b5d2f-94c0-4018-a6a0-1bf35213a2a0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b54bc68-8258-468b-92b1-95701febe578.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1de32e6d-ac68-4289-82ca-74d2199af3d8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"584c4ba8-b760-48c5-b8ff-64a0ad67806b.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d3d4266a-0884-4533-89a9-9a3ae7700838.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f3936fb8-e593-4d8a-8117-a80e4f1f6775.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Riding Hero","Overview":"Riding Hero is a bike racing game developed and published by SNK for the Neo Geo in 1990.

Despite being initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS, Top Player's Golf would be later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1994 respectively, and has since been re-released through download services for various consoles, among other ways to play it as of date.\n\nTop Player's Golf received mixed reception from critics after its initial launch with praise towards the presentation and digitized voice samples but many were divided in regards to the gameplay and visuals.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Top_Player%27s_Golf"},"137369":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Aicom","Images":[{"FileName":"0c685b5c-5207-42cf-857e-8eb00935a1d8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1d5ed7d4-89a5-44c3-87cd-631aac04cb58.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1426fa6e-d247-4e6b-8de0-2fa13dce76ff.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8645df3c-0026-4abd-ac66-4a9e7c9d752c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a325f17a-50a2-437f-8413-cea599866000.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d9536d33-efd3-4a29-a3e8-30132d1fe7a4.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1fc043b2-fec6-4c71-af72-b300f8033e58.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"cf216a49-0e1b-4295-bb12-ed2e72087914.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"fee30fcd-9715-49cb-8637-73c998d3766a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"70dce583-1e6e-4f4a-855b-558fdef2b92f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Viewpoint","Overview":"Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter developed by Aicom and originally released in 1992 by Sammy and SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade and console platform.","Publisher":"Sammy","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-20T00:00:00-08:00"},"137370":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Saurus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8c7f1050-3507-4b0e-90e7-52f6be68f138.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4cfd989d-bfe4-410e-95b7-4e6eae5b668f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a2265091-2149-4e2e-95b5-58d01b493932.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"47fed19f-6f35-4cdc-8bda-9a0afb37d75f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3ec4fbad-dcaf-4f72-a507-9dcdaedc43c0.png","Region":"World","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a67e8acc-cf25-4b12-aa2d-d868788b74dd.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fd07302d-2232-45e1-869e-a1c4e93080db.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Choutetsu Brikin'ger: Iron clad","Overview":"Ironclad (known in Japan as Chōtetsu Brikinger) is a shoot 'em up video game developed by Saurus for the Neo Geo CD video game console.\n\nIt was never officially released in North America, but if the game is put on a North American system, the game will be playable in English and display the \"Ironclad\" title screen.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1996-09-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ironclad_(video_game)"},"137372":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Futsal: 5 on 5 Mini Soccer","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Futsal: 5 on 5 Mini Soccer: PleasureGoal: 5 on 5 Mini Soccer"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Saurus Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"59811887-e145-4e24-aeb5-e29122a966a8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bc3ebbbb-b999-45d4-b50b-8955e356c541.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4caed1fb-dfbb-46ea-b8ee-0859aa69f998.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b3d20864-34b2-4ccf-a8cc-31ebc2c24571.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"95e9a164-6178-4f0d-a851-4b62d6349413.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d55743dc-d026-4708-8b59-0f07286f5206.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1e021930-cca8-4f38-a683-fc9087667170.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pleasure Goal","Overview":"Futsal: 5 on 5 Mini Soccer is a Sports game, published by Saurus, which was released in Japan in 1996. \nCompete with strong teams from around the world that stand in your way and get through the preliminary and final to win the \"Zaurus Cup\"!\nSo get ready for the speedy sensations from futsal!

Some levels feature varied obstacles like robots floating around the puzzle to attack the balloon, regenerating blocks, and gold blocks that need to be cleared multiple times before disappearing. The player can also use a power-up called an \"L-Ball\": a meter fills up as lines are cleared, and once ready, the player can trigger a lightning ball to explode outwards from the balloon's current location, removing surrounding blocks.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1990-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-ar3NP0hNOI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzzled_(video_game)"},"137374":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Images":[{"FileName":"7f7128ed-5ae7-460b-9d4d-9b75273e2cde.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"35bdc416-364b-47d9-a78f-863685206ddb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fe1c6452-0ff0-44e4-b236-1b940e14caf1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fc95048b-28ef-4333-8ea9-92ddaf8c9b26.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"db0c4297-f35f-48ae-8698-54669faae6ec.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"07a61db0-bd6e-479d-beba-7263b020e878.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9dabe427-6279-498a-b5f2-639306beee64.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"241020f7-df17-48fe-bc4f-cc3fb6df2a81.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5c4c10ca-f5d4-4829-8fec-1960ccd5f504.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Quiz King of Fighters","Overview":"Quiz King of Fighters is a quiz game developed by Saurus.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-10T00:00:00-07:00"},"137376":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Shin Samurai Spirits: Haoumaru Jigoku Hen","Region":"Japan"},{"Name":"Shin Samurai Spirits: Haoumaru Jigokuhen: Samurai Shodown II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SNK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"83ebec6b-9004-4ab3-adeb-4a2a5e9b1f54.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"85b4b71b-b134-4b92-be02-58f2dbcb1b7a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"31685a59-8d00-44c4-a7be-148015d88219.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"710906cb-6544-4ed7-8847-4f4c6f11363c.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fc83c1a9-b2ec-49f0-afd5-0af5b13bb0c4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0c6e4b3e-6975-4a4d-a3e3-efb0a85acf21.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"40df5288-6233-452a-a301-d62fb324a1a0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6fbbc1d-3a00-4a06-9ec7-a33598e34d01.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01751091-98fa-4f91-b2ba-927bd7ee39a7.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2f79e88e-5b0c-4d18-8140-56206daee52b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"0716fe1b-ff95-44cb-b58a-832c4aa39cd6.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e0232100-caaf-440e-9218-6fcc33f95c2c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e9ab6e5d-5a73-47ec-b76c-160c6fe1606e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0a1a418e-0473-4696-9a65-a3eabb2f8f7e.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6763c294-bdea-464b-b6e0-2c9c8ee42a1d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e846e9bc-e98e-4673-8201-e2f19466c6c5.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e9487de3-b4f1-4e58-b0fa-9ea5c4647bd4.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d30dcfdf-b135-49e4-b982-c9d4959babcf.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5955a0e6-4d61-4497-bc21-a13f25d5ac0e.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ec0fb6c2-5ac5-4d56-b01e-9e298fb0a219.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Samurai Shodown II","Overview":"Samurai Shodown! 2 (Japanese title: Samurai Spirits! 2 \/ サムライスピリッツ! 2) is a handheld game in SNK's popular Samurai Shodown series of fighting games.

Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.\n\nThe game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special \"boss\" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.\n\nEach player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.","Publisher":"ADK Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twinkle_Star_Sprites"},"139936":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Oshidashi Zintrick","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ADK","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"f4efc491-a69e-4fcb-9b6b-59cf084e5c72.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6de27168-81d9-4b83-81e1-36c6e731aee1.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0f71e38f-1674-4ab7-98af-e095b604a14a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"141a987f-c912-423c-a949-43b51f3d64c2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d2508874-390a-40ce-b3ba-0ed8735724a6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4368a33f-6894-4827-8493-fa29ac7979c9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"684c139b-ee0b-4117-a98c-2c5de9c6b640.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Zintrick","Overview":"Once every four years in Asgard, the \"Zintrick Tournament\" is held.

(These are actually referred to in the translation as \"balls\"; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from Bubble Bobble.) At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a \"pointer\", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.\n\nThe fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the side walls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically-colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles—as well as any bubbles hanging from them—are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded.\n\nAfter every few shots, the \"ceiling\" of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.\n\nThe objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. The game consists of 32 levels.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jXJJ5yBeCHI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzzle_Bobble"},"163718":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ADK","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"e5bfca21-41f7-4cae-a861-5fc231cf602e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"478f09c6-a0b7-4116-9068-c013b0a72e34.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7432abf3-806a-4c5b-9277-0e40f74bd79d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1029f124-34a4-4431-a14f-9fc511222f6c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"64e4f6d3-58e2-4ec0-934a-7e8b1561c28f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97d71091-8088-4ff4-a6f0-564ee6a21e00.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b1be5f21-8a3f-4a4b-b508-e0b146f4d9f2.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed"},{"FileName":"c7990ad1-4790-4bdd-ba01-b741fd47b3f1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"45a3bd59-4126-4ce3-a785-e99089e94d86.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"794bbde9-ebf6-499b-9f65-16c64a872979.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b8f64d8e-e678-413d-be01-790a19f0437b.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6f2d4786-87bc-4448-9d3a-de646dd3487a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f9204ef4-71a1-4ebd-bc07-e0b608c3496f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"World Heroes 2","Overview":"World Heroes 2 (ワールドヒーローズ2) is a 1993 fighting arcade game developed and published by ADK with the assistance of SNK.
