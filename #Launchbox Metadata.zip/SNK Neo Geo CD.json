Each character's life bar appears on the upper left or right of the screen, depending on starting location. A timer is located between the two life bars. When one character is drained of energy or the timer runs out, the match is over and the character left standing (or with more life, if neither characters were drained of energy) wins.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"ADK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"d8748e63-e907-4db1-bb1d-4667933c836f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"49ee3a97-4f40-4d8b-a0d3-53ad71b84331.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"62be0675-8d15-495f-8fa6-75a2acb8218a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"60809dd6-5b94-413b-875f-450f27132ac4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"af287080-c705-4dcb-b702-50d042c85fa3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"622dd1a2-6210-45fa-b446-1193104cd2a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"77ef287c-e601-4ecd-8a7d-c5b74a24f4a8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"0ff20381-ed51-4dec-a2fe-82f7b564770e.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"86c628b3-7af8-4d9e-b92a-c827ce1ef3cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"233dde5e-fd7d-4a9e-a1ee-c5a5a582b002.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122147,"FileName":"3e6a6f88-a61e-4e35-8d4c-6dd25d97f075.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":122147,"AlternateName":"Tsuukai GANGAN Koushinkyoku","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":122147,"AlternateName":"Tsuukai Gangan Koushinkyoku: Aggressors of Dark Kombat","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":122248,"Name":"Alpha Mission II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The lunar nightmare of a bloody 200-year space war was thought to be over in the \"original\" ALPHA MISSION.

You, as Blue, are a specialist of the Leaf Dump, and you love Princess Fa of the Raguy family. Unfortunately, Princess Fa has fallen sick from the pollution. It's your job to save your princess in Blue's Journey, a 2D side-scrolling platformer with RPG elements. Go through stages jumping on platforms and avoiding traps, while dealing with a multitude of bad guys, with a special bad guy boss at the end of every level to defeat with special means. To help with this, Blue can use a leaf attack and shrink. The leaf attack, only used when Blue is full sized, lets Blue slam a leaf that stuns any enemies he hits. Blue can also pick up power-ups for a more devastating leaf attack, or change his attack entirely. When the enemies are stunned, Blue can pick them up and throw them across the screen to dispose of more baddies. Shrunken down Blue can't use his attacking power, but he can fit into small crevasses and crannies not normally accessible. Of course, Blue can also dispatch enemies by jumping on them. Since Raguy's economy is flower based, Blue can collect flowers to buy things at special huts. But Blue must take care not to fall into traps or bottomless pits, which cause instant death. Being hit by bad guys or their shots is just as bad. Blue starts the game with two hearts, losing one when he gets whacked by a bad guy. When his heart count goes to zero, Blue dies. Play the game alone (as Blue), or with your friend (as a green Blue) for two-player simultaneous fun.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"ADK","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1994-10-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"19485bda-d44a-43f3-8e0f-89a12414588d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"9c93d734-8310-4f4a-9f77-c41b32fe1f3c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"471d73e7-a47c-4f61-a015-2ec22639f2df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"ba7fcf2e-bf86-41e2-b601-ad4eea641af7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"0694c3d5-0559-40a7-a850-76e8d48f34bc.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"19211c96-d354-461d-b0cb-8112ba86fa9e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"0b980a60-03f3-4c1d-9076-0ba9dbfe14e6.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"c5a7c5b5-4972-41fe-ae6b-b5d02f120d19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"4090cd63-9bda-4e27-9625-93eebcbeafbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"9f9df038-c643-4071-9c7d-29ae324b105a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"FileName":"1908620d-fc55-4a48-aaa7-39558f2bd8e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":137375,"AlternateName":"Raguy","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137375,"AlternateName":"Raguy: Blue's Journey","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":136808,"Name":"Breakers","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Breakers (ブレイカーズ) is a competitive fighting game developed by Visco, which was released for the Neo Geo coin-operated platform on December 17, 1996.

It was released in 1998 for the MVS arcade platform and is the sequel to the popular Metal Slug. It is the second title in the Metal Slug series. The game was later re-released in a slightly modified/remixed form as Metal Slug X.\n\nStory\n\nGeneral Morden, the antagonist from the first game is back once more with his army, bent on taking over the world. It is up to the Peregrine Falcon squad, who are now joined by two new characters: Eri Kasamoto and Fio Germi of the Sparrows Intelligence Unit, to save the day. As the levels unfold, it turns out that Morden has allied with Martians to help facilitate his plans. In the final level of the game, the tables are turned when Morden comes under attack and is betrayed by his Martian allies and he is taken prisoner by them. An ad-hoc alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon squad and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat.

If a team fails to hit the ball before it hits the ground, the team that served the ball earns a point, or earns the serve if it was on the receiving end.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Video System Co.","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-12-18T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"cb74cdbe-9547-4f82-bb50-8fa86695d6ca.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"434d87a4-323e-48cf-bd24-61c8c6bca692.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"13667947-e241-4984-8246-9016ec9a8f30.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"20de84fd-e940-4ba1-97b4-1d1d42552efb.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"2f0b8d4b-708e-4f1a-a565-6bc58e202cc5.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"1395c141-bde5-402a-9baa-4f012bf235f9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137357,"FileName":"8661ffb3-1126-4955-8324-795f872fb537.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137358,"Name":"Pulstar","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Pulstar (パルスター) is a shoot 'em up developed by Aicom Co.

(These are actually referred to in the translation as \"balls\"; however, they were clearly intended to be bubbles, since they pop, and are taken from Bubble Bobble.) At the bottom of the screen, the player controls a device called a \"pointer\", which aims and fires bubbles up the screen. The color of bubbles fired is randomly generated and chosen from the colors of bubbles still left on the screen.\n\nThe fired bubbles travel in straight lines (possibly bouncing off the side walls of the arena), stopping when they touch other bubbles or reach the top of the arena. If a bubble touches identically-colored bubbles, forming a group of three or more, those bubbles—as well as any bubbles hanging from them—are removed from the field of play, and points are awarded.\n\nAfter every few shots, the \"ceiling\" of the playing arena drops downwards slightly, along with all the bubbles stuck to it. The number of shots between each drop of the ceiling is influenced by the number of bubble colors remaining. The closer the bubbles get to the bottom of the screen, the faster the music plays and if they cross the line at the bottom then the game is over.\n\nThe objective of the game is to clear all the bubbles from the arena without any bubble crossing the bottom line. Bubbles will fire automatically if the player remains idle. After clearing the arena, the next round begins with a new pattern of bubbles to clear. The game consists of 32 levels.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXJJ5yBeCHI","Platform":"SNK Neo Geo CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Taito","Publisher":"SNK","ReleaseDate":"1995-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":145982,"FileName":"641f2429-8ae0-4821-aaec-8376b3358e77.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145982,"FileName":"42c47006-4952-4657-861d-9f0a0dc9c5cf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145982,"FileName":"3ce9bcce-ed84-4947-9336-5b14dd0560b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":145982,"FileName":"58271031-f18c-4fcd-8058-541e94983771.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":145982,"FileName":"38983693-ab7e-4b86-8398-8449ea3f95b0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":145982,"FileName":"d51b9e92-4a58-4200-bc9c-f51050bfa464.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":145982,"AlternateName":"Bust-A-Move","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":145982,"AlternateName":"Puzzle Bobble: Bust-a-Move","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":137373,"Name":"Puzzled","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Puzzled is a falling-block puzzle video game developed and published by SNK that was released for Neo Geo arcades in 1990, on the Neo Geo home console in 1991, and the Neo Geo CD in 1994.\n\nThe visuals of Puzzled look a lot like Tetris and the core gameplay is the same: the player controls tetriminos falling from the top of the screen, and filling a horizontal lines clears it.

Unfortunately she is not the only one seeking the star, and thus must fight her way and defeat all the other characters that seek the star in shooter duels.\n\nThe game plays mostly as a vertically-scrolling shooter, with you controlling your avatar and attempting to shoot and avoid the incoming enemies. The difference in this game is that each player has his own play area, a la Puyo Puyo, and the enemies cause splash damage around themselves when shot. Thus chaining the destruction of several enemies creates a combo that performs an attack move on your opponent. These moves can range from targeted fireballs, to special moves unique to each character, to the summoning of special \"boss\" characters that the other player must destroy before continuing.\n\nEach player has a lifebar, and as with most shooters there are bombs, and collectible power-ups to be found. The game features an arcade mode in which you can freely select what character you want to control, as well as a 2-player Vs mode and a story mode chronicling Ran's journey.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo CD","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"ADK Corporation","Publisher":"ADK Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1997-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"7e856d9d-d54a-4aba-80d9-270b7541bea4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"0d909879-e7dd-4c63-8229-7a59a87dc74a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"44d9a8c2-49a5-429c-b44f-b02b854ca94c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"2060965e-87e2-4820-b6bc-0be1318a8780.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"3d27bac6-e8e4-4420-b449-7d07138a4816.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"9b89f250-7230-4ad2-8c40-c46ae1117d06.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"8af6aa09-36a2-450b-9873-830a1198ecc3.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"9286ca9e-de64-42d7-828d-5bfb36a8837e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":139933,"FileName":"d62ce311-6e05-48dd-86a5-f85975f57a3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":137369,"Name":"Viewpoint","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter developed by Aicom and originally released in 1992 by Sammy and SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade and console platform.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"SNK Neo Geo CD","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Aicom","Publisher":"Sammy","ReleaseDate":"1992-11-20T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"0c685b5c-5207-42cf-857e-8eb00935a1d8.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"1d5ed7d4-89a5-44c3-87cd-631aac04cb58.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"1426fa6e-d247-4e6b-8de0-2fa13dce76ff.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"8645df3c-0026-4abd-ac66-4a9e7c9d752c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"a325f17a-50a2-437f-8413-cea599866000.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"d9536d33-efd3-4a29-a3e8-30132d1fe7a4.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"cf216a49-0e1b-4295-bb12-ed2e72087914.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"1fc043b2-fec6-4c71-af72-b300f8033e58.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"fee30fcd-9715-49cb-8637-73c998d3766a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":137369,"FileName":"70dce583-1e6e-4f4a-855b-558fdef2b92f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136851,"Name":"Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer (超人学園ゴウカイザー, Chōjin Gakuen Gōkaizā, \"Superhuman Academy Gowcaizer\") is a 1995 superhero-themed head-to-head fighting game produced by Technos Japan Corp. for the Neo Geo arcade and home console.
