The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.\n\nSolving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together. Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis. Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.\n\nBefore solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge. Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith. Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz. If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vytu1i9PaS4","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"Pacific Softech Inc.","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"f5c41a13-c32c-48f0-bb5f-e481573cce3c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"a68c9344-95f0-4186-95ac-37ff201c6c02.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"de2ed5f1-636d-4ffa-a9e2-b2c2cf1ca223.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"a4b19712-8dfe-41f5-a8fa-e222564c730a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"8acb7711-61ef-4953-9186-df0e69e0cbf4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"52a65dbc-799d-4950-913d-8caa3e67e389.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123690,"FileName":"f9203e8a-6d4f-49a3-89c9-1b2bd5f71e43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":123690,"AlternateName":"221B Baker Street","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":199934,"Name":"2-D Maze","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"2-D Maze is simple maze escape game coded in BASIC.

The only exceptions are the result (shows the player's score) and maintenance menus which can be chosen even after time has run out.

Each level starts with your plane fully fueled and loaded with ammo, waiting for take-off. The bombers appear on radar in the distance to your left, and you must destroy them all before they take out your radar and both of your landing areas.\n\nThere are a total of nine levels, or \"strikes\" of increasing difficulty. On the first, there are only a small number of bombers, which cannot return fire. Subsequent levels have increasing numbers of bombers, some of which can shoot back. Later levels also introduce fighter escorts which move faster than the bombers and will change course to intercept you. Each level consists of two waves, with the second wave appearing only after the first has been cleared from the air. After the ninth strike, the final level repeats until all of your planes are destroyed.\n\nFlying uses fuel, and shooting reduces ammunition. These can be replenished, up to a maximum of 100 units each, by landing on one of your air bases. Whilst flying, you also have the option of dropping an external fuel-tank. This decreases your fuel to 50, thereby reducing your flight time but also improving the speed of your aircraft.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px4nfT9QAL4","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Chuck Gibke","Publisher":"Atari Program Exchange","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194834,"FileName":"f0073754-fb9a-40f1-9a45-6f8680f3ff50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194834,"FileName":"881793f9-9111-41d3-a5c8-e5d4d36ec288.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":194834,"AlternateName":"Air Raid!","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":172392,"Name":"Airstrike","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Planet Cyclon's military force is centred in fortress Gemini.

Because of the harmful effect of the raw materials on aliens, the strange race has decided to use human labour for extraction instead. One day the force field that protects our hero’s jailcell begins to malfunction, and the man dashes toward the exit. That is only the beginning of the nightmare that awaits him.\n\nThe protagonist of Alien Hell has no weapons and the only way to survive is to run. Alien guards, fireballs and toxic gas are some of the many things that the player has to avoid. Crystals can be found in certain places, however their utility is up for the player to figure out. There is a choice of difficulty level in the beginning of the game. Harder difficulty levels increase the agility of the enemy aliens and the velocity of many natural hazards. To finish the game, the player has to find his way out of the labyrinth.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amxn_TuETO4","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Ted Clawges","Publisher":"Syncro, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"368a821c-ba3b-4914-a48e-ca163a55bb64.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"d5acef21-396a-49c1-b1e1-9eedba67c557.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"075fe58a-3f63-44f9-9faf-aa491240f8ea.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"bc77e8b8-cf91-4591-9f52-20d2a90a29fe.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"e0d47af8-d447-4427-afc8-7db5b0d3bfbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"398c1c9c-43ec-412b-8df6-41dda4272cb6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"65462479-0932-4876-bfea-f443d703358f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124699,"FileName":"d9c1d0f8-c4f1-4a34-b906-dd57bafac813.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123727,"Name":"Alien Swarm","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Alien Swarm is a space-themed arcade game for the Atari 400/800.\n\nThe player controls a small vessel on the bottom of the screen which can move horizontally and fire vertically.

Outside of the apartment complex you can score points by eating the mice that run across the clotheslines. Once you've jumped through a window you enter a room where you play a randomly assigned mini game.\n\nThese mini games include: eating all the fish in a fish bowl, stealing milk from a bunch of bulldogs, pushing a birdcage from a table and eating the bird, catching mice inside a big cheese, pushing vases from a cabinet. To make things harder there's always a broom inside every room that tries to knock you around. You score points by completing the mini games within a certain time (the faster the better).\n\nAfter you've completed a mini game you're back in the alley. Make your way back inside the apartment complex and you get a chance to play the love-cat game: try to reach the lady cat on the top row of hearts while rival male cats and cupid's arrows knock you down.

The player is unable to cross ground they have already covered, but the trail can be destroyed by alien creatures under specific circumstances.\n\nEnemies encountered, include: Snarfs, Snuffers, Diagons, and Rippers. Snuffers move at right angles up or down, and can only be destroyed if trapped in a single space. Diagons are bird-like creatures which will move inexorably at a 45 degree angle, and can be destroyed by trapping between two parallel trails. Snarfs are defenseless creatures which will mutate into Snuffers or Diagons after an unpredictable time period has passed. The Ripper will follow your Arex's trail while stationary, and will only relent if the player keeps moving. Trying to cross the Ripper's trail will lead to the ship's destruction.\n\nThere are two play styles, dungeon and arena. Arena features a wide open field, where the goal is to maximize score by surviving as long as possible. Dungeon features a single screen with permanent walls which must be maneuvered around, while attempting to explore the entire environment. If the player explores 90% of the level, they will advance to the next stage. The player starts with 3 vessels, and if all are lost, then it's game over.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofdgu-5lgHg","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"John Anderson","Publisher":"Adventure International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123813,"FileName":"8a89abe5-78b6-4d57-826c-d75cf9d5d4dc.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":123813,"FileName":"e63a86d7-e060-408b-a564-28fc66f6796f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":123813,"FileName":"c8a36c9f-48b2-4569-b015-c9482091c039.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":123813,"FileName":"d932d2e3-c429-4274-8af5-16968aafeebc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123813,"FileName":"1654beea-4112-4fda-abed-339917d01839.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158193,"Name":"Arkanoid","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Arkanoid (アルカノイド, Arukanoido) is an arcade game developed by Taito in 1986.

The terrain plays a role because it changes the movement costs and can provide cover.\n\nThe game comes with six tank types (can be chosen before a match) with certain advantages and disadvantages and twelve scenarios with different victory condition (mostly to conquer or destroy a certain target).

The first was a side-scrolling platform-jumping game created by Robert Tegel Bonifacio and released in 1982 for the Atari 8-bit family.\n\nThe original version of the game on the Atari 8-bit computers presented itself as a side-scroller, with the player's character running continuously from left to right as the background and path continuously scrolled. Control was limited to jumping at three different heights; holding the joystick down and pressing the button resulted in a low jump, holding the joystick up and pressing the button resulted in a high jump, and pressing the button by itself resulted in a medium jump. The running speed of the character was constant; only the height of the jumps differed, although speed of the character gradually increased of its own accord with each passing level. In two-player mode, each player controlled a different colored character with one character running in front of the other. The object of the game was to cover as much distance as possible without succumbing to the assorted perils of the path. Obstacles included platforms and ceilings of differing heights, pits, spikes, platform steps of staggered heights, and other assorted pitfalls. Contact with any part of the landscape other than the path would result in the loss of a player's life and would return the player to the last checkpoint.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuycvBkFRAU","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Robert T.

The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.\n\nThe Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards the player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction.\n\nThe player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink.

He's now at the entrance to Gulls' Grotto.\n\nGULLS' GROTTO\nOne mile south of Balogna Beach is one of the world's most dreaded areas-Gulls' Grotto.  Few have returned from this extremely dangerous series of caves.  Here is a list of some items said to be found in the Grotto:\n   Gruesome Gulls - They fly throughout Gulls' Grotto.  Their touch is deadly to Sly.\n   Eggs - The gulls have laid numerous eggs throughout the Grotto.  Sly must kick an egg (touch it with his webbed foot) to dispose of it.\n   Doors - Doors lead to other rooms in the Grotto.  A door opens only when Sly has destroyed all the eggs in a room.\n   Lasers - These turn on and off intermittently.  One zap and it's goodbye Sly.\n   Spikes - Sly's experience in \"Escape From Epsilon\" has taught him that spikes are very sharp, and are deadly if fallen upon.\n   Ladders - Sly can climb up ladders, but not down (a hereditary phobia).\n   Jelly Cubes - Sly can walk and fall through these, but you can't see Sly when he's in one.\n   Hard Cubes - These look like Jelly Cubes, but Sly cannot penetrate them.  Hard Cubes and Jelly Cubes are usually mixed together, so you must help Sly find his way through the mazes of cubes (counting footsteps sometimes helps).\n   The Ring - The ring is in the last room (room eight) of Gulls' Grotto.  Touch the ring, and you (and Sly) have won!\n\nHINTS\nGet to know Sly - test his limits to see just how much he can do.  Sly is a duck and has wings, so he can fly to a limited extent while in midair.  Practice controlling his jumps and falls.  When you come to a new room, position Sly in a safe spot and figure out a strategy for that room.  \n\nJD Casten was a prolific author of Atari 8-bit games that appeared in Antic: Risky Rescue, Escape From Epsilon, Advent X-5, Biffdrop, Box-In, Rebound, and Maximillian B..","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"J.

Chatsworth's fame began in battle, when he was out on a reconnaissance mission, and his squadron was decimated by enemy planes. The pilot survived, and in the process shot down seven enemy fighters. He shot down thirteen more the next month. For these actions, Germany offered their Blue Max medal to anyone who could shoot Chatsworth down—and Chatsworth got a new nickname—Blue Max.\n\nAs Blue Max, you go out on sorties—flying missions—attacking assigned targets. Targets include bridges, buildings, enemy planes, tanks, bridges, anti-aircraft batteries, vehicles and ships. You progress to new missions as you take out your targets. Various settings can be adjusted before beginning play including control type (normal or pilot), skill level and whether gravity will affect the plane.\n\nYou must drop bombs to take out the ground targets, and this action also represents a key danger for you. Unlike the modern bombers that drop bombs on targets far below, early aircraft engaged in semi-suicidal bombing runs. The pilots started at high altitude, then tipped the planes nose downward towards their ground-based target, and pulled up before they hit the ground. In the middle of the dive and pull up process, they released the bomb. There were problems of coordination, found in the game as well—if you time it wrong, or start too low, you will crash. You only have one life in this game.\n\nIf your plane is destroyed or you complete a mission a ranking is given which ranges from Kamikaze Trainee to Squadron Leader.\n\nThis game has aroused some controversy too, which supposedly caused it to be banned in Germany. In the course of your missions, you end up bombing houses.\n\n(The actual Blue Max/Blauer Max, is a nickname for the Prussian medal 'Pour le Mérite', first given to the pilots Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke. It required downing 8-20 enemy planes, with requirements increasing as the war progressed.)","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD7qVYgEq10","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Bob Polin","Publisher":"Synapse Software Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"e21156a8-89f0-451d-ae1b-436c1eb4f685.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"adec4ad4-3f29-4c52-97b7-35036596d38e.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"ebafa550-3881-417d-85cb-572802fd27bd.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"219982a9-edbf-48b2-9401-3d35affec409.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"10d522b4-d82d-44a0-9980-66fe8b9e9ee4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"5e6179c2-30e6-4ae1-8331-635205ca0596.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"11a3a9d2-c4e3-4599-8045-cdf8bf163b52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"7fa4fa42-1c45-4d95-86f0-df2dc2229e58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"3309ae1f-8dc5-41ad-bb63-312ecbb3af21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"49d781d8-088b-4a48-83fc-671a220de830.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":174404,"FileName":"c31dd535-94e4-4dcb-8b94-6bf4dfb46025.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":161816,"Name":"Blue Max: 2001","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"In this sequel to Synapse's Blue Max, it is the year 2001 and you are flying a flying saucer.

Your goal is to use a mechanical auger to burrow a tunnel from one side of the screen to the next to allow the group to get closer to safety. The escape needs to take place within a certain time, which is marked by the movement of the sun and moon. The fire button switches control between the auger and the fleeing human. Once all humans have been rescued, play continues in the next level or \"quadrant\". Thwarting your plans for escape is an alien bird, who flies over-head and has two special powers. It can launch magna-titanium rods which penetrate the planet's crust and may either kill a human or block their path. It can also hatch a number of smaller probe-birds. These probe-birds can launch their own attack. They can deploy a nuclear rod through the rock, and once encountering a tunnel can release a space-fungus. The fungus is made of a relatively hard material, and grows haphazardly within the tunnel, blocking it. There are two other important aspects of the game: boulders and bombs. Boulders appear randomly throughout each quadrant. They are made out of a super-hard rock which is extremely difficult to drill through, but also almost impenetrable by the nuclear rods of the probe birds. The part of a tunnel drilled under a boulder is therefore relatively safe. The cave explorers also start off with a number of bombs. If a bomb is deployed near the end of one of the nuclear rods, before it deploys the fungus, then the probe-bird above will be killed by the explosion. Extra bombs can be found floating around the tunnels in each quadrant. A bonus life is given at the end of five successful quadrants, and there are a total of 99. There is also a multi-player mode, where each additional player controls one of the three probe birds trying to destroy the first player.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAfJFfEjYBI","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"K-Byte Software","Publisher":"CBS Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"210182e8-1de3-4670-afad-1542f0754d51.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"0c635548-41ef-4eb0-9b05-e3bf0a99f933.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"7ad71d51-9cc6-4923-b96e-8a5814b09141.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"58ef87ac-2bf1-4001-b0e9-1eea80a428c3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"4926e5b2-c2bd-41e8-bc69-29bdc3551e4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"1dc11415-fd11-49b5-bbf6-f9958ada1d1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190292,"FileName":"b1ccdc07-43c5-405c-bbac-63e257f3fd89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150435,"Name":"Bounty Bob Strikes Back!","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Bounty Bob Strikes Back! is the sequel to Miner 2049er and features similar gameplay.

Wandering about the mines are many dangerous mutants.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/6i7gm1UMuZM","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform; Puzzle","Developer":"Bill Hogue","Publisher":"Big Five Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"99512bfd-39b1-40bc-bc65-ee209e95bcf5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"ce05b8c3-e1e8-4734-9853-e63048868e06.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"e630bb34-4302-450f-a87c-b8e6532307bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"9a362b44-6d7f-4943-99c4-c86eff8e43c1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"1a16d281-20e2-4f82-b0cc-081860bb435c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"76756ad8-c3c1-4bd8-8743-4bc86a078c28.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"5ce3abb6-d6f5-468f-8a88-7f0ef1635886.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":150435,"FileName":"335ebfac-58b4-4b82-8091-518576c5ae10.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199332,"Name":"Bourreau","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Softswap","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199125,"Name":"Bowl Trap","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Page 6 Magazine","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190355,"Name":"Bowler","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Strikes and spares, see if you can hit the pins in this game released as part of the \"Arcade Pak #4\" game pack.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Bill Hood","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"ab4d947f-1448-430d-8e76-698005844bc9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"6a3fa4d7-b13f-4554-905a-8ef32171fb2a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"af8293e2-df25-4dfa-a1c6-a49cbf858d29.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"cf9005b4-3428-4f65-8368-15d77cc1c682.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"e3d89146-c19f-4bf6-b70d-1b5b3f110f7a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"6d498492-ca49-4e8b-9913-14557bc7754a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":190355,"FileName":"66d7d774-86bd-44ce-b35b-dcb08032dd1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194630,"Name":"Bowling","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"PDI","Publisher":"PDI","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194630,"FileName":"b766d0dc-6db9-4d24-b9f9-9d5312b3b1b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194630,"FileName":"25627073-539e-4f56-94c6-9626773e44e6.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194630,"FileName":"a8adf67b-cf67-4981-a021-25718c734e44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194630,"FileName":"7083f86b-e574-4c95-892f-f627cb712f1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":194630,"AlternateName":"Bowling I","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":194945,"Name":"Brain Strainers","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Brain Strainers is a collection of two separate games/learning tools.\n\nThe first game is \"Follow The Leader\" where a pattern is repeated using a 4-color circle.

You and up to three friends can select from any of eight player sprites, male or female. There are six skill levels with eight buildings per level. After you finish a building, you will be given part of a special message. There are six messages, one per skill level.\n\nYou get from floor to floor by way of elevators. Be sure the elevator is at your floor when you board or you will fall down the elevator shaft. There are also three ladders out of the basement. Watch out for Flying Half-Pints. They will appear on one side of the building at any floor except the basement and will move horizontally across. You must jump or duck to avoid them.\n\nStarting at building number two, you must also avoid Dumb Buckets. These will walk around and ride the elevators but they always move in a set pattern. Starting on building three and continuing every other building, you have to contend with Brenda, the superintendent's brat. She will put hand prints on your freshly painted walls, which will cost you forty points and require repainting to finish that building. You can grab the candy cane in these buildings and give it to her. This will stop her for fifteen seconds so you can repaint.\n\nStarting with building four, you must beware of the Bucket Chucker. Unlike the Dumb Bucket, he does not follow a set pattern, he follows you. You cannot destroy the Bucket Chucker but there are two ways he can be trapped. One way is to use the paint mixer, a square within a square. You touch it to turn it on for four seconds and if the Bucket Chucker touches it while it is on, he will shake for four seconds. You can turn the paint mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is in it, unlimited times. Another way to trap the Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the Bucket Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The Bucket Chucker will then be stuck in the basement until you lose a brush.\n\nStarting on building five, you must jump over steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a brush. In buildings six, seven and eight, your brush will run dry after eight, seven or six rooms, respectively. To refill, simply touch the large paint brushes in some rooms.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J6f_XG2YFs","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Fernando Herrera","Publisher":"First Star Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":161815,"FileName":"b2ddca84-a1bc-4b0c-8fe5-d2634f65f55c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":161815,"FileName":"0dcc57ac-d678-4e8e-8437-be00a36cea0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":161815,"FileName":"edb16773-0772-4101-9c87-ce78baf60d89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122094,"Name":"Broadsides","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Broadsides is a tactical simulation of ship-to-ship combat between sailing ships of the Napoleonic era (late 18th and early 19th Century).

Controlling the ship involves side scrolling to the left or right, stop, moving forward (and faster), and moving backwards/break (and slower). Additionally, the spaceship can also fire its weapon to unleash a pair of energy bolts.\n\nThe player starts in sector 1.0 and will finish this level after the player successfully goes between an allocated number of pylons, indicated at the top left side of the screen; the first requirement is 9 pylons and will gradually increase with each new sector. In sector 1.1., with the addition of having to complete the pylon requirement, a group of flying saucers, ranging from 1 to 4 (per group), fly in a pattern. The player must avoid these flying saucers by maneuvering out of their way or by shooting them down. In sector 1.3., a new type of robot spaceship (at least one) will fly erratically and attempt to crash into the player's space ship (due to the marvel of technology of that era, enemy ships that disappear from one side of the screen, will emerge on the other side of the screen). Later sectors will gradually introduce more difficult challenges.\n\nThe game ends when the player loses all three lives by crashing into (or being crashed by, it seems sometimes) pylons or enemy space ships. Although there is no penalty in avoiding pylons altogether, the game will also end if the allocated amount of time (indicated by a long bar at the top center screen) runs out. The player may increase speed to move faster, which will present maneuverability challenges in itself. The overall score increases by distance traveled, pylons traveled through, and enemy spaceships shot down. The latest score and the high score are saved and shown in the main menu.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-DZ7JPp3Wk","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","Publisher":"Sega Enterprises, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"8536ccce-2f95-4597-9c70-1dde26463f0c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"632eba05-2c23-4a63-ad20-7cfc6382860f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"68cc8ff0-f5ec-4188-bf5c-6cfa7f75e890.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"0a3f78a6-45e5-46a6-8509-480c01c81883.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"b55785be-bb2f-477e-a35a-3a285fcc4979.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"671bc992-18a6-475a-adfd-228cdf7dc6fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"fe16076d-04c2-4a8a-9355-d251e7abd979.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164719,"FileName":"310126d3-e0fe-4143-9401-78c543341d17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164719,"AlternateName":"Buck Rodgers","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":198235,"Name":"Buffalo Stampede","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The player controls a character that tries to avoid a herd of stampeding buffalo headed their way (basically, a dodge game).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"General Masters","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":198235,"FileName":"f242b0ce-28b7-44fa-9179-8070c2cd9dd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":198235,"FileName":"de247558-d3d3-4717-b0e9-a33594e04714.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":190358,"Name":"Bug Attack","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Bug Attack is a colorful shoot-em-up where you are assaulted by dagger-throwing millipedes, ants, and med flies.

First the ants come at you, wandering back and forth randomly between the cacti and chucking daggers at you if you get under them. If you dispatch the ants, you get to fight the millipede, which advances row by row, not stopping for anything including the plants (or your spider). It also throws daggers from time to time as it advances. The third wave pits you against the deadly med flies, which dance in a line around the screen. If you don't shoot them fast enough, they start to break off from the group, dancing wildly and raining daggers down upon you. Finish this last wave and you get bonus points for the amount of fuel you have left and get treated to a small interlude where a chorus of bugs sings to you as a med fly pollinates a flower. The second and third levels are similar to the first, except that they are tougher. The second wave takes place in a clover patch and the third wave puts you in the flower garden.

The sprayer will always point towards the center of the screen, where your garden resides. Insects will randomly stream out of the garden, and you must kill them by spraying them with DDT. Every 3 rounds, night will fall, and the army will drop you two new cans of DDT. There are a variety of insects encountered. Moths are harmless, but will try to form cocoons on the edge of the screen, blocking your spraying. Cocoons can be destroyed, but not if they're formed in the corners of the map. Bees attack in force, and prevent your spray from reaching more deadly bugs. There are also insects that will inhabit the corners of the screen, and will destroy the player if they come in contact. At night, butterflies appear, which reward the player bonus points for every corner that has remained free. When the player is hit, they will lose their current can of DDT from their sprayer, and a second can will be thrown to the center of the garden, destroying all bugs on the map. Although the player starts with 6 cans of DDT, they in reality have 3 lives.

The player can chose to quit after any roll, and forfeit the next turns to their opponent. If the player rolls a dice combination that does not allow them to progress on their chosen rows, then that player loses all progress during their recent turns.

The ghost can further transform into useful objects such as: magnet, hammer, shovel, key and a torch which can be used to solve some of the puzzles. Each room has a name, which might provide a hint, and the player has a limited time to gather the treasure in each of them. The game is divided into ten levels and a bonus score will be given after each based on an overall timer. The player starts with 10 lives, and if all are lost it's game over. At start the player can select between 3 difficulty levels: child, teenager, and adult, which influence the time available in each room.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Puzzle","Developer":"JV Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Roklan Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177642,"FileName":"3d52a84b-8e0e-4703-8262-8c70ad2a878e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":177642,"FileName":"f69b5284-b1c7-44a5-bb73-1716db8955ea.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":177642,"FileName":"14422e7f-685a-476f-951b-5154ad2071bf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177642,"FileName":"a60f927b-0aac-4555-9100-ba11250b3046.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177642,"FileName":"ddf2322f-51c5-43af-afee-942b18e23324.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177642,"FileName":"43b681b9-35f4-451f-84a3-0052f6909f32.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199071,"Name":"Castle Quest","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The basics of the game is to move your character about the maze-like room in search of keys until a door opens, racing against a fast count down timer.

The cats walk back and forth across the top of a picket fence, meowing constantly and loudly. The player starts with an inventory of six objects which he must hurl out the windows in hopes of knocking one of the felines off the fence, effectively silencing them for a brief period. The protagonist is never actually shown, but is represented by a hand that can be moved left and right between three windows. After selecting an object, the player then positions his hand in front of one of the windows and uses the fire button to chuck the object at one of the unsuspecting kittycats. If the player is able to continuously strike each of the cats within the 5 minute time limit, he wins the game and is finally able to catch some Z's.\n\nBut watch out for Scruffy! This lazy dog, who normally sleeps peacefully in the grass in front of the fence, will awaken in a fury of barks if one of the cats happen to fall on him, adding even more noise to the cacophony of meows.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnWU_frvukE","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Syncro, Inc.","Publisher":"Zimag","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194831,"FileName":"58f89ab4-a0f2-4767-b830-f483604a57a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194831,"FileName":"020055ff-9d85-40f0-aa91-e05ebeaebd05.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194831,"FileName":"a7c72882-4fd7-4f59-b588-70c3241eaaf1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194831,"FileName":"d6dc03b2-5260-4bd0-9425-b3aed3225d52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194831,"FileName":"33f43203-6a81-4e64-bb7b-c1fd3f17f31d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199891,"Name":"Cave In","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Sadly, this game is unfinished and the files on the disk not linked together.

Using your ship's twin cannons you can destroy all of them for points, but every fuel silo destroyed also gives you 5 units of fuel. Fuel decreases over time from 100, so destroying fuel silos is necessary to make it out alive. You control your rate of descent by moving closer to the edge of the screen, but this is much more dangerous and could result in destruction. If you have extra lives remaining you respawn, but are still limited by the fuel you have. After descending far enough you are rushed by rocket ships and martian fighters, which you must destroy or dodge to avoid. After this you descend into a narrow, glowing cavern and come into contact with the reactor at the bottom. You set the reactor to detonate, and must now ascend the cavern you just entered to escape before the reactor explodes. Should you die during this sequence, you are allowed to continue, but the countdown timer is not reset.\n\nAs difficulty increases, emplacements fire back, opening and closing doors, and there are floating mines which block the cavern and must be eliminated.

The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen with a trackball and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.\n\nThe centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. Thus, more mushrooms on the screen cause the centipede to descend more rapidly. The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes four hits to destroy.If the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it moves back and forth within the player area and one-segment \"head\" centipedes are periodically added. This continues until the player has eliminated both the original centipede and all heads. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, a new centipede forms at the top of the screen. Every time a centipede is eliminated, however, the next one is one segment shorter and is accompanied by one additional, fast-moving \"head\" centipede.\n\nThe player is also menaced by other creatures besides the centipedes. Fleas drop vertically, leaving additional mushrooms in their path; they appear when fewer than five mushrooms are in the player movement area, though the number required increases with level of difficulty. Spiders move across the player area in a zig-zag fashion and occasionally eat some of the mushrooms. Scorpions move horizontally across the screen and poison every mushroom they touch, but these never appear in the player movement region. A centipede touching a poisoned mushroom hurtles straight down toward the player area, then returns to normal behavior upon reaching it.\n\nA player loses a life when hit by a centipede or another enemy, such as a spider or a flea, after which any poisoned or partially damaged mushrooms revert to normal. Points are awarded for each regenerated mushroom. A game ends if all lives are gone.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OFM1qgIzW0","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Dave Getneu","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"92cdd682-ddd5-4ca3-828a-e6cfb06fe5a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"7fd9f387-cec5-4f21-8bc2-d44dddc85f71.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"e83e6e0e-c584-45aa-acb5-ef5b01708e9a.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"5309abd1-64d3-4c54-ac67-09cb381f3085.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"ee4101a2-6a2c-427c-8d3a-d12115de6ca9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"5c8c8d8b-ed37-4974-8ff7-cb72eee2ad80.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"0d791064-0c99-4048-abac-d097ee086971.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"6dcbc933-f61e-4a43-8429-32d84f389021.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"68322f88-17c4-4615-90e8-6464088de173.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"47c721ad-9eef-4815-8242-f9440f10f311.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"7584f603-a71a-42c5-a4bd-f022ecfa4f39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"b92b68aa-96e5-4f3a-b2b7-3fd33aef304c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"6767df1c-8617-4fda-a74b-dba048beeb19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123188,"FileName":"4e37cbb7-8572-4f0e-b0ec-0c8df0a5163a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181811,"Name":"Centipede (5200)","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"This is an official conversion of the Atari 5200 Centipede, featuring much better graphics and sound than the original 1982 game.\n\nAppeared on the Atari (UK) tape: Compilation A (TXP7100).\nCompilation tapes were given away with some Atari 65XE and 130XE machines in the UK.\n\nFiring - Press joystick for single shot and hold it down for continuous firing.\n2 Players - Press [SELECT] \nStart Game - Press [START]\nPausing - Press [SPACE] bar.

Program Design, Inc., the company that produced the Arcade Award winner Moonbase lo, has done just that with Clipper: Around the Horn in 1850, its new offering for the Atari computers. What makes Clipper so noteworthy is its overall concept and design - a narrated game simulation with three screens that is not only entertaining, but also an education in sailing and its history.\n\n\nAt the outset of the program, the gamer chooses one of 10 available 19th Century clipper ships to captain and sail from New York to San Francisco via Cape Horn. Because each vessel has its own characteristics, the gamer must outfit each voyage differently. Even in the same ship, a different manifest may be required because of fluctuations in the cost of provisions and the amount of money on hand in the treasury.\n\n\nThe gamer outfits his clipper by entering the number of crew members he or she wishes to hire and the amount of cargo and provisions the ship intends to take on. All the information is entered using the joystick and the fire button. (That's \"userfriendly\".) Once the gamer has outfitted the vessel, the race around the tip of South America begins.\n\n\nDon't get the idea, though, that it's clear sailing.\n\n\nTwo screens display the ship's logbook and a map of the western hemisphere. However, most of the time the player will use the main screen, which shows the bridge of the clipper and provides four important readings. Proper usage of these readings is absolutely essential if the gamer doesn't wish to run aground or get lost at sea. (If either happens, a news clipping relates the sighting of the shipwreck and the loss of all hands.) The readings, from left to right, are: the percentage of unfurled sail, the clipper's position in longitude and latitude, the vessel's heading and speed, and the wind's direction and speed.\n\n\nFortunately for us landlubbers, the game designer, John Bayes, provides a build-it-yourself compass with the program.\n\n\nPerhaps not so fortunately, he has also filled the oceans with uncharted reefs and maverick icebergs - oh, the sound of splintering wood! In addition to those dangers, the crew may become ill or decide to mutiny. If they do mutiny, the captain has the option of putting some or all of them in chains. There are also other dangers calculated to convince garners that sailing the Seven Seas is a little tougher than floating a rubber ducky in the bathtub.\n\n\nAs if the program itself weren't enough to satisfy most garners, PDI added an optional voice cassette to the simulation. If the gamer elects to use it, it entertains with traditional sea chanties, gives advice from an ex-captain, and threatens with a crusty pirate.\n\n\nAll in all, Clipper is an entertaining simulation. But don't allow the lapping waves to dull your judgement because that sound and the sound of seagulls usually means there's a reef right ahead. Hard to port! Lower that sail!","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"PDI","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195182,"Name":"Cloak and Dagger","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195935,"Name":"Cloak of Death","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Bug-Byte","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195935,"FileName":"9e2f9b14-3186-4cfc-94a9-45d5325a8870.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":195935,"FileName":"e4d3ea9e-1088-4c53-90bc-cc48d16ad847.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198052,"Name":"Clonus II","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Clonus II is a graphical adventure game for the Atari 400/800.\n\nYou have wandered into the city of the future, circa 2086.

After creating a clone, the player is hunted by the police force, regularly throwing the player in jail when they are discovered. The player can walk out of jail unharmed, though, as there are no bars in the jail. The city layout is identical to that seen in the original Clonus. There is an arena where the player can battle a gladiator, a casino to make money, and a clone store which sells body parts. There are various warp chambers throughout the city, which take the player to special locations including a troglodyte cavern and the offices of the game's developer.\n\nSeveral zones have wandering monsters which will attack the player. When the player encounters a monster, they will lose 10 units of energy in their defeat of the creature. The player starts with a total of 100 energy units, and when all are lost, it's game over.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Crystalware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199078,"Name":"Closeout!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"COMPUTE!","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166391,"Name":"Cloudburst","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"On a small, unknown planet, spinning in a distant system, \"Chip\" Montana peers at the setting sun and readies himself for the most challenging adventure of his life.

If so, beware - from its alien outtakes cover art to its lame screen graphics, Collision Course is about as interesting and original as Parchesi.\n\n\nThe basic motif here is warmed-over Defender - a good choice, but badly done. Your job is to protect a trio of cargo ships returning home from a five-year mining expedition. All four of you are heading through a particularly dangerous part of the galaxy that seems to be lined with floating mines and killer satellites. Your escort cruiser comes with guns to nail the mines and satellites as well as a shield to protect you from them but the shield time is very limited (about six direct hits will do you in). You're up against a time limit for completing your mission and you must complete it. You've got to make sure that those cargo ships make it home.\n\n\nAlong with four different skill levels, the game contains four different types of mines - well, make that three, since the regular and \"Mirus\" mines are exactly alike, except for the way they're depicted on the screen. There are also smart mines that try to chase you and accelerator / decelerator \"beacons\" that speed up or slow down your convoy whenever you hit them.\n\n\nThe gameplay and graphics will make you wonder why you need 24K of Atari computer memory to play it. You've got a very short amount of time to get through all three mine fields and the cargo ships are such big, dumb targets that you can just about count on losing all but one of them (the designer must have counted on it too - you only have to get one ship home to win a round and there's a huge point bonus for getting another one through). Boiled down, Collision Course is your standard space shoot-em-up with all the excitement surgically removed.\n\n\nOnce you're a little skilled at blowing up the mines (concentrate on accuracy), start exploiting the accelerator / decelerator beacons for a high score.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9qk8dJJEk","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Syncro, Inc.","Publisher":"Zimag","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194832,"FileName":"e7f008b3-2fd1-4276-a4c9-c26e3276abd7.JPG","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194832,"FileName":"a50336fd-ed79-47be-a86d-a8a10db7e353.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194832,"FileName":"35801c0c-3d7f-455d-9ea9-865c61b479ba.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194832,"FileName":"1dc32072-95a5-4169-959b-c2d0d27ea016.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194832,"FileName":"7d9df642-9a0d-46cc-97cb-4982d72b1713.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193831,"Name":"Colonial Conquest","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Colonial Conquest is a grand strategy game set during the late 1800's and early 1900's that puts you in charge of one of the six Imperialistic powers of the time (Great Britain, France, Germany, U.S., Russia and Japan).

The Jebs have forced a energy embargo on your planet and won't supply the Power Generating Complex situated on the moon which supplies all the energy for the planet from their power plants located on four asteroids. You have decided that your mission will be to get the energy bars needed from the asteroids, but the only way to get there is through four Cosmic Tunnels and if you are successful then you have to land on each asteroids and collect all the bars that they have before returning back to your base..\n\nCosmic Tunnels is a single screen game split into various parts with each asteroid being played over three parts and all must be completed for your mission to be successful. The first screen is viewed from the side where you control your space craft from the bottom of the screen and you must guide it upwards into one of the four Cosmic Tunnels while avoiding falling meteors. You can move the ship left, right and upwards but gravity will try to pull you downwards and you won't stop straight away when you move in a direction. Hitting the meteor or your base loses you part of an energy bar, moving your craft also loses you energy and when this empties then it is game over.\n\nOnce you reach the entrance to a tunnel the game switches to a 3rd person view as you fly into the screen down the tunnel shooting or avoiding the space mines coming towards you for 25 seconds to complete the tunnel. You now appear on a side view screen where you have to land on landing pad while avoiding the missiles fired from the defence systems. Once again inertia and gravity play a part as you move your ship around the screen. You are able to bomb the defence systems but bombing loses you energy. Once you land you now see a side view screen viewed from an elevated angle and you appear from your rocket at the top of the screen. There are four energy bars at the bottom of the screen and you must collect them one at a time and take them to your ship.

Soon after, Moriarty would be working at Infocom.\n\nThis game was published in issue #5 of A.N.A.L.O.G.

In this game, the contestants face off on a futuristic battlefield. The object is to destroy the opponent's command center. The game can be played with two players, or one player competing against the computer.\n\nCYTRONS (short for CYbernetic elecTRONic units) come in five types: Mines, Shooters, Bunkers, Commanders, and Missiles. Shooters are constantly scanning for enemy units in their three space range. They will fire at the closest target. The Commander unit can relay orders from you to all Cytrons within three spaces of its location. Missiles soar above the battlefield. When detonated over an appropriate target, Missiles can destroy up to four Cytrons at once.\n\nThe battlefield is a 2-D grid. One contestant starts on each side. The main features on either end of the field are the Command Centers. The goal of each manager is the destruction of the opponent's Command Center. The players can use energy to create more Cytron units during the battle. The battlefield has eight Power Centers, and by occupying a Power Center a player will accumulate more energy.\n\nAhead of its time in many ways, Cytron Masters used multi-thread software routines to enable all the units to move in real-time. It also included an interactive tutorial. Dan Bunten went on to expand his ideas from this game in his later work Modem Wars, published in 1988.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Dan Bunten","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194746,"FileName":"9eadab24-1fbd-4ac1-a45f-c577f60f3f64.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194746,"FileName":"57049cc7-b310-4eed-8122-ac812cf8dc07.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194746,"FileName":"e3ac4781-5888-4fdc-9714-17dc580c51c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197275,"Name":"Cywilizacja","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Cywilizacja (Civilization) is a tactic strategy game, similar in its gameplay to Empire: Wargame of the Century.

Battles occur in real-time, though orders may be issued while the game is paused.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"MicroProse","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195286,"FileName":"fc3214c0-0860-4968-b3e2-7ddfe8a36ecb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":195286,"FileName":"c6f4799e-99f0-4efb-9e14-c8b4fc0983c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197181,"Name":"Deepspace","ReleaseYear":"1979","Overview":"From More BASIC Computer Games.

The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy or its projectiles, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.\n\nThe enemies: Lander, Mutant, Swarmer (150 each), Baiter (200), Bomber (250) & Pod (1,000). 100 points times level (up to 5) per humanoid saved at end of level. Extra life and smart bomb per 10,000 scored; however, at 990,000, player gets extra life & smart bomb per enemy destroyed, and repeats per 1,000,000 thereafter. \n\nThe Atari 8-bit version was part of a set of arcade games that were ported to the system after its release that were well regarded for gameplay and graphics accuracy to the arcade.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toAVC_97QTY","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Steve Baker","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"b7b8d2a1-70fc-41a9-a203-ddd88d3962ed.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"472b13a1-aee8-405a-9904-ee4f6c5fd8bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"d9bcc399-cea2-4f6f-96de-c77d34f3fb3d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"6c489800-210f-4669-9289-63d0c25b281c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"b3a5870c-73ff-43ee-8222-fbc355675dc1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"26982346-bca6-4c03-acca-2c2184205fce.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"29ae2173-6795-4f39-aad6-1f355ea56920.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162788,"FileName":"c9ca09b2-5c25-4722-8c79-01cac00e4afb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199077,"Name":"Deflector","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"COMPUTE!","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":173185,"Name":"Deflektor","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word.

There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.\n\nThe game was originally released in 1987 for the Commodore 64 and other platforms.

Stage two involves climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage involves the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage involves Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero to be reunited with Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.\n\nUpon completion of the fourth stage, the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get speedier. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Nintendo","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"6d7ea797-780b-499a-8731-7c5ba7ea3d17.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"52d65225-1ae8-4568-857f-cbde86f88be7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Norway"},{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"037a8cb6-5f33-42a1-bef9-4372a4801f8f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"a935d412-7869-4bd4-b629-94a09f18825d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"947c0870-3b23-4cc7-888b-c6451ea5f564.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"0ea01eb6-5e5b-470c-b3eb-4fff23045848.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":122561,"FileName":"0ec34042-48e8-45fe-a828-66286eea2dd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158027,"Name":"Donkey Kong Junior","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The game's eponymous star, Donkey Kong Jr., also called simply Junior or abbreviated as DK Jr., is trying to rescue his father Donkey Kong, who has been imprisoned. Donkey Kong's cage is guarded by Mario, in his only appearance as an antagonist in a Nintendo video game.\n\nDonkey Kong Jr. must rescue his father by working his way through a series of four screens. Mario attempts to stop DK Jr. by releasing animals and putting obstacles in his way. When DK Jr. succeeds on the last screen, Donkey Kong is freed and kicks Mario into the distance, leaving him to run away and to an unknown fate; the game then begins again at a higher difficulty level. \n\nLike its Donkey Kong predecessor, Donkey Kong Jr. is a platform game. There are a total of four stages, each with a unique theme. DK Jr. can run left and right, jump, and grab vines/chains/ropes to climb higher on the screen. He can slide down faster by holding only one vine, or climb faster by holding two. Enemies include \"Snapjaws,\" which resemble bear traps with eyes; bird-like creatures called \"Nitpickers,\" some of which can attack by dropping eggs; and \"Sparks\" that roam across the wiring in one of Mario's hideouts. DK Jr. can jump over these enemies while on platforms, switch from one vine/chain/rope to another to dodge them, or knock down pieces of fruit that will destroy every enemy they touch before falling off the bottom of the screen.\n\nTo pass the first three stages, DK Jr. must reach the key hanging next to his father's cage, whereupon Mario flees while pushing it off the screen. In the fourth stage, DK Jr. must push six keys into locks on the topmost platform to free Donkey Kong. After a brief cutscene, the player is taken back to the first stage at an increased difficulty. A bonus timer runs throughout each stage, and any points remaining on it are added to the player's score upon completion.\n\nDK Jr. loses a life when he touches any enemy or projectile, falls too great a distance, or falls off the bottom of the screen. Additionally, he loses a life if the bonus timer counts down to zero. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives.\n\nLike in its predecessor, Donkey Kong Jr. features a kill screen at level 22. Due to the level counter only having one digit, the counter shows numbers 1 to 9 in levels 1 to 9, seven blanks in levels 10 to 16, and the letters A to F in the levels 17-22. The kill screen occurs the same way as in Donkey Kong, where an integer overflow occurs after too big a result is given after a multiplication problem in the computing. The timer counts as if there are 700 points, then kills Donkey Kong Jr. until all lives are taken.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdJWIevjIWM","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Atari, Inc.","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158027,"FileName":"164b8d0b-9966-4ce3-8e34-70defb28e5bb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158027,"FileName":"ebcdd4a1-9bc3-44ec-87d1-d7381aa0869b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158027,"FileName":"8e824de2-1dbc-4ee6-a910-59f497aa71a6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158027,"FileName":"73b1bfd1-cc15-4a01-8615-caac5096af11.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158027,"FileName":"5ee5414d-fdc5-4e10-8fe5-869980751a2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158027,"FileName":"b2a58db1-a83c-455d-a5a6-ac741d175f3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":158027,"AlternateName":"Donkey Kong Jr.","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":198011,"Name":"Downhill","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Downhill is a 1-player arcade game for the 8-bit Atari computer.\n\nThe player controls a timed downhill skier, who attempts to navigate a wooded track while travelling through 10 gates.

The game may be played by 1 to 4 players. You take on the role as a Weyrleader fighting the deadly Thread.\n\nThe game consists of two major phases: Negotiation/Intrigue, where you negotiate with Lord Holders or Craftsmasters, and Thread Fighting. where you fight the Thread from infesting your lands.\n\nThe strategic part is the main part of the game. Here you try to negotiate with Lord Holders of Craftsmasters to make allies in your fight against the Thread. You can facilitate negotiations by organizing special events: To win the confidence of a Lord Holder who fancies dragons, invite him to a Hatching. Weddings also provide opportunities to score diplomatic points. When diplomatic maneuvers fail you, you may be forced to resort to a duel -- a wounded leader is unable to take any actions for a long time --, but this may jeopardize your status with peaceful leaders. Finally, conclaves may be called up after certain events like the death of a Weyrleader. A Dragonrider conclave will cancel all ongoing events for all Weyrs. A Lord Holder conclave will only cancel events involving Lord Holders and the Master Harper. Time passes in realtime during the strategic phase, but you can pause the game.\n\nThread fighting occurs at the end of each year. During this phase of the game, you mount your dragons and you must pursue the falling Thread and char it in midair with the dragon's fiery breath before it lands. Miss a Thread and it may destroy you... or hit the ground and turn the land to dust.

There are three scenarios to choose from at the start of game: Over There, Voss's Last Fight and Red And Black. In addition, there are four different mini-games to choose from: Bloody April, Sausage Run, Contact Patrol and The Eleventh Hour.\n\nDuring game play, you will face many of the situations that the period's pilots had to face. A dogfight in Eagles can involve as many as twenty planes. Each aircraft will have an ID number on them running from 1-20. 1-10 are always the Allied aircraft and 11-20 are the Germans. Play proceeds in rounds from the lowest number aircraft going first and continuing all the way up to the highest number aircraft doing the last move. Play continues in this fashion until all planes have been shot down or returned to base. The play field is defined in squares running north, south, east and west. Each square represents an area roughly 50 yards on a side. There is also a third dimension of squares, which is altitude. Each level of altitude is 25 feet high. Pilots can see targets four squares out and can fire their weapons one square out. Weather conditions, like clouds and wind, will also play a factor in game play.\n\nAt the end of each game, scores show how many kills were made, the time frame for completing each mission and ranks. Ranks are determined on successful missions you have completed.

Adventure stretches out before you, forty characters of text per line, or maybe sixty. As in all text adventures, that particular stretch of forest path in Empire of the Over-Mind may become over-familiar before you get yourself to the right place with the right items to travel finally to the red planet.\n\nEmpire of the Over-Mind departs from typical text adventures, though, in its movement. Cardinal directions are not used. Instead, one references the avenue of movement: the road, door, or even cliff-face which leads to the next location. Also unusual is the ability to look ahead -- e.g. down the road -- and see what is there before moving. The objects you see ahead can vary from game to game: sometimes the key glints enticingly while the skeleton hides in the shadows, other times you can only see the key if you bravely confront the skeleton. Menacing though the perils are, your mistakes are gently handled: even the crocodile only \"clobbers\" you.\n\nTypical of the era, the parser handles two-word verb-object combinations, or three words if an adjective is needed. Depending on the platform, item locations can vary from start to start, and getting clobbered means you have to hunt them all down again. Necessary clues are hidden in a long, printed poem which comes with the game. Avalon Hill's instructions are a fascinating artifact themselves. Besides the profoundly basic level -- covering the \"prompt character,\" the back-space key, and the exigencies of programming in 48K or less -- a memory map is offered. No simple \"Save\" command or hotkey here: a little assembly language saves the game state.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Avalon Hill","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195065,"Name":"Enchanter","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You are a dim ignorant Apprentice Enchanter, but your task is enormous.

Played from a top-down perspective, the player's goal is to explore and survive the jungle-themed Congoland, Middle Eastern-themed Arabia, Medieval England, a sea voyage across the Mediterranean, an Underwater voyage aboard the submarine Tari, and finally delve into the Underworld itself. There, they must confront the Prince of Darkness, and rescue the missing Guinevere or Lancelot (depending on the player's tastes). Each zone has a guardian whom must be defeated before the player can advance to the next area.\n\nThe player starts in the Hall of Heroes, where they must recruit warriors, purchase supplies, weapons, and armor. After leaving the Hall, they can not return. Treasure chests are found throughout the wilderness, containing a variety of goods. The player will randomly be interrupted by combat through their explorations in the wilderness. Sometimes, enemies if greeted nicely, will join the player. Combat is determined by comparing the player and enemy's offensive and defensive powers. Each round the player can attack or flee. If attacking, each round enemy and friendly units are lost depending on ability differences. Defeated enemies may join the player's forces.\n\nIn each zone, the player's goal is to gather up troops and resources, so that they're strong enough to survive more difficult areas.

The game is oriented toward pilots-in-training, but there are options for laymen too: an easy mode, and a slightly more detailed reality mode. These modes do not require the same level of knowledge.\n\nFlight Simulator II is packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace. In this game the plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen. The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to make the gameplay easier.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/vjAumB7txQU","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Sublogic","Publisher":"Sublogic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196531,"FileName":"e7948559-1dcd-4c9f-840e-442ab703ccd6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196531,"FileName":"cd219877-6f18-45b3-8512-c1ed67429155.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196531,"FileName":"a7904f5a-caf4-40d8-b569-350f28fe5279.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196531,"FileName":"3b20e52a-a7a1-4903-8834-ad6c5d4e0647.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196531,"FileName":"14832185-d156-41ef-8ae5-192fdc4a37cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196531,"FileName":"91508370-8151-49b5-8bd0-025665850b1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199485,"Name":"Flip","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Atari Computing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194343,"Name":"Flip and Flop","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Flip and Flop is a kind of Pac-Man in isometric graphics on platforms which are connected by ladders.

In the 8-bit version, enemies flash across the screen either vertically or horizontally, and disappear before appearing again from a random location. Energy is replenished by coming in contact with hearts. The ST version of the game has added digital voice samples and the enemies remain on screen and randomly ricochet from the edges, possibly diagonally. Strength is regained by collecting Atari symbols instead of hearts. Both ports of the game were later re-released by Bug Byte under the title \"Missing...

Fail to get enough, and your supply -- of spare biplanes -- goes down. Of course, rack up enough points, and your supply of planes increases.

The ground may be the most dangerous thing on the screen, since you must dive sharply to strafe the supply trucks, and there's scant room for the loops required to out-maneuver enemy pilots.

The player has two weapons, a gun and bombs, but only one button on the joystick. Most of the time the button fires the gun, but when the helicopter has turned so it's facing out of the screen, then the button drops bombs. Enemy missiles track the player's movements for a short time before running out of fuel and dropping back to earth, and the map is populated by a number of enemy helicopters similar to the player's own.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KfjYI7jko0","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Steve Hales","Publisher":"Synapse Software Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"be6b9c25-480c-496e-b9f3-13c37bc3b48e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"41969e9c-8e70-4972-9e79-4cd83b3e35ae.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"b6403b0e-27c2-43ab-9f1b-57ed413eb7d0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"4ebd70d6-b086-44f5-b162-f91d85f8d4eb.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"126e44ce-4384-4d3b-921b-57ddc1afd6dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"5c5104ed-eb8f-4c96-88ad-7949ed9b8212.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162033,"FileName":"814d2f57-29b9-45fd-9055-7b53dbb89d8c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177443,"Name":"Fortress","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Fortress is a fast paced computer game in which two rival lords seek to gain domination over the countryside.

Sublight Ion Drives, Gamma-Ray Lasers, Rifter Pods that can rip space itself -- not to mention any hostiles -- and a Hyper Drive that'll zap you and 50,000 pounds of cargo from one corner of your starmap to the other in a blink of an eye. And now she's yours. The trouble is that you're left all but broke. The galaxy is out there waiting -- deals to made, star systems to explore -- and you have an empty hold and 500 Megabucks. It's enough to buy a few hyper cells and some penny-ante cargo like monopoles or wine, but the return on that stuff won't pay for the ion fuel to dock, not to mention patch all the holes the Thoft raiders will put in your shield between ports-of-call. That is, unless you can figure profit margins and targeting corrections like a pro. That's the galaxy out there; it ain't for the faint-of-heart.\n\nAvalon Hill's Free Trader is a no-safety-net, you-against-the-galaxy space merchant game. The profit margins are tiny, the market fluctuates mercilessly, the Thoft spider attack cruisers are deadly accurate, and everything costs Megabucks. The Atari version has an arcade side, combat requiring a quick eye and a light touch, while on the Apple careful estimation -- laser range, angle, and impact -- wins the day. Uniquely, you do not aim your lasers or Rifters, but correct them according to your bridge computer's report of the previous shot. The target is invisible and your correction must be the inverse of the report, giving the rapid-fire combat on the Atari a brain-churning verisimilitude.\n\nRegardless of platform, though, combat is merely another liability for your bottom line. Profit is the measure of survival: keep your shields intact and you'll have ample time to blast the occasional Thoft cruiser. Days fly by, however, like minutes on the clock, meaning that the hefty margin you scouted can be negative when you finally arrive with the cargo. The fourteen planet types -- discernible when you arrive in a star system -- each have fixed imports and exports among thirty-five different trade goods (which include the various fuel cells for your ship). The planets and the starmap are fixed from game to game, allowing you necessarily to hone your strategy.\n\nThe game screen sequence varies by platform, but principally consists of a ship status screen, cargo manifest, a map of your local star system, a hyperspace map leading to sixty-three other star systems, a planetary market screen when you're landed, and a first-person-view out your main portal whenever the Thoft come to visit. A few simple sounds like your ion drives in subspace, the tick of days turning over, and the relentless zap of Thoft lasers, serve to heighten the tension by reminding you of the Megabucks draining away.\n\nSaved games?

It is an early example of the space empire game, later to be refined into the 4X genre.\n\nThe player takes the role of the commander of the flagship of the planet Galactica. The mission is nothing less than universal conquest: the entirety of the Central Galactic System (consisting of 20 planets laid out in a three-dimensional map) will have to be conquered and held within a time limit of 1000 years.\n\nEach planet has different ratings in technological sophistication and population size. Technological sophistication determines the amount of resistance in establishing air supremacy over a planet, while larger population size increases the difficulty of securing the ground with infantry. Combat takes place automatically, but can be aborted at any time with a retreat order. Once conquered, a planet can be used to build ships, draft troops or collect taxes. Only technologically advanced worlds allow for ship construction, while population size directly influences the amount of troops raised and money raised. Population increases with time, and after a planet has been part of the player's empire for 10 years, the limit of troops to be raised increases from one to two per cent.\n\nThree types of ships can be constructed: fighters are employed in the attack to establish air supremacy, transports are used to ferry troops to the ground, and scouts are sent to establish intel about systems not yet visited by the main fleet.\n\nUnlike in most science fiction set on an interstellar scale, there is no faster-than-light travel or communication in Galactic Empire. Other ships cannot be contacted when not in the same star system as the flagship, and are lost if they do not rendezvous with the main fleet within 5 years of reaching a system. So scout missions and deployment orders for newly constructed ships must be carefully planned in advance, taking into account sub-light traveling times. Should the waiting time for a certain ship to return (or be built) be too long, the commander can be put into suspended animation. Otherwise, the game runs in real time - one year passes in about 4 minutes.\n\nThe game interface consists of a command console. It displays a view of the current locale, a calendar, an overview of the fleet's resources, and information about the current situation from Computer Central. A galactic map can be accessed for orientation, while orders are carried out through subordinates: Lt. Starbuck is responsible for scouting missions, Lt. Bayliss for handling planetary production, drafting and taxation, navigator Kirman for setting the fleet in motion towards another system, and Dr. Henderson for putting the commander to cryogenic sleep.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"David H.

The galaxy is divided into a large 8 x 8 grid, with each zone containing starships, planets, asteroids, suns, and other bodies. The player has 2 movement options, sublight and hyperspace, where sublight allows movement within a quadrant and hyperspace allows movement between quadrants. The player chooses which direction to travel from 360 degrees, and the distance to travel. The player must closely monitor their fuel reserves, personnel, and ship status. Trading is menu-based, and each starport is willing to sell or purchase specific goods.\n\nThe player comes under attack often by Vegan warships, which appear and surround the player. The player's ship has meson lasars and rifter pods to defend themselves, which are fired by choosing a direction and power of the shot.\n\nIn the Atari 400/800 version, combat occurs with just a single ship at a time, and battles are fought with a first person perspective.

Keeping with the absence of faster-than-light travel or communication established in Galactic Empire, it is impossible to know what a commodity goes for on a certain planet unless it is visited. While the ship computer keeps track of prices, these might be out of date when a planet is revisited. The prices follow a dynamic economic model of supply and demand. \n\nBartering is also necessary on most planets, since only on Galactica cargo can be converted to credits.

Once the Gemstone Warrior has collected the five gemstone pieces, he needs to move back to the point where he began the game.\n\nThe hero has to go underground because of demons. They stole the gemstone from humans, because they were jealous of the good magic it brought to humankind. They broke it up and spread it throughout their dungeon, to hide it.\n\nThis game is not just a \"shoot-em-up\"; it has many of the features of that style of game, but also gives players time to think. It includes a pause which helps one map and also to freeze a room, to see what is running toward the Gemstone Warrior. The game also has a save feature, which is useful just before entering a new room: if the Gemstone Warrior is ambushed, players can give him another chance.\n\nAfter killing opponents, the Gemstone Warrior has the opportunity to search the bodies for treasure. Monsters carry arrows, and also \"magic bolts.\" The latter are interesting, as they destroy treasure too, as well as the Gemstone Warrior, should he be too close to the explosion. Magic items abound, and help the warrior make it through the caverns. Some magic items are traps too; there is a healing potion bottle that is similar to a poison bottle. Other magic items include effects to freeze opponents, turn the warrior invisible, hide him among monsters with an illusion, annihilate all opponents in the current cavern, and cure disease.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Paradigm Creators, Inc.","Publisher":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196108,"FileName":"508beef2-eac7-41dd-b800-4ce4c48237bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196108,"FileName":"4b4ea337-5d03-433f-b2c5-f60d3f7d6fa0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196108,"FileName":"e8c6b617-72a5-42bd-b38b-557e6c4b192a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196108,"FileName":"8ef19289-8143-4776-87a4-0e9240108472.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196108,"FileName":"f7225e1b-5462-4590-9a58-bd52ea36858a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193832,"Name":"Genesis","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"An action game set at a time when nascent, insectoid life forms battled each other for survival and for domination of the ecosystem, in an ancient epoch at the dawn of life on Earth (or thereabouts). The player, cast in the role of a scorpion, is tasked with overcoming an incursion by a particularly mean strain of killer spiders. Similar to Tempest, the player patrols the top edge of a tunnel seen from a bird's-eye view, as enemies rise up from the depths. Firing volleys of venom will destroy the unwelcome arachnids as they try to scale the walls; if they manage to crawl their way to the top, they open holes in the tunnel wall (which spell death for the player). Each wave of attack adds an intermediate platform within the tunnel, which the spiders can move along, change directions and dodge the player's fire. Also traveling along the top edge is a special color-changing brick: one color means instant death for the player; the other can be picked up, which increases the score multiplier, acts as a shield and allows the player to fix broken sections of the tunnel wall.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Strategy","Developer":"Activision, Inc.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1984-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"f04c0064-8f2b-4a6d-8f72-c82f7b74bfc5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"1326a179-b270-401a-bdaa-47a094c15b01.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"f17e23a0-49df-4c68-94b4-75538bbb5507.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"cd6028d5-2e7e-46e1-a823-ea9debb1f2e6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"5ee947ef-134e-433a-8ab9-86b9ed1c3d2c.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"ee1a309a-6de4-4e09-9881-f40d1d624fba.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"cbcba47b-2187-4fb6-933d-cea695292b3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"14c91c94-4ce6-4dfd-b609-360d23ac4dbd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165634,"FileName":"b7297e64-3882-42b4-8b11-5bd278824b9b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198035,"Name":"Giant Slalom","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Giant Slalom is a 1 - 9 player arcade slalom skiing game for the Atari.\n\nThe player must ski down a steep slope, attempting to cross through all the marked gates.

You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeZ6zi9XmY","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Activision, Inc.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":"1984-08-01T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"811668de-9496-44b1-ab3c-471cee2ae9b8.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"9e876ed7-f5b4-40e1-bd79-efb01ee14837.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"bf41dc29-8faa-42d9-a540-9d143b8206cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"132ba636-3ba2-4129-8f59-c814e60fa802.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"fbddc6a2-f794-4555-9713-18b2e7d88c79.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"144a1eea-0373-48fc-adfd-bf9a147ccee4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"633b0470-66db-4fa4-8d55-70ee267c5bfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185680,"FileName":"73fb48ab-3303-4b01-819b-70a88957d6bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200368,"Name":"H3x0r deluxe","ReleaseYear":"2010","Overview":"h3x0r 1k was created for MiniGame compo 2009, it is hexagonal gem swapping game (similar to Bejewelled) that use selfchanging code to fit into 1024 bytes.\n\nh3x0r deluxe is deluxe edition of same game, it was finished in 2010 and won 3rd place in ABBUC sw contest 2010.\n\nTo play, place the cursor over a gem, click then move to an adjacent gem that you want to swap with, and click.

Both of them drop constantly and need to be refilled with the appropriate pickups. Occasionally, small tracked mines will randomly drive onto the screen; colliding with them drains both energy meters quickly. If either energy meter reaches zero, the game is over.

Transports could carry either colonists and troops and traders carried metal or food surpluses to where they were needed. During an invasion, the respective armies from each player would fight until one force was destroyed. However, planets thus captured could suffer from guerrilla resistance for several turns and if not eradicated could overthrow the invaders or assist your opponent's armies in the event of a counter invasion.\n\nGiven the tiny systems it ran on, this game did a very good job of simulating many important considerations, and was the first introduction of some of the things that have become staples in 4X space games; most notably ship design and refits.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196477,"Name":"In Search of the Most Amazing Thing","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Your uncle, Smoke Bailey, was a great adventurer and explorer.

It was widely lauded by reviewers, and became a major seller for Sierra Online. The story of its creation forms a portion of Steven Levy's book, Hackers.\n\n\n\nJawbreaker is essentially a Pac-Man clone, in that a small yellow set of jaws is moved around the map to pick up small dots while avoiding the \"jawbreakers\" which roll around the map. If the jaws bite the jawbreaker, they will be destroyed and the player will lose a life. It was released for the Atari 8-bit.\n\n\n\nAdvertisements claimed that \"Kids Protest Maze Games\", allegedly complaining about \"tedious and outdated computer maze games\". Jawbreaker, the company promised, differed by having the entire screen move, \"even the walls\".\n\n\n\nJohn Harris also developed and released ports of the game for the Atari 2600 under Tigervision (1982), and the Apple II (1981) under On-Line Systems. A game by the same name for the Commodore 64 was released in 1983, but coded by Doug Whittaker and Chuck Bueche and bore little resemblance to the original version.[3] An IBM PC version was also available.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"John Harris","Publisher":"On-Line Systems","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":123538,"FileName":"d22a41e7-e5c6-41f9-9fda-91d08e8d1bbd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123538,"FileName":"9bb42eaf-a0ff-43a0-b523-0b391b87e8fc.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":123538,"FileName":"f178acb6-9658-4569-9089-b65109aefff6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":123538,"FileName":"8f14dd00-a531-40a7-b28b-67a8afccfc0a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":123538,"AlternateName":"Jaw Breaker","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":194739,"Name":"Jawbreaker II","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Unlike the Apple II and Atari 8-bit versions, the Commodore 64 and TI-99/4A versions of Jawbreaker are not Pac-Man clones.

With this done his housekeeper Maria will let him go to bed. Willy's mansion was bought with the wealth obtained from his adventures in Manic Miner but much of it remains unexplored and it appears to be full of strange creatures, possibly a result of the previous (missing) owner's experiments. Willy must explore the enormous mansion and its grounds (including a beach and a yacht) to fully tidy up the house so he can get some much-needed sleep. \n\nJet Set Willy is a flip-screen platform game in which the player moves the protagonist, Willy, from room to room in his mansion collecting objects. Unlike the screen-by-screen style of its prequel, the player can explore the mansion at will. Willy is controlled using only left, right and jump. He can climb stairs by walking into them (jumping through them to avoid them) and climb swinging ropes by pushing left or right depending on what direction the rope is swinging. The play area itself consists of 60 playable screens making up the mansion and its grounds and contains hazards (static killer objects), guardians (killer monsters which move along predetermined paths), various platforms and collectable objects. The collectable items glow to distinguish them from other objects in the room.\n\nWilly loses a life if he touches an enemy or falls too far, and he is returned to the point at which he entered the room. This may lead to a game-ending situation in which Willy repeatedly falls from a height, losing all lives in succession.\n\nOne of the more bizarrely named rooms in the game is We Must Perform A Quirkafleeg.[1] (The pre-release name for the screen was The Gaping Pit.)[2] This is a reference to the comic strip Fat Freddy's Cat, a spin-off from the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers; in the original comic, the quirkafleeg was an obscure ritual in a foreign country, required to be performed upon the sight of dead furry animals.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnNn-Ixpv_Y","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Mark Riddell","Publisher":"Tynesoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158028,"FileName":"b20efcd3-ee48-43b5-8802-ef950254fd4e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":158028,"FileName":"67d49eac-2562-4858-a61c-03d3036c4ca6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":158028,"FileName":"1dcef1d7-d268-44e9-a34d-7c1d523e8726.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122101,"Name":"Jet-Boot Jack","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Music notes have escaped throughout the world, and Jet-Boot Jack must collect them up.

Taito released a re-skinned version of the game as Pirate Pete. In the Atari-ported versions the hero is named Sir Dudley, and the girl, married to Sir Dudley, is Lady Penelope.\n\nAtari published home ports under their own brand for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 8-bit family. The rest were released under the Atarisoft label: Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC (as a PC booter), and TI-99/4A.

Players take the role of nobles in the Holy Roman Empire and compete for the crown of the emperor.\n\nOne to nine players can play, beginning by entering their name and gender and being assigned a state in the empire. Gameplay then takes place in turns, each consisting of a number of consecutive screens. In the first screen, players can sell and buy grain and land. Grain is necessary to feed a noble's subjects. Bad weather can result in harvest losses, making it necessary to buy extra grain to prevent starvation. Providing more grain than necessary increases population growth and the state's reputation. Acquiring more land increases population and is necessary for economic growth. Following the trading screen is a statistics screen, displaying births and deaths, immigration and emigration as well as income and expenses.\n\nThe third screen allows control of income. Players can set taxes and tariffs and can determine how harshly the justice system works - setting it to a level that is too brutal might increase income in the short term but also lead to increased emigration. Another overview screen follows, displaying a player's lands and properties in detail.\n\nThe fifth screen allows for spending the turn's income. It is possible to buy marketplaces and grain mills (both of which increase income) as well as construct part of a palace or a cathedral (both of which have no direct use but are required to move into the highest levels of nobility). Each building option requires owning a certain amount of land. Constructing five marketplaces and three mills results in the creation of a city.\n\nOnly if there is more than one player in the game, income can also be spent on military expenses. Soldiers can be recruited from the own population or hired as mercenaries. Recruitment is limited by population size, while mercenaries cost more, but are more skilled from the start. Infantry, cavalry and artillery units are available. Military exercises can be conducted to increase the troops' experience. Finally, troops can be sent to war by selecting another player to attack. Only geographical neighbors can be attacked directly - if other states are in the way, their regents have to be asked for right of passage. All other players besides the two fighting parties are asked if they want to support either of the two. If a party gains the support of another noble, they are allowed to control the supporting player's troops in the battle. The actual battle is fought automatically, but both parties can place their troops on a map of the defending player's lands beforehand. The victor of a battle gains land from the loser.\n\nAt the end of a turn, interest on the money reserves (or the debt) is calculated and players move ahead in the ranks of the nobility if certain winning conditions are met. Higher ranks increase the debt limit and allow players to be more demanding in setting taxes. Becoming emperor requires moving through all ranks, owning five cities, a palace and a cathedral, 25.000 hectares of land and 100.000 thalers of money.\n\nThe game has a built-in time limitation. At the start of the game, all players are given a set date of death. This is the same for all players, but if players take more than 90 seconds for their turns, the date might move ahead, shortening their game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Ariolasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195161,"FileName":"843fab70-6772-4282-b303-5dd30a083300.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":195161,"FileName":"af10a866-79ab-467f-a324-15e391819a1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Germany"},{"DatabaseID":195161,"FileName":"9f4e7ebe-c162-442b-8bf1-b576f84bc876.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Germany"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197396,"Name":"Kaiv","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin.

The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures.\n\nYou explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like \"MOVE NORTH\" or \"LIGHT TORCH\". The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move several squares at once (like \"MOVE EAST 3\") to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is \"SPEED\", which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires.\n\nThe combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Screenplay","Publisher":"Screenplay","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197396,"FileName":"e714dc7c-d8c8-4623-a975-b1b7d0416f91.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":197396,"FileName":"4123492c-1a8b-4954-9ac6-ecef944b74e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197396,"FileName":"a62aed7e-9c3c-4d5a-98d0-b046d4e22165.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199333,"Name":"Kamikaze","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Star Gazer Enterprises","ReleaseDate":"2021-02-06T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197519,"Name":"Kampania Wrzesniowa","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Kampania wrześniowa (September Campaign) takes place during the invasion of Poland in 1939, marking the beginning of the World War 2.\n\nThe goal is to capture enemy headquarters.

Most of the aliens are in stasis. Left to themselves, they will slowly but randomly materialize from one of the eight transportation beams that terminate just above the planet's surface. Once they arrive, these spacecraft will make a kamikaze dive at your command ship. The alien kritters from these transport beams are impervious to your normal weapons, and must be avoided. Instead of waiting for the ships to arrive, you can activate them at a more convenient time by firing on them. Kritters from higher up in each beam are able to maneuver more quickly, and are much more likely to crash into you.\n\nIn addition to the menace from the transporter beams, there are free falling kritters. These slowly fall straight down from the top of the screen, and may be shot. They will destroy you if they run into you, and if they slip past your defences will cause you to lose points from your score. Both free falling and transported kritters are worth more points if shot higher up the screen.\n\nYou start the game with three command ships. Up to five extra command ships may be awarded by killing alien patrol kritters which occasionally move from right to left across the very top of the screen. Removing all aliens from the screen takes you to the next skill level (which ranges from zero to nine). Each level increases the number and speed of the free falling kritters but also provides you with an extra super-missile. Activating super-missiles allow you to destroy one of the normally invulnerable aliens from the transport beams.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"CBS Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194594,"FileName":"249da4f2-8463-454d-b8d2-ce57c0e61428.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":194594,"FileName":"2ccf7166-d1ff-4fbe-b4c7-e6789f7fde56.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":194594,"FileName":"e38f8359-87f9-467f-92a3-e8b3d8a8c05e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199184,"Name":"Krazy Mazes","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"From A.N.A.L.O.G. magazine issue 71.\n\nKrazy Mazes features two different kinds of competitive maze games.

This multi-scenario action game is an analogy of a person's life experiences, from the cradle to the grave, with the ultimate objective of leading the longest, fullest life possible.\n\n\nEach game begins with the birth spiral screen, wherein the player is treated to a pretty light sequence. While waiting for the fetus to \"develop\", the gamer can move the joystick in any direction to add musical tones to the birth chorus.\n\n\nGradually, the birth spiral fades away and the player becomes an infant in a playpen. The object of this screen is to isolate as many personality traits as possible (there are four altogether) to become as well-rounded a person as possible. To do this, garners move building blocks around the screen with their cursor, dropping the blocks near the corners of the playpen, thus keeping the free-bouncing personality traits from escaping. The more traits trapped, the sooner opportunities come knocking later and the longer the player's lifespan.\n\n\nThe third screen brings the gamer's character to the threshold of adulthood - the opportunity gates. The gates are actually a dark, forbidding corridor filled with tiny points of light.\n\n\nDepending on the character traits trapped in early childhood, perfect and not-so-perfect opportunities whiz by on the screen. The best opportunities are those that look exactly like the player's character trait. Those with similar shapes but different colors (or colored alike but differently shaped) are decent opportunities, while those bearing no resemblance are the worst choices. The object of the screen is to locate the right opportunity, then enter it by passing through the center of its spiral.\n\n\nSuccessfully entering an opportunity leads to the next scenario, situations and conversations. Unsuccessful tries have a negative effect on the gamer's health. This screen is an analogy to the social process, in which players must make contact with common interests (depicted as colored squares on the grid) in order to enter conversations with their peers. This must be done while avoiding creatures that rob the gamer of common interests. When enough common interests have been acquired and the player successfully joins a conversation, it's time for the most dangerous screen of all - the experience corridor.\n\n\nHurtling through the corridor at lightning speed, the player has to steer clear of the dark Worries, Fears and Doubts that threaten the health of the character. Large, bright lights are Hopes, which can reverse some of the debilitating effects of failure. If the player is strong enough to cope with life experiences, he or she is rewarded with an extra character dimension and a beautifully animated Insight before returning to the earlier screens to continue play.\n\n\nThe real payoff comes at the end in the form of a brilliant sound and light show, the electronic version of one's life flashing before his eyes. The better the player, the more spectacular the finale.\nIt's impossible to detail all the intricacies of the game in just one review. But it's a refreshing change to see a game that emphasizes aesthetics above scoring, without sacrificing a iota of playability in the process. John O'Neill, artist turned game designer, has succeeded in what he set out to do - to produce a great game that appeals to the psyche as well as the trigger finger.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Unreleased","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Roklan","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":199821,"FileName":"710de770-1b67-4445-8e7a-ae148cd939c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":199821,"FileName":"89ca359c-6bba-4724-a7bd-6cdbcfabab4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":199821,"FileName":"326e8097-64dd-45b5-9925-8faca6f21f2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":199821,"FileName":"39356d6d-1e1c-4a87-b910-df0087596276.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":199821,"FileName":"57faa08f-fd0f-48df-ac45-48073421dc31.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":199821,"FileName":"e74223cd-492e-4f6a-b22b-ffa60eca69c0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198866,"Name":"Liga Polska","ReleaseYear":"1995","Overview":"Liga Polska is a football management game.

In practice, this requires the player to direct the carpet over diamond-shaped gates as they appear; failure to do so returns the prince to the beginning of the tunnel.\n\nOnce in the den, the second mode, the player strikes a gong thrice to summon the genie. The genie draws from a hookah, and blows out a ball of smoke. From the smoke emerges a sequence of tones, which the player must repeat in a call-and-response pattern. In order to play a tone, the player must strike the corresponding gong. If the player strikes the incorrect gong, or strikes the correct gong too early, the genie's magic transports the prince to the beginning of the tunnel.\n\nIn the seven dens of the first genie, each tone is audible, and manifests as a colored quaver (eighth note) that floats toward the ground. In the seven dens of the second genie, the tone is inaudible, so the player must match the color of the note to the color of the corresponding gong. In the seven dens of the third genie, the tone is audible, but no note appears; the player must recognize the note's pitch, and strike the correct gong. When the player passes the trial, a gateway to another tunnel opens.\n\nAfter passing the musical trials of the three genies, the player navigates one final tunnel to the palace. If the player succeeds, the prince reclaims the palace.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Koi8zRtcvDs","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Activision","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":139769,"FileName":"d770150e-baaa-4f51-988b-a48e491aabfb.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":139769,"FileName":"91fe892a-71c1-46e8-a2b2-1744423eddd5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":139769,"FileName":"476c9509-bd0f-4833-9256-fb9b3d8dcd68.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139769,"FileName":"ca56a19e-8004-42be-9a25-170ea1795af1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139769,"FileName":"869aed34-b8af-4e4b-a51b-e5798c2e3855.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":139769,"FileName":"2bfe719a-bd48-43e4-8a31-6ab29bcc5119.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198130,"Name":"MasterMatch","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":"Chuck Mullally","Publisher":"APX","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194947,"Name":"Masters of Time","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Masters of Time is an educational quiz game for multiple systems.\n\nAll of Earth's history has been lost.

The titular MiG Alley was the area over North Korea near the Chinese border where the world's first large-scale jet-to-jet air battles took place, with, among others, the American F-86 Sabre facing off against the Soviet MiG-15 Fagot. The game is similar to MicroProse's earlier simulations Hellcat Ace and Spitfire Ace. MiG Alley Ace differs in that it offers a two-player mode via split screen. Five different scenarios based on actual encounters from the war are available. Each can be played solo, cooperatively or head-to-head. The goal in each scenario is to shoot down as many of the enemy planes as possible before the own squadron is destroyed. If a player's plane is destroyed but other craft from their squadron remain, they take control over one of the surviving planes. A scenario can result in a victory or loss for either side (or a neutral result in case the time limit expires). What the result is depends on a number of factors - while a destroyed enemy plane always nets victory points, the enemy might not be punished for it if the pilot bailed out or ditched the plane. Losing a scenario deducts from the player's lives: too many losses means the game has to be restarted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194456,"FileName":"660f48e3-e6d0-40af-a520-1e9bb14267a5.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194456,"FileName":"770cd932-f720-48f1-af44-a026fa9365b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":194456,"FileName":"2aee20e5-767d-4783-ad08-d24a32de4a70.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":194456,"FileName":"8c2b574d-0511-44d1-ab1d-f920f7902ea9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":194456,"FileName":"eb568339-fd2f-4c0e-9519-4dfe88132a52.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194456,"FileName":"f061bab0-26cd-42dd-aa0e-56fd5c2f161b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195546,"Name":"Milk Race","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The Milk Race involved cycling 1000 miles across Britain, and the game simulates being one of the 84 entrants.

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze.

For a first-timer in the big city, Ed will run into some problems, namely the traffic. There are two types of vehicles that Ed must face. There are harmless cars cruising the streets, and these cars can be run over without taking any damage to yourself. There are also tow trucks that can easily damage your Plymouth. If it takes enough damaged or it runs out of gas, then it is hauled to the garage while you are recovering in the hospital. You must hot-foot it all the way to the garage to pick up your car and fork out $100 for repairs. If you run out of money, the game is over.\n\nHowever, you are free to visit the bank to get some more. If you do this, then you need to avoid a series of bank robbers, who constantly fire at you and prevent you from reaching the teller on the opposite side. If you manage to reach the teller, then you are awarded $500 and the teller will close.\n\nYour main objective is to visit two of the buildings, as indicated in your status bar. (Only two buildings are open at once.) To view a site, you must find a parking space close by, get out of the car, and walk into the building. Each building contains a mini-game that must be completed before it can be deemed as 'seen'. Meanwhile, your car is metered, and if the parking meter expires, then it is towed away to the lot and you have to make your way to the lot to pick it up. The whole game must be completed in a day.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMTGqlJLgHM","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Russ Segal","Publisher":"Synapse Software Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"fdcec67d-c193-44f2-a82b-8fe6b1e793b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"0ebc86f7-f321-4aca-815c-51969eac33d7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"815714a0-4e79-42bf-abf8-829430fdf37e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"e2b13587-ada5-4973-b774-977ad89a72b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"47316647-1740-4d92-9d57-77ca45ae24af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"dec2e282-6bf6-4ff3-adea-a99b03de5801.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"a66009f8-f763-442e-8ce9-f060c5f6bde8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"70981362-5dce-4340-a8f8-25cea65c911f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"263b4de7-7bbe-4f16-884d-ae25547ec57e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"7c2bc3ed-edef-4c3d-bbfe-8e58640bdd7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":171432,"FileName":"681e1d37-5b0e-4b16-9513-79f3c91f942f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":171432,"AlternateName":"New York City: The Big Apple","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":198864,"Name":"Nexus","ReleaseYear":"1996","Overview":"Nexus is a simple FPP labyrinth game.

Apart from other ninjas there are also indestructible, moving obstacles and other enemies including golems, worms and birds.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_0SI3NUrac","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Zeppelin Games","Publisher":"Zeppelin Games","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"e764d096-9690-41a3-9a6e-48d4e3cc7a5f.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"59388a35-c823-4099-8488-7bccb000e3cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"f6ad9948-c43d-4db8-af4c-eb797ed4b76c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"47cf6277-3567-4f0c-ae8b-c5443c8cecd9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"a8841384-641f-40b5-89ca-31326f98aa6b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"6d3802c5-ab80-4f5d-9cbf-6ba6b696bcbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196570,"FileName":"46afbfb3-adaf-4238-817e-29a84b6c26c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195394,"Name":"Ninja Master","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Ninja Master combines four small sub games into one.\n\nYou are a trainee ninja. You want to impress your peers and become a true ninja. The time for the annual games has come around and you must compete and succeed at these games to achieve your goal. The games consist of four tests:\n\nTest 1: The arrow test\nArrows fly at you from off-screen, both right and left, high, middle and low. You must stop them hitting you by punching or kicking the arrow, so not only do you have to hit the right key, you have to do it at just the right time.\n\nTest 2: Breaking a block of wood\nTwo keys are designated 'Right power' and 'Left power'. You must hit these alternately to build up as much power as you can within a time limit. With enough power the wood breaks and the crowd cheers.\n\nTest 3: The Shuriken star test\nSimilar to the arrow test, stars fly at you from off-screen and must be blocked by hitting the right key at the right time. However the starts travel faster and, 'coz you're using your ninja sword and not your fist & feet, you have greater range so there's less time to react.\n\nTest 4: The blow dart test\nHere you must use a blow-gun to hit targets.\n\nIn all tests there is a qualifying score and you have three attempts to beat that score. Succeed and you progress on to the next test. Fail and it's back to the beginning.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Tron Software","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"9d555fa5-ba3e-4596-9a85-5382740f3e4f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"372281bb-9798-4bb6-bb1d-85ace8ceb8f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"fb61a7f4-a425-4672-a684-cd856ba988a2.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"724ccc80-3d2a-4950-8b92-877e8e187708.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"530090b1-a86c-4e3c-ac61-aeb0b61cc801.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"68aaddcf-dc0f-46b7-bb9a-ea3db4b1c71e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195394,"FileName":"108647dd-785d-460d-a4d5-486ef344455b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199769,"Name":"Nordic Ski","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Len Dorfman","Publisher":"Len Dorfman","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200990,"Name":"North Atlantic Convoy Raider","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"It is May 8, 1941 and you are Captain of the mighty German battleship Bismarck the single most powerful ship in the Atlantic.

It was created by William G M Leslie and Thomas R Carbone. The first version was programmed in valFORTH on an Atari 800, based on a board game created by Leslie. It was Omnitrend's first game. \n\nThe game starts off on the planet Axia within the Local Group, a settlement that took place centuries ago thanks to the discovery of an alien hyperspace booster. This technology allowed the Local Group to be settled with supplies being sent from Earth using the booster. However, the supplies have stopped arriving and the player must now search for a second hyperspace booster that was reported in the area.\n\nThe game begins with a loan from the bank to finance a spaceship. Several models are available and offer different capabilities and cargo space.

The speed of the game tended to bog down when graphics were involved and when the game performed calculations involving orbital mechanics.

Each level starts with you at ground level, where you have to make a quick decision as to where should you go to start digging, because straight at the bottom of the long narrow hole, a pile of dynamite is about to blow up, which will result in water flooding up the tunnels you are about to make. Your mission is to collect every bit of treasure scattered all over the limited area, but the constantly rising water acts as your timer, but it will only rise as far up as your tunnels allow it. So, in essence, it's a race against physics. To make things a bit trickier, the game will not allow you to mine more than one block's worth in any direction, but then again, you won't be able to get trapped under falling bits of ground. As an additional inconvenience, there are some roaming underground enemies trying to catch you, but being a seasoned prospector that you are, of course you have armed yourself with a few sticks of dynamite. The speed of monsters and water changes with the level of play, up to a point, so the game does offer a good deal of challenge.\n\nLike countless other arcade-style games of the time, O'Riley's Mine can be played by two players, but you will be taking turns, so the idea of fun there is shortlived. You also have the option to start the game from any of the first nine levels, so the more advanced players will not get bored as quickly. Still, it is an old-school arcade game at heart, so it does not have any long-term replay value to it, even with all the progressive difficult levels and two-player options and whatnot. It's just harmless bit of fun, with a couple of nice twists to it that make it stand out, and I can only recommend it as good way to waste your coffee break.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/1ygy55S1rfY?t=7","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Mark Riley","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188124,"FileName":"7aba0374-5a70-41d7-9f99-c540dfd0c4a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":188124,"FileName":"3ac57eb5-33b8-4936-8de4-adc4d0ee6048.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":188124,"FileName":"f9ab8976-4363-4c72-996d-db00f25606d7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199889,"Name":"Othello (Stack Computer Services)","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Stack Computer Services","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196112,"Name":"Outlaw","ReleaseYear":"1979","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"APX","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196939,"Name":"Outris","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Outris is a Tetris variant for two players in split-screen mode.

The most basic enemies can move one step at a time in a specific direction, while others make the opposite move of the player. So if the player moves north, the enemy moves south. Some enemies matches the player's move but turn them a certain amount of degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. Another enemy moves like a chess knight and jumps to a non-adjacent square via an L-shaped path.\n\nThe game has two play modes; practice and tournament. In the practice mode the player creates his own selection of enemies to play against while in the tournament mode he plays pre-made levels.

Fuel may be replenished by destroying certain bases that appear regularly throughout the cavern. Once you have reached the bottom of the cavern, the control centre, which is defended by a concrete bunker, must be destroyed. This ends the level, and your mission restarts at a higher level.

The game puts you in control of Pinhead the clown, a pointy-headed unicyclist, who is riding on a tightrope along the bottom of the screen. Above him are rows of balloons, which fall toward the ground at different speeds depending on their color. You must maneuver Pinhead under the balloon, so that it lands on, and is popped by, his pointy hat. If you miss a balloon, and it hits the tightrope, the vibration will knock Pinhead off the rope to an unseen demise below.\n\nYour only chance if you miss a balloon, is to kick it back up in the air. Pressing the button on the joystick control will cause Pinhead to kick. Successful kicking, however, requires a great deal of practice, and is far more difficult than popping a balloon. After several rounds, other objects also begin to drop. These include such items as keys, candy canes and umbrellas. They can be caught and kicked, just like balloons, and they are worth many more points. The most dangerous object that falls is a bucket. Unlike other objects, kicking the bucket results in the loss of one of your five lives, so it must be caught on your head and popped immediately.\n\nPinhead is one of those rare games that doesn't become easy or boring as you get better. Instead it actually becomes more challenging and much more fun. The higher the level you reach, the more interesting the objects you get to see, and the faster the demand on your reflexes.\n\nPinhead is not a \"serious\" video game; it doesn't ask you to save mankind. It lets you just have fun being a clown and popping balloons. This attitude is evident throughout the game, from the light music in the background to the cute intermission displays between rounds. This is the perfect game for someone who wants to have a little fun.\n\nTo be successful in this game, kicking is a must. I would advise spending a round in which you try to kick everything in order to master the art.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Robert Jaeger","Publisher":"Utopia Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194830,"FileName":"3a51109b-73da-49fa-ac97-20b6d30529da.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":194830,"FileName":"efc8cfde-1e86-4212-aebb-e82797235e18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":194830,"FileName":"33dd5196-2909-4fbb-8620-b6ac91b9595f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195125,"Name":"Pipeline","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Preliminary version of Juice!.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Arti Haroutunian","Publisher":"Tronix","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195125,"FileName":"f519eb87-d208-4e1f-8936-cbb26b28fc29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195125,"FileName":"6416e95b-dcac-4c8b-b834-11eedbba3572.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198229,"Name":"Piranha","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"ALA Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":118244,"Name":"Pirate Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Published by Adventure International and the second game of the series, after Adventureland, this text-based adventure game was one of many adventure games created by Scott Adams, in this case based on his wife Alexis' ideas.

Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Epyx, Inc.","Publisher":"Epyx, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166244,"FileName":"9105a87e-b449-47a5-8eb9-00bbcd9f226f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166244,"FileName":"ae6c843f-5bcd-4447-b69a-ea6a9aba6a95.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166244,"FileName":"37e8561c-4076-4a5b-be5b-e2b821d2ecfa.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166244,"FileName":"54518753-4f5a-401a-9947-b127d9452a02.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166244,"FileName":"5c815698-3717-4e3b-84b4-ace1ae81708b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166244,"FileName":"37fe29ab-462b-46ba-baa2-c706d57fdc04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195213,"Name":"Pitstop II","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Race Formula-1 in several tracks while trying to beat a computer, or human opponent.

It was also the first game to feature a qualifying lap, requiring the player to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. Once the player has qualified, they must complete the race in the time allowed, avoiding collisions with CPU-controlled opponents and billboards along the sides of the track. The game's publisher Atari publicized the game for its \"unbelievable driving realism\" in providing a Formula 1 experience behind a racing wheel. The game's graphics featured full-colour landscapes with scaling sprites, including race cars and other signs, and a pseudo-3D, third-person, rear perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpfNIaN9ES8","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Namco Limited","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"54161320-4461-4c22-8e19-44475d246741.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"2ac79f05-15eb-4ffe-9cac-add47b7636bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"391467fe-b64a-4600-8087-86f1522007c4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"d61b6197-84eb-4f0a-b49c-f40f526ee82f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"f0894291-7a42-48f7-9c07-08a41c8a43c3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"ae5e726b-bc1d-4e2c-8627-643255fbf27d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"d31d2121-7d8e-448f-9644-19daa0918440.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"5e936777-0db8-4cad-a7e1-9d9281ae0cbc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":158025,"FileName":"3ae1f675-f9c7-4c2f-881c-a5a3c7872b96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199703,"Name":"Pondering About Max's","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Pondering About Max's is a highly unusual and rare game for the Atari 8-bit.

If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.

If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_eZPyK5apU","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Datasoft, Inc.","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"ad16e1c6-f89d-472e-8591-9df75276bbfb.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"9be8209b-f68f-4ad8-b8a8-caa03adcf20f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"dff9323c-ec28-46a7-a373-8fb4e38e57d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"a7ed8e5c-180c-4e88-9382-dd0a376c1974.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"1b70039c-1233-4cc1-a2c7-43e0b77a290d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"2bf424a8-6483-4faa-b720-5e098a5c8280.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"2142aa00-eaf3-4ec5-8666-c8f8e7cb87a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"f7e42288-c4b8-4b6e-81fc-4e7d954e6c42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"65249a86-0181-4be0-be19-ca70c4197df0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187770,"FileName":"c588112c-188d-4a6d-b77b-7d7af675a90b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198960,"Name":"Popcorn!","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"ANALOG Computing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":193838,"Name":"Popeye","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"As Popeye, you are trying to win Olive Oyl's love!

After barely escaping his banishment retrieving balls from a golf course of hellish design in Preppie!, Wadsworth must now compete in a new challenge to advance to the next level of fraternity consideration.\n\nWadsworth is armed with a cloak which makes him invulnerable to enemy attack for a a limited period of time each level. Each level of difficulty consists of 3 rooms separated by a doorway. The goal is to walk over all areas of the map to turn them purple. When all squares are colored in all 3 rooms, the player advances to the next level. Room 1 and 3 features frogs which continuously try to hop towards the player. They can be avoided by using spinning doors to block the frogs' path. The 2nd room features several horizontal passageways, from which lawnmowers continuously scroll from the left or the right.

Where have I seen a game start this way before? No matter -- though its theme and trappings are strangely reminiscent of certain licensed popular contemporary videogame properties, the gameplay soon goes off in a direction all its own. This hunchback, for instance, can fight back -- grabbing a rock from a nearby pile he handily hurls it down at the intruder, knocking him off his ladder. But another is set up, and another... soon Quasimodo is singlehandedly fending off a veritable siege, tossing rocks left, right, down and to the lower diagonals as squirming masses of bad guys return fire with arrows that bounce off the walls! Yet as soon as it began... all is quiet once more, your sole companion an endlessly-flapping bat (who kills you should he absentmindedly drift into your path).\n\nThe game shifts gears here, the joystick's action button switching duties from rock-lobbing to jumping. No other humans will be seen for quite some time as you scurry up ladders and swing yourself across ropes dangling from massive ceiling-mounted bells, all in pursuit of gleaming gems to deposit in basement altars. Every time you do so another area of the game will be opened up, and you get to undertake the grand circuit once more -- again fending off the ladder-climbers, swinging across the same pits (the only time you enjoy bat-immunity, though they don't make any conscious effort to seek out your close company), dodging the same bats (the flock increased by an extra bat each time through). At the very pinnacle of your medieval structure you will have to climb a sheer wall face while dodging (and returning) arrows shot by archers in the window and (now the tables are turned!) boulders rolled down from the parapets. (Parapets? This, then, is no Notre-Dame!) And then the gem is got, and back down again, and so forth and so on; the cycle turns on, endless labour without even a rumour of beloved Esmeralda!

In the first Questron game, the player takes on the role of a young serf who tries to make a name for himself by traveling the realm in order to gain the power and experience necessary to defeat the wicked \"Mantor\", ruler of the \"Land of Evil\". The view is mostly in top-down style for the world maps and town encounters, but switches to a 3D first-person style in the dungeons of the Land of Evil. Some features were novel for a game of its type at the time of its release. First there are two \"games within a game\" that allow the character to permanently increase dexterity or intelligence attributes if completed successfully. Also, various casinos about the towns allow the player to gamble for gold pieces in games of blackjack, roulette and double or nothing. The moral tone of the game is unusual. You can rob and kill merchants, and to progress in the game to the Land of Evil you must storm a castle and kill the guards. The king of that castle will knight you for your courage. Another aspect of the game is that various monsters and foes are immune or more vulnerable to different weapons. The player would occasionally have to switch weapons depending on which enemy they faced in order to defeat them. Magic spells can also be cast, but only in the dungeon levels. The original game was written by Charles Dougherty and Gerald Wieczorek and published in 1984 for the Atari 800, Commodore 64, and Apple II computer systems. After an out-of-court settlement, the structure and style of the game were both officially licensed from Richard Garriott, author of Akalabeth and Ultima.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"John C.

The game was ported to the Atari 8-bit, and Commodore 64. The player controls a fighter ship sent to stop a fleet of invading aliens from building an attack base on the planet Repton. The ship is equipped with lasers and a limited number of nukes that can destroy all enemies on the screen. The player can use an invulnerable shield for defense, but cannot steer or fire while it is up. If the player puts the shield up while moving, the ship will coast to a stop. In addition, a radar screen indicates the location of enemies on the planet surface. Each level of the game is played in two parts. During the surface attack, the player fights enemies in order to delay the construction of the base. \"Warning\" messages indicate that a fresh wave of enemies is arriving, while an \"Alert\" tells of an attempt to siphon energy from the planet. If the player can fly through the enemy's energy beam in time, then pass through a charging station, the energy will be returned to the planet; otherwise, it will go into building the base. Once the base is completed, the planet's defenses trigger a bomb that destroys the entire surface and the action shifts to the underground caverns, where the radar does not function. Here, the player must dodge enemy attacks and eventually destroy the base's power core, after which the next level begins with increased difficulty.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Dan Thompson","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":194174,"FileName":"79822c15-3b50-4b79-8169-7bfcf4ff4ad2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":194174,"FileName":"d303abf7-2aa6-4811-be20-536a181c35a9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":194174,"FileName":"7b59d1c8-14fb-42f3-9e19-900b3db23023.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":194174,"FileName":"6fb205b0-79c4-47a8-a2d1-a0fe0112ea89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":194174,"FileName":"dcd40692-a609-49b6-aad8-09d3eda6396e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199369,"Name":"Rescue Adventure","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"CodeWriter","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196563,"Name":"Rescue at Rigel","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"In Rescue at Rigel, you take the part of Sudden Smith, a human adventurer teleported down by transporter beam inside a six-floor, sixty-room complex inhabited by an alien race, the Tollah.

Your archenemy, Greedo the goblin, has kidnapped your sweet baby Iggy and\nholds him captive in his creepy caves. He’s put Iggy in a trance, and your only hope of rescuing the baby is to get medicine from three medicine pots\nand then touch him. To get medicine from a pot, land on it. Meanwhile, Greedo is throwing deadly arrows at you. The best way to avoid them is\nusually to move up and hover while they fly by. Sometimes, though, there’s no room to maneuver, so you must use careful timing to get through the tight spots.\n\nYou control Igneous with a joystick. To move left or right, push the stick in that direction. If you go off the screen on one side, you'll reappear on the other. To move up, hold the fire button down and push the stick forward. Pressing the trigger turns on a mechanism that lets you hover at a constant altitude. If you push the stick forward, you are propelled upward. You need to push the stick each time you want to move up one space.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"J.

Otherwise the game remains essentially the same as the original.\n\nYou awaken in a sealed wing of the Count's Transylvanian castle, seemingly restrictive but yielding further avenues of secret passages and unexpected exits to the intrepid and timely explorer. Over the course of a few days you need to cultivate a familiarity with the layout of the castle and the nocturnal activities of its primary resident, who chooses to make midnight snacks of you rather than a main course. An unpredictable day/night cycle forces your hand, necessitating finding a reliable light source and some means of staying awake -- or else you awaken the next morning back in bed, your possessions pilfered by the kleptomaniacal creature of the night and your neck boasting irritated bite marks.

It models a pressurized water reactor (PWR) called 'Silicon Valley Nuclear Power Station Unit 2', resembling the name and operation of Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown in March 1979. \n\nWritten in Atari BASIC, SCRAM uses differential equations to simulate reactor behavior. The player controls the valves and switches of a nuclear reactor directly with the joystick.\n\nThis game's title, SCRAM, is taken from the nuclear reactor safe-word conceived at the University of Chicago in 1942. It stands for \"Start Cutting Right Away, Man\", and it refers to cutting a reactor's control rods so they fall into the nuclear material and stop the reaction process. The game also recreates the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear reactor, and allowed players to recreate the events that took place there in 1979.\n\nThe game display consists of a schematic-like representation of a light water reactor. The reactor core is on the left of the screen, with the primary coolant loop to its immediate right. Further right is the secondary cooling loop, and finally the tertiary cooling loop and its associated cooling tower.\n\nThe user interacts with the game by moving the joystick, which makes a cursor jump from one \"hot spot\" to another on the screen, each one controlling one part of the reactor systems. There are hot spots for the control rods, cooling pumps and valves. The user can experiment with the reactor systems by moving the joystick up and down, operating the equipment. It is possible to simulate a meltdown by shutting off the primary cooling pumps and withdrawing the control rods all the way.\n\nThe game has several skill levels, which control the frequency of earthquakes and the obviousness of the damage. In the event of an earthquake the screen shakes, and a breaking sound is heard if there is damage. The user then has to watch the on-screen displays to try to isolate the problem.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy","Developer":"Chris Crawford","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156386,"FileName":"4d8fbdb1-4be1-4977-8f1f-0f3e92957ce2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":156386,"FileName":"d6d1dbd4-0a0c-4f3e-9d7a-c748f693a1aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":156386,"FileName":"35646997-2557-4194-ac63-5800f597db16.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156386,"FileName":"8d9e8a19-9589-4158-9bf7-1b88393d332b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156386,"FileName":"5367e4d7-8722-4a95-b18b-2a2bfa20bebc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156386,"FileName":"3bfc0534-1c66-493f-8ba1-6caf1ef63baa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156386,"AlternateName":"Centrale Nucleaire","Region":"France"}]},{"DatabaseID":201261,"Name":"Scramble","ReleaseYear":"2018","Overview":"Scramble is a high quality port of the original arcade game to Atari 8-bit.

Press the fire button to launch missiles and drop bombs (configurable from the options screen, if the setting is not \"both\" use space bar to drop bombs). Points are scored for traveling a certain distance and destroying enemy installations. Additional fuel is gained by destroying the fuel tanks.

The map shows the location of enemy warships, planets, bases, and locations to resupply. The player can place beacons, which allows them to find enemy merchant vessels. When the player destroys enemy merchant ships, they gain resources, which can be used to increase shield, hull, disruptor, or torpedo strength, purchase more beacons or torpedos, or repair vehicle damage. Combat takes place from a 1st person point of view, where the player must line up enemy vessels in the center of their crosshairs to fire upon the enemy. When the player's ship is destroyed, it's game over. The player receives a score and a rank at the end of their adventure based upon the number of enemy ships destroyed, ranging from ground pounder to starlord.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Horiron Simulations","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197972,"FileName":"1687038e-bf2e-44b1-807b-625ad3e7bcd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197972,"FileName":"c8ba13d0-b9c3-467d-ae58-5d5b548e39ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177542,"Name":"Shadow World","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Jantor is the name of the harsh and desolate planet that lies half in this dimension, and half in another. The strangeness of this shadow world is a result of the presence of large quantities of tricasmium; a rare ore with subtle and unusual properties. A Rigillian fleet has been sent to conquer Jantor, and only your Space Hornet interceptor can stop it.\n\nShadow World is a mostly side-scrolling shooter, ala Defender. Rigillian crystal ships slowly descend from the sky, and can only be defeated by having their central core destroyed using your interceptor's plasmatronic cannons. These crystal ships deploy a skimmer, which retrieves tricasmium from the surface, allowing the ships to descend safely. They also deploy guardian drones which act as escorts. Once a crystal ship reaches the surface of the planet, it becomes a colonizer and impervious to weapon fire. The colonizers can only be inactivated by picking up a tricasmium nugget and then flying over the entrance of the colonizer.\n\nYour interceptor is armed with a small number of smart bombs, which obliterates enemies on the screen and returns you to your base. Successful destruction of each waves of ships rewards you with another smart bomb. Armed with cannons and these bombs, you must prevent five active crystal ships from landing, or the entire planet will be sucked into a temporal vortex.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/140_NjyuUew","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Synapse Software Corporation","Publisher":"Synapse Software Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":177542,"FileName":"e98b98d4-3db3-45c9-979d-31a96bf03a80.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":177542,"FileName":"69bd4dab-1655-4eb5-b3e2-6b94f50fa6a8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":177542,"FileName":"b9476265-485b-469e-afa0-25fe3f7164e8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177542,"FileName":"ed537ed2-c03a-49a5-b91a-d42baf1d2ce7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":177542,"FileName":"d1f8df32-fb1f-4392-8f27-b30af3cf70e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":122133,"Name":"Shamus","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Infiltrate the lair of the elusive Shadow, shoot and sneak your way through his army of robotic minions, and hunt him down before he does the same to you.

Instead of a Colt 45 Peacemaker, your weapon is the FSS Demona, perhaps the best starship in the depleted Federation fleet.\n\nThe Demona has shields, hyperspace drive, and deadly lasers which can blast a barbarian raider out of existence with a single shot. Their hits, by contrast, will just scratch her shields, which you can easily reinforce with more energy. Energy is the catch, though. Every shot and hyperspace jump consumes an appreciable amount, while life support drains the ship as steadily as a clock ticks. More than their lasers, the barbarians' maneuverability is their deadliest weapon. Get a little too eager with your rapid-fire lasers and you'll have nothing left for that pesky life support system. Take too long to destroy all the enemies in your patrol zone, and they'll slip through to lay waste to the Federation's most populous planets.\n\nA single supply ship exists, which you can visit as often as you need. Just make sure you don't run out of gas getting there or lining up with its fuel pod. Hyperspace jumps also take a certain deftness. While dogfights within a sector range across unlimited three-dimensional space, hyperspace is flat and there'll be no jumping with the Demona's nose pointing off the galactic plane. Heading and azimuth are on the main screen, which is dominated by a view of the starry void, complete with crosshairs. When you do jump successfully, those stars disappear, then slowly expand from a thin, horizontal line as you enter the new sector. Energy, shields, and sensor readings are packed into the main screen, too. Separately, a map is available showing enemy presence in the sectors you have scanned, along with the location of that vital supply ship.\n\nDogfights rest on interpreting the trajectory of the barbarian raiders in order to draw them into your crosshairs and meet them there with a slightly anticipatory laser blast. Fifteen levels of difficulty are available; at higher levels an occasional second raider in the sector can make their shots a genuine hazard. Nonetheless, the primary challenge of higher difficulty is life support's rate of energy consumption. With the energy level ticking down faster, each dogfight becomes a race to target the enemy raider and return to the supply ship while there's still air in your lungs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172849,"FileName":"7b5c550c-3cd4-4d02-9dc0-aa375bf22db6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172849,"FileName":"2cafb65d-8882-4ff5-85d0-8913fc388385.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172849,"FileName":"e04aa337-796a-406e-a364-01d930f9db4c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172849,"FileName":"8d84f6bf-0b40-449c-955f-ba62e01241bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172849,"FileName":"bc4f8f0d-60bd-41ed-97f4-63d81cfcbd82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172849,"FileName":"d543a340-83b1-4db0-98ef-ba1f46eabe5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199755,"Name":"Show Down","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Christian Griesbeck","Publisher":"Christian Griesbeck","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199325,"Name":"Shuffleboard","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Aim Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196071,"Name":"Sidewinder","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Sidewinder is a side-scrolling shooter.

You have the choice of six American states to fly over (instead of three in the original) which are Kansas, Washington, Colorado, Michigan, Massachusetts or Texas, each having their own weather and terrain. The games viewpoint is a 3rd person perspective behind the plane again with the joystick and keyboard to control your plane. The game also included speech to help you in flying by giving instructions as you fly.\n\nIn Mail Run you have been given the task of delivering the mail from your home runway to either one other airport or various airports. There are four difficulty levels (Student, Private, Senior or Command). Before your flight you must re-fuel your plane taking note of the weight of the plane and you can decide how many airports you wish to fly to.\n\nIn practise flying you have 4 levels of difficulty (Clear, Landing, Contest or IFR). Clear allows you to fly in good weather, Landing is practising landing, Contest gives you a score for your landings and IFR is flying in low level clouds with zero visibility so you can only rely on your instrument panel.

However, it can hinder your reconnaissance as much as your enemies', and sometimes you'll find yourself under fire from an unseen source. Sound matters, too: your powergun is nearly silent, but the blaster alerts enemies as effectively as it destroys them.\n\nPlay is turn-based, but fast. The opportunity to press the right key flits by quickly, bringing new bursts of enemy gunfire around you. Varying movement options, weapons, and enemies make tactics the determining factor in your success. Two scenarios fit into the story: a diversionary expedition to blast everything in sight (except the civvies, so check your targets!), and a search-and-destroy mission to start the revolution.

The grid utilized the suns energy to create special energy crystals that allowed travel through space at the speed of light. It was not long before a total of sixteen energy grids were in orbit around the suns of the star systems throughout the galaxy. Unfortunately, now at the dawn of the 22nd century, due to build up of unstable disruptive energy pulses, it has become impossible for normal supply craft to collect the energy crystals from any of the orbital grids. To recover as many crystals from the grids as possible, a supply craft has been totally redesigned, giving it awesome speed and extraordinary fire-power. This craft is called the Sun Star. You have been chosen to fly it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Glenn G.

Primary sections of the game take part in the streets and sewers of Metropolis, where the opponents can use adjustable deflectors to guide the humans in the directions of their choice, as well as use their superpowers to manipulate the humans.The city is divided into several sectors and once a character collects a set numbers of diamonds the sector can be completed. In between sectors there is a combat zone which takes the form of various arcade-like mini games. If the character who decided to move between sectors wins the combat, play progresses to the next sector. Otherwise play returns to the previous sector.\n\nSuperman uses his heat vision and Darkseid the omega ray to battle, each hit will take energy away from the opponent.

But what can he do if his state of suspended animation prevents him from moving?\n\nSuspended is a text adventure game with a twist: instead of navigating the protagonist, the player indirectly controls six robots that do his bidding, exploring the environment and interacting with it. Each robot has different functions and has its own way of seeing reality and reacting to events around it. Iris is the only robot that can see and therefore visually describe locations and objects; Whiz can provide technical information obtained from computers; the sonar-powered Waldo is good at holding items; Auda is an expert in sounds; the cryptically speaking Poet senses the flow of electric currents; finally, Sensa can detect magnetic and photon emissions.

For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.\n\nThe game keeps a score and a high score, and you have a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there is no save feature. In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending. The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZRqQE76Nc0","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure; Platform","Developer":"Scott Spanburg","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"c936f25b-532e-469e-8dfa-9877158624fa.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"7e659733-b2dd-4c88-a02d-72150ca3262b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"80d58fd7-479f-4e12-ab7e-6de3aad0c673.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"6ef7fb72-0f1a-4f58-af37-f3d5b43e3790.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"ef9e621a-1e5a-4014-835e-afbce5e580f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"9922db3e-1317-432e-9959-1cfeb7151b41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"5bc0504f-a225-4931-95b3-05eb9f2c76e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"01903ef4-db17-457b-925f-46544ba0e3d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"134b824f-49c3-4e7e-9eb7-bfaf10b0bee1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"974f3e51-6ccb-48b9-a180-a98fdc2cefe3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"ad197305-205f-46a7-813d-9feb9376d00c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":162789,"FileName":"1ed0928c-63f0-4936-8243-2bbdd814d151.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158024,"Name":"The Great American Cross-Country Road Race ","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"The game puts the player in the position of a driver of a high-performance car, racing across the United States while passing through its major cities.

Your task is now (as commended by a digitised voice at the beginning of each level) simply to get back to the base in as short time as possible.\n\nThe Last V8 is an over-head driving game where you must drive through narrow roads without crashing into anything, and with a strict deadline for your arrival at the base. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of screen space to see where you're driving; two thirds of the screen is dedicated to instruments (speed readout, radiation level and mission objectives). The steering method is not the usual Sprint one; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.\n\nAll versions except the C128 version have two levels. The first one takes place in an almost pastoral landscape where you must reach the scientific base, after which you must find your way back to your own base while avoiding radiation sources.

In the age of steam-powered trains, there are opportunities to make money on great railroads. It will be up to the player to take control of a train on a railroad and turn a profit. The player does this by moving the train to a loading station that will supply raw material, and stopping in front of it with the appropriate car and blowing the whistle to begin the loading process. This is then delivered to the stations of industries that need them, unloading taking place the exact same way. The faster goods are delivered, the more money is made, with extra profits available when an industry is in critical need of a supply. Meters of available industry supplies can be shown on the screen. The train itself can only be stopped and move forwards and backwards, following the path of the train track, left and right movement is used only at switches, where the track splits into two directions. Each action of train movement uses coal, multiplied by the weight of the goods being carried. Coal is resupplied at the coal yard, and is loaded into the coal car the same way as other goods, spending money in order to buy coal. If the player runs out of coal while driving the train, it will cost them twice as much to have the coal delivered to the train. Every 3 minutes, $200 is deducted from the player for payroll and any crashed train costs another $200 in penalties. Each level is a unique track design, and can take place across cities, deserts, mountains and plains. As industry supplies are managed, a track is gradually built at the edge of the screen which will lead to the next level.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/VCwflYc6THc","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Interactive Picture Systems","Publisher":"Spinnaker Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"5525d8cd-9aeb-418d-802a-c6d0853f8d36.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"bf990190-fe70-429f-beac-0d8b0bc57af5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"7fe71050-8e29-4c80-918a-6e44563062d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"0f780451-3455-4430-900c-8b165080df1b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"1a4b06bd-626f-4b44-b93a-bdecb49b9953.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"5fb4a4f0-bfb2-4dd5-b309-0c62a5650c3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"04973469-53e0-4266-9c65-06a2607480a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196589,"FileName":"b7169ef7-e8e8-490a-ba45-2051f69b5f34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":195486,"Name":"Transmuter","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"In Transmuter humanity had to leave earth's surface and retract into the underground because the sun transformed into a red giant.

Desperate, the King Gaelyn sent a request for help to the lords of the castles in his land. From each castle, three subjects - a prince, a knight and a page were selected to face riddles and dragons.\n\nThis is the background of the board game Trivia Quest. After selecting the difficulty and their castle, each of the participating players (one to four, there are no computer players) needs to choose the correct answer out of four options in the first so-called \"wisdom round\". This is necessary to accumulate enough gold and food to enter the game map with a character and be able to progress there. An incorrect answer starts the next player's turn.\n\nOn the board itself, movement is also dependent on answering the questions which are prompted by landing on one of the trivia question squares. These are divided into four categories (for example,a TV square means a question out of television, literature or movies), and the faster a question has been answered correctly, the more squares a player's character can move. It's possible to switch between the three different characters provided enough gold has been accumulated. There are also special squares denoting dragon lairs. These trigger an arcade sequence where additional gold can be gained if the dragon is defeated, but in case of a loss the dragon also takes gold from the player. The fighting ability is influenced by the character type, with the page being the weakest. Finally, there are squares and situations which can lead to a \"wisdom duel\", meaning a player vs. player question battle.The quest ends when all three characters have reached a home castle, the winner being the player with the most gold.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Royal Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199359,"Name":"Trivia Trek","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Trivia Trek is a trivia game for one or two players.

Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.\n\nTwo game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment.

Guarding the treasure are monsters such as cretins, buzzards, skulls and spiders. The mazes are difficult to navigate and fraught with danger. One wrong move could send you plummeting to your death.\n\nTrolls and Tribulations is a side scrolling platform game with some puzzle like mechanics due to it's unusual control scheme and movement. Most mazes begin with a barrage of cretins that must be dispatched in order to open the door to the main portion of the maze. Your character has a gun that is capable of turning the cretins into eggs. After shooting them, you must quickly shove the eggs into the sewer water as they will hatch back into cretins after a short time. Your gun has limited ammo but which can be replenished in the middle of the screen.\n\nOnce the cretins have been defeated, the doors to the main portion of the maze are accessible. Here is where you will find treasures to increase your point total. The mazes require careful navigation as some treasures are placed in dangerous locations. Keys need to be recovered to open further doors allowing you to proceed to the maze's exit. Other monsters are present in this part of the maze and cannot be destroyed by your weapon. Instead it will take careful timing and jumps to avoid being killed by them.\n\nThe game is divided into three levels which can be chosen at the start. Each level has multiple mazes to work your way through.\n\nJoystick control is a little bit unusual. Aside from the normal left and right movement, pushing down shoots your weapon, pushing the button causes you to jump in the direction you are facing while pushing up does a vertical jump. When you move you will always move one complete step. This means you have to be careful when moving on small platforms as an extra tap on the joystick could send you off the edge. The structured movement gives the later parts of the maze a more puzzle-like feel than a straight action game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/IQXcG3gMnE8","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Designer Software","Publisher":"Creative Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122141,"FileName":"8ac24a8d-ef3b-406a-84ed-042345b81824.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122141,"FileName":"5e2bf487-abb0-43c6-835d-2bd4534c6e6e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122141,"FileName":"cfe1926f-3790-4310-8d9a-91be48c78dcc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122141,"FileName":"dd8e9a19-2dc1-4d3a-a713-49ef33169652.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122141,"FileName":"c576c734-56e1-45a0-9b67-a06694c92b19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122141,"FileName":"75e8253c-47a7-48f5-9649-f11b28a5df2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":198778,"Name":"Trull","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Trull is an action-arcade game, resembling the two popular games Snake and Pac-Man.\n\nYou play as the snake Trull, who is in a maze full of food.

A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you. Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by. Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day! As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side. Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long. If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.\n\nThe enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way. When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level.

The enemies cannot be destroyed but it is possible to hide from them in craters. After leaving the asteroid there is a second shoot 'em up screen.

Other than that the gameplay is pretty much the same as in Ultima I, with your single character roaming the land fighting monsters and looking for key items.\n\nIn the original Ultima a hero from a certain third rate blue planet orbiting an insignificant yellow sun came to the world of Sosaria and slew the evil wizard Mondain before he could fulfill his dreams of universal domination. Thus peace was brought to Sosaria, and the hero hailed as a champion of the people of all time.\n\nUnfortunately, Mondain happened to have a young apprentice/lover named Minax who is understandably upset over his death. Using her considerable powers, Minax travels through time and space to the hero's homeworld of Earth and instigates a nuclear war, thus serving the dual purpose of working out her frustration as well as erasing the hero from history.

Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him. The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues.

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar.\n\nThe fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them.\n\nInstead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first \"true\" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.\n\nCharacter creation is done by choosing responses to morally ambiguous questions. Each of the Eight Virtues corresponds to a character class; by determining the player's personal priorities in the virtues, the game assigns a class and a starting location for the Avatar. After emerging in Britannia, the player is free to explore it in various ways (on foot, moongate teleportation, on horseback, by ship, etc.). Certain items must be collected in any order to enter the Stygian Abyss and complete the game. The Avatar also has to reach the highest level in all virtues. This is achieved by various means: donating blood increases Sacrifice, not fleeing from combat increases Valor, etc. The process, however, is not irreversible: should the Avatar overpay a blind seller, he gains Compassion points; should he, on the other hand, cheat the seller by underpaying, his level in several virtues would decrease.\n\nThese unorthodox features of the game co-exist with plenty of traditional RPG elements, such as dungeons to explore and hostile monsters to kill. Enemies are encountered on the world map as well as in dungeons; combat takes place on separate top-down screens, allowing player-controlled and enemy parties freely move on them. Characters accumulate experience points and level up, gaining higher amount of hit points and access to stronger magic spells. Like in the previous installments of the series, world map, town exploration and combat are presented from a top-down view, while the dungeons are pseudo-3D and are explored from first-person perspective.\n\nUltima IV also introduces several new gameplay features to the series and role-playing games in general. A number of initially non-playable characters living in various areas of the game world are able to to join the party and fight alongside the hero, replacing traditional player-generated characters or mercenaries and adventurers available only in special locations. Additional new elements include buying and combining reagents in order to cast spells, puzzle rooms in dungeons, and others.\n\nThe FM Towns version, while identical to the others in gameplay, introduces upgraded graphics similar to those used in next installment of the series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/_mw3K6BPHRg?t=209","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"David Lubar","Publisher":"Origin Systems","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195111,"FileName":"cbecbeb5-fec2-4b80-b551-09b398ab22fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195111,"FileName":"247f278d-7a22-43af-9b30-2b14984aadcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195111,"FileName":"a0cf93f9-4fa0-434b-b543-b8fe37be7dfd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195111,"FileName":"a62003c7-2cf9-435d-939f-fff02180444d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195111,"FileName":"15a26aee-4ce8-438d-8619-74986ab49d81.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194403,"Name":"Ulysses and the Golden Fleece","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Ulysses and the Golden Fleece is an adventure game where you play the part of Ulysses in ancient Greece.

Shall we play a game?\n\nThis strategic game is based on the popular 1983 movie of the same name, starring Matthew Broderick. It might remind people of Missile Command but the action is slower and spread over six screens which represent different areas of the U.S.A. Enemy missiles, planes, and subs will attack and you must direct your own forces, which include missiles, planes, subs, and satellites, to intercept them. Each type of defense has strengths and weaknesses (missiles are fast but limited in range, planes are slower but have unlimited range). Satellites are a better all-around defense but are only available every so often. Some weapons aren't available in certain areas, and some enemies are resistant to certain weapons, so you must alter your strategy accordingly.\n\nAs your bases and cities are struck, a DefCon indicator for each area will count down and when the overall DefCon reaches 1 for a minute or when all cities and bases are destroyed, a counterstrike is launched and the game is over. The game is won by preventing a counterstrike long enough for a cease-fire to be reached. There's eight different difficulty levels to progress through as you get the hang of it. A two-player mode on the Colecovision lets one player to use the Roller Controller to guide and fire weapons, while the second player inputs keypad commands.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iH7He8g52I","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Coleco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195193,"FileName":"8f2120b0-a0e7-46fb-9c93-336779f32e4a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195193,"FileName":"9c20a1e7-095b-442b-ae10-6cf7d99041a1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195193,"FileName":"dc00b5c7-7898-4dc9-8f6b-3ed2e1882bb7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195193,"FileName":"50fa15d7-9d1c-4a95-9fe9-36d08866c829.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":177544,"Name":"Warhawk","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Warhawk is a vertical-scrolling shooter set in space (its authors were inspired by coin-op arcade game Star Force).

Around this time, the game engine was redone to allow complete sentences instead of the more primitive 2-word Scott Adams parser that had been used previously although early versions of the game may have still used the cruder parser.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Digital Fantasia","Publisher":"Channel 8 Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136079,"Name":"Wayout","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Wayout is an early use of first-person 3D perspective, featuring a small gameplay window but smooth 360-degree movement.

The object of the game is to fill in the missing letters of an incomplete word. On each round a word will appear at the top of the screen with several letters missing.

The player needs to select the letters that are missing from the word before time runs out and the word reaches the bottom of the screen. Successfully completing a word earns points, but if the word reaches the bottom of the screen then the player loses a life. The game ends when all five lives are lost. There are several skill levels available which affect the time limit for each word and the complexity of the word. The game includes over 700 words of varying length and difficulty. Scoring in the game is based on how many correct/incorrect letters are selected and whether or not hints are utilized.\n\nIn addition to the alphabet at the bottom of the screen are several asterisks; these represent hints. If more than one missing letter remains the player can choose a hint to fill in a missing letter in exchange for less points when the word is solved.\n\nOn more difficult skill levels, a demon word will occasionally appear; demon words are more difficult and move very fast compared to the other words. If the player fails when a demon word appears a life is not lost, however hints are not available. Also, if a demon word is not solved then the solution will not be revealed to the player unlike normal words. On skill level 7 (the toughest) there are also challenge rounds which consist entirely of demon words; in this case failing a demon word does cost a life.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":null,"Publisher":"CBS Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197979,"Name":"What's Different","ReleaseYear":"1979","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"PDI","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":174054,"Name":"Whirlinurd","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Nurds are always hungry and Naples Yerty, Hooseby Nurd, Hamish Pupkin and Melvin Lugby are no exception and require feeding so they must explore 50 levels to find four pieces of food on each level.

Out of concern for your brother's future and intrigued by his repeated mumbling about priceless ancient artifacts, you decide to retrace his steps.\n\nYou earn points in the game a number of different ways: retrieving artifacts and tools, protecting yourself or your brother, and completing levels.

Different weapons demonstrate unique characteristics; for example, spears can attack two squares away, flails ignore the enemy's shields, and axes have a chance of breaking them completely. Shields are used to defend against frontal attacks and those coming from whatever side the shield is equipped on. The player can opt to skip these details and have the battle proceed automatically.\n\nExperience gained by characters is spent on skills, attributes and life points. Unlike in most comparable games, classes and their unique abilities are not assigned to the characters, but must instead be \"bought\" by using intelligence points. The classes are Thief, Ranger, Fighter, Priest and Sorcerer; any of those can be combined with another one for a single character.\n\nWeapons can be imbued with various enhancements. Magical weapons inflict elemental damage (called \"injuries\" in the game); \"Plus\" weapons cause extra bleeding, which may affect the character's health, making him faint; \"Life Blast\" weapons can kill a character in such a way that he cannot be resurrected afterwards.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/THlEdbzcW8c","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","Publisher":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":196597,"FileName":"2685dc40-4e52-4b40-8729-97ba310b5edd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196597,"FileName":"3bdc5425-bacf-41f2-8e2f-f1dc4bdc1e09.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196597,"FileName":"887b26c7-f6a8-406d-95a6-4a08885b159f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":196597,"FileName":"38364723-7690-4813-9806-2784dcfb342e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196597,"FileName":"824b612c-23fb-4018-a852-fd42f8c1e5fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":196597,"FileName":"5cb08de8-c71e-4a26-b277-934cabf0bada.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197189,"Name":"Wizard's Gold","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Atari Program Exchange","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197404,"Name":"Wladca","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":"Władca is a turn based strategy game, similar to Defender of the Crown.

In the Atari version, the player has a large smoothly scrolling map, while the Apple II version breaks the map into 16 individual segments, which can be viewed separately. Character movement and commands are placed via text, and each player takes turns inputting 5 commands for their forces, followed by their opponent. Players control air, naval, infantry, and armored forces, and forces must be carefully supplied and managed. Commands are affected by troop morale, supplies, and terrain conditions.\n\nThe second segment involves political maneuvering. The player is in control of military movements, but also taxes and oil supplies. The player must protect oil supplies, and attempt to gain enemy land. The allocated resources are then used to purchase newer and more advances weapons and supplies from one of 24 foreign nations. Only allied nations will trade with players, and players can win over allies by supporting their diplomatic efforts, trade, and careful use of nuclear weaponry. More importantly, neutral nations must be won over to the player's cause for the final conflict.\n\nInevitably, this regional conflict will explode into global nuclear war between nations, based upon their allied status.

The player can use nuclear and non-nuclear arms, and nuclear fallout is fatal to forces.

(IQ in Europe) is based on the classic pen and paper game Dots and Boxes, but instead of drawing four lines connecting dots to make a box, you have to draw six lines (a trail) to connect dots placed at a diagonal angle to complete a territory. To draw a trail, you control a worm-like creature called a SAIL (Super Artificially Intelligent Lifeforms) and you and up to three other computer controlled SAIL's move about the single screen drawing trails to connect the grid of dots. There are three modes of control over your SAIL and these are New, Auto and Wild. New allows you manual control over your SAIL and once it detects a pattern of movement will take over and repeat the pattern. Auto allows the computer to control your SAIL and to make intelligent moves and finally Wild lets the computer move the SAIL in random directions. As a SAIL moves it leaves behind a coloured trail and if a SAIL of a different colour touches the trail then it changes to that colour. Once a dot has six trails connecting to other dots then the trail stays that colour for the duration of the game and becomes a territory with a point given to that player. A SAIL cannot cross a trail turned into a territory or move to a dot occupied by another SAIL so if a SAIL is unable to move then it is removed from the screen and game over. Once all SAIL's have ended their game then the amount of points are added up and the winner is the SAIL with the most.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197658,"Name":"Wyprawy Kupca","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":"Wyprawy Kupca is a turn-based trade game.

In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack. Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.\n\nThis is a homebrew port from the Atari 5200 system as Xevious was never released on the Atari 8-bit platform.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-71-Is9G2wk","Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Jim Huether","Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185600,"FileName":"ba947c67-b2f6-4484-916e-0a541da56500.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185600,"FileName":"667d3d61-bc5e-4725-b0c5-49432edd3ac6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185600,"FileName":"137b1ccd-797c-4632-8c35-ab53eb2234b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199098,"Name":"Xtal: Adventure in Space","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Antic Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":199098,"AlternateName":"Xtal","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":199488,"Name":"Yaacov Agam's Interactive Painting","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Was to be released by Atari's French division as La Gamme d'Agam.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Atari, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167581,"Name":"Yogi Bear & Friends in the Greed Monster: A Treasure Hunt","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"All the toys in the World have been stolen by the Greed Monster, so Top Cat has sent Yogi's Treasure Hunters to find them all.

Capable of destroying entire planets, the fortress has all but wiped out the Draconian Star Force and extorts a vast wealth of transuranic ore from the enslaved system. Recently, though, a ray of hope has been glimpsed: a fissure in the asteroid was detected by long-range neutrino scans. It could lead to the core of the fortress, to the emerald power crystal, to freedom for Chi Draconis!\n\nFive brave pilots in tiny fighters are lined up to attempt navigation of the fissure and destruction of the power emerald. First they must face the patrolling Vorrakian squadron, then the mine field, and on through unknown dangers and defenses. One at a time you will guide them; if the first fails, then the second will start the approach. The one who succeeds, in the fine Sisyphean tradition of 1980's video games, gets to start all over again.\n\nThe game screen offers a cross-sectional view through the asteroid. If your fighter impacts the cavern wall, a mine, or any of the myriad hazards populating the fissure, the end is instantaneous; there is no flash of light, no debris, just oblivion. Suddenly you are back on approach toward the asteroid, guiding the next brave pilot, or on the score screen looking at your rating, which begins with \"Ground Gripper.\" Forward movement is relentless. Thrusters will speed up the ship temporarily, but there is no stopping and surveying for the best route. Though the ships are each equipped with a laser, its range is hardly greater than the length of the ship. All your offense is point-blank, all your defense lies in dodging.\n\nTwo caves of increasing difficulty await those who conquer the first level, and the adept who surpasses all three meets the first cave again, but with sluggish controls. That's if you have the easy data access of the game's disk version. The cassette version can only work with what is loaded in memory, so defeating level one takes you back to level one.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Atari 800","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Crystalware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":158479,"Name":"Zaxxon","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"The object of the game is to shoot targets and not run out of fuel.

The player uses text entry to manipulate and move through the world. The parser was advanced for the time, and allows complex constructs such as \"drop all but lantern\".\n\nWhen the player enters the house, it yields a number of intriguing objects, including a brass, battery-powered lantern, an empty trophy case, and an Elvish sword of great antiquity. Beneath the rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar, which is revealed to be one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land known as the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters a colorful host of dangerous enemies, including deadly grues who only prey on their victims in the dark, an axe-wielding troll, a giant cyclops who flees in terror at the mention of Odysseus, a vampire bat that can drop the player anywhere in the mine if encountered, evil spirits guarding the Entrance to Hades, and a nimble-fingered thief armed with a stiletto who makes mapping the maze difficult by removing or scattering any items that the player might drop to leave a trail.\n\nThe ultimate goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two complex mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3.\n\nPlacing all of the treasures into the trophy case scores the player 350 points and grants the rank of \"Master Adventurer.\" An ancient map with further instructions then magically appears in the trophy case. These instructions provide access to a stone barrow. The entrance to the barrow is the end of Zork I and the beginning of Zork II.\n\nThere are 28 ways for the player to die.

The player's goal in the wizard's realm is to avoid his capricious tricks and to learn to control his magic.\n\nLike its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game.
