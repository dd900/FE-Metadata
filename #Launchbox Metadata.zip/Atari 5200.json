You and up to three friends can select from any of eight player sprites, male or female. There are six skill levels with eight buildings per level. After you finish a building, you will be given part of a special message. There are six messages, one per skill level.\n\nYou get from floor to floor by way of elevators. Be sure the elevator is at your floor when you board or you will fall down the elevator shaft. There are also three ladders out of the basement. Watch out for Flying Half-Pints. They will appear on one side of the building at any floor except the basement and will move horizontally across. You must jump or duck to avoid them.\n\nStarting at building number two, you must also avoid Dumb Buckets. These will walk around and ride the elevators but they always move in a set pattern. Starting on building three and continuing every other building, you have to contend with Brenda, the superintendent's brat. She will put hand prints on your freshly painted walls, which will cost you forty points and require repainting to finish that building. You can grab the candy cane in these buildings and give it to her. This will stop her for fifteen seconds so you can repaint.\n\nStarting with building four, you must beware of the Bucket Chucker. Unlike the Dumb Bucket, he does not follow a set pattern, he follows you. You cannot destroy the Bucket Chucker but there are two ways he can be trapped. One way is to use the paint mixer, a square within a square. You touch it to turn it on for four seconds and if the Bucket Chucker touches it while it is on, he will shake for four seconds. You can turn the paint mixer on over and over while the Bucket Chucker is in it, unlimited times. Another way to trap the Bucket Chucker is to go to the basement, lead the Bucket Chucker to the ladders, go up a ladder, avoiding the elevator, then go left or right. The Bucket Chucker will then be stuck in the basement until you lose a brush.\n\nStarting on building five, you must jump over steam pipes or they will trip you, losing you a brush.

There are two kinds of enemies in the game:\nPookas - A race of round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles.\nFygars - A race of green dragons who can breathe fire.\nThe player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels through destructible environments. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.\nA partially inflated monster will gradually deflate and recover after a few seconds, during which time the player can pass safely through it. The monsters normally crawl through the tunnels in the dirt but can turn into ghostly eyes and travel slowly through the dirt. The last enemy on a level will try to escape off the top left of the screen.\nMore points are awarded for popping an enemy further down in the dirt (the levels are color-coded). In addition, Fygars are worth double points if exploded horizontally, since they can only breathe fire horizontally in the direction they are facing. Extra points are also awarded for dropping rocks on enemies in order to eliminate them rather than inflating them. If one enemy is killed by the rock, it is worth 1000 points. The next two add 1500 points each, and any after that add 2000.

Your goal is to locate and retrieve the crown, then make it to the top of the mine alive! There are several steps that need to be completed before you can retrieve the crown. First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

Crushing more than one Sno-Bee at once will increase the number of points awarded. There are a total of sixteen levels, which repeat in order starting on the seventeenth round.\nAs the player crushes those on patrol, new Sno-Bees hatch from eggs located within ice blocks. At the start of each level, blocks that contain these eggs are briefly identified by flashing the color of that level's Sno-Bees. Eggs can be eliminated by crushing the ice blocks that contain them. If Pengo pushes a side wall the water \"vibrates\", any adjacent Sno-Bees will be briefly stunned, and are eliminated (for 100 points) if Pengo walks over them in this state. Eliminating all Sno-Bees in a round will progress the player to the next.\nDiamond blocks are unbreakable; when connected in a horizontal or vertical line the player earns bonus points: 10,000 points if aligned without being against a wall or if only one diamond block is touching a wall, 5,000 points if all three are against the wall. Alignment will also temporarily stun all Sno-Bees.\nAfter 60 seconds elapse in a round without a death, the game enters into sudden death mode; the music tempo and movement of the Sno-Bees accelerates. If a single Sno-Bee remains in the round, a jingle plays and the Sno-Bee accelerates in an attempt to reach a corner where it safely fades away.\nThe game will always start with the same maze on power up.

While the coin-op has a four-button arrangement for aiming lasers, this version uses the joystick, meaning the ship fires in the same direction it is moving as long as the fire button is pressed. This is inexcusable, as each 5200 controller is equipped with four fire buttons (not to mention a keypad). As with many 5200 titles, this one responds sluggishly to the non-centering joysticks, making for a less enjoyable experience. Fans of the original will notice a couple of other differences between versions. The 5200's ship slows down when it fires and can be set to single shots or rapid fire in the options screen.","Publisher":"Atari, Inc","ReleaseDate":"1984-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vanguard_(video_game)"},"5227":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Bally Midway","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ab670c34-ae48-41b9-9c05-4c39da06b60d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc4e3e4c-fa21-46e6-a862-326244684b70.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5895289b-16dc-4712-9392-595b7f143c4b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c506dc21-301f-4753-b002-30782d9f291b.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"00596a75-fb0d-46e1-a62b-77de720ad505.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4d64fcc1-d9ea-4bac-bb94-1da9eb573200.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wizard of Wor","Overview":"Wizard of Wor is an arcade shooter played from a top-down point of view.\n\nThe player controls a warrior who is trapped in a dungeon.

Castle Blast is Ronen Habot's first foray into programming the Atari 5200. Ronen used this experience as a means to write a tutorial on Atari 5200 programming to assist others who might want to write games for the system.\n\nCastle Blast made its debut at the 2002 Classic Gaming Expo, where it was sold with a box, manual and cart. AtariAge held a Castle Blast Label Contest in April, 2002. Castle Blast may be ordered directly from the author, Ronen Habot, by visiting the Castle Blast Development Page.\n\nThe object of this game is to destroy the Castle on the Mothership. You fire Vertical Trajectory Missiles, or VTMs, at the shield on the bottom of the Mothership. When you penetrate the shield, then blast the Castle. To score extra points, you can also shoot the enemy spaceships flying overhead.\n\nIf you destroy the Castle, you advance to the next level, where you will need to contend with Focused Energy Beams, or FEBs, fired from the Mothership. There will also be stars appearing in the sky, making it harder to target the spaceships.\n\nIf you manage to obliterate the Castle again, you will proceed to the next level, which adds ground-based tanks assaulting you. You have Horizontal Trajectory Missiles, or HTMs, to deal with this new enemy but do not lose sight of your primary goal.\n\nYour joystick moves you left or right. The lower button fires VTMs, the upper button fires HTMs.","Publisher":"Ronen Habot","ReleaseDate":"2002-08-10T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"22377":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Patrick Bass","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"9795f1f7-7e17-447a-850c-dc69baf93cbb.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d0445cf6-8117-4e0f-bb0c-dcaf2629c9fe.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ee179144-5b64-42de-9db8-9b08375b12b3.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4aaea50f-f1b3-4d7a-a3cc-323351a481db.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a708c4b-c79f-4cc1-896c-54bc778d7f2a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1beea166-0bed-4d3d-9f2e-94e23b17fd8d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"58c34455-da76-4db8-b67f-ff29def84e8c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"23580807-fe55-4aa9-abae-d59ebe51a4d0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"RealSports Basketball","Overview":"There are two significantly different versions of Realsports Basketball for the Atari 5200, both programmed by Patrick Bass.

These titles would have utilized the 5200 Kid’s Controller, which was actually just a giant keypad that would have easy for children with small hands to use.  However, while the 2600 children’s line was released (featuring completely different games), the 5200 games and controller never saw the light of day.  The games were however eventually released by CBS on the Atari 8-bit computers and the Nintendo Entertainment System, although some were slightly retooled.\n\nAs you may have guessed, Astro Grover is an educational game featuring that lovable blue demon Grover.  Although the title suggests a game about discovering the solar system, Astro Grover is really about counting and numbers.  Atari simply borrowed Grover’s astronaut persona from the reoccurring skits on Sesame Street to make it more interesting.   Astro Grover consists of five different mini-games offering up some amusing edutainment that would appropriate for 5-8 year olds.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1983-08-08T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NQDuHveP0lY"},"34470":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Viz Kidz","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"d33e2836-0e1c-4345-bbb1-c855b37039ad.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"77568018-92ff-4100-b633-c22b6af5881a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f6762c2b-fc5e-4b91-8a2e-12eb3322c84e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a5a18314-0701-43c0-83fc-dac471a23a60.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Blaster","Overview":"Blaster developed by Vid Kidz for Williams was released for the arcades and is quite obscure.

You are the captain of the ship Legacy. Your ultimate goal is to destroy the Warmongers' missile bases but you must also protect your cities.\n\nYou begin the game in command mode. You select your other modes with the joystick. Up for navigation, down for torpedo, left for sea-to-air and right for sea-to-land.\n\nNavigation\nIn navigation mode, you will see an overhead map of the world. You will note that there is a black dot in a black circle. This is you and the circle represents your effective range. You move the circle about the screen to target ships or known missile bases or to refuel at a city. You use fuel only when you are in navigation mode. When you are within range, or if an enemy ships comes within your range, press the space bar to return to the command mode then change to the desired mode.\n\nTorpedo\nIf you are within range of an enemy ship, switch to torpedo mode. In this mode, you will use the scanner at the bottom to line up your target. Move out of line to avoid a direct hit. Beware of war ship as they will chase you and have the most firepower. Hunter ships will also chase you. While their firepower is not as high as war ships, it is still fairly good. Intelligence ships have the weakest firepower and will not chase you. They can be found on the right side of the screen. If one is destroyed and there are any hidden missile bases, there is a eighty percent chance a hidden base will be revealed.\n\nSea-to-land\nIf you want to destroy a missile base or refuel, enter sea-to-land mode. To refuel, get near a city then enter this mode. When you are in sea-to-land mode, you will know you are within range if you see \"Dock for refueling\" on the screen. You then place the cross hairs on the base of the city and wait for refueling to complete, unless you or a city are under attack. Do not use the fire button to exit or you will fire on your city. To destroy a missile base, position your cross hairs using the scanner on the screen until you are on a missile launcher then fire. Be advised that when you fire on a missile base, they will shoot missiles at a city.\n\nSea-to-air\nIf a city is under attach, switch to this mode. You will control a weapons satellite. Use you joystick, or the trak-ball , if you plugged one into port 2, to aim at an incoming missile and press fire to blast it. If it gets past you but has not reached your city, you get a \"Refocusing\" message and the view switches to a short range view where you will get one more try.\n\nBe warned that ships can attack you no matter what mode you are in. On the easiest level, there are no hidden bases nor do you use fuel.\n\nThe Atari 5200 version of this game was never released but is however mostly identical to the Atari 8-Bit version that was released.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ncLHZgMoqgY"},"34472":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"675cf3c1-3e6b-46bd-bc35-0969f6c53da5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"540d753c-a210-41aa-b84a-4b81b5f3513b.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"69e3ab4d-92c1-441d-9e2d-c7c34d58af86.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"103edcd7-ba9e-462c-86a8-a7f5720db995.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9ab1828e-7d56-4dad-a264-f867c1a919ba.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Frisky Tom","Overview":"A prototype game that was never officially released for the Atari 5200, Frisky Tom is a port of the obscure Nichibutsu coin-op of the same name in which you play a plumber who must climb up and fix broken pipes to keep a steady stream of water flowing from the tank at the top of the screen to the reservoir at the bottom.  Unfortunately this house is infested with mice which roam the screen, gnawing through pipes and generally causing problems for our man Tom.\n\nOnce a mouse gnaws through a pipe, you'll see the flow of water stop and a pipe piece will fall to the ground.  To repair the pipe Tom must pick up the fallen piece (you can hold two pieces a time), and put it back into the hole.  To get to where the holes are, Tom must carefully climb up and navigate the maze of pipes.  Although Tom can cross short gaps in the pipes, he'll need to go around the larger ones.  While climbing around on the pipes, Tom will run across several different kinds of mice. Each mouse has its own color and purpose.\n\nWhen the flow of water is interrupted, the timer in the reservoir will begin to count downward from 5000 at the rate of 100 points per second.  The only way to stop this countdown is to restore the water flow by fixing the pipes.  If the timer reaches zero, Tom will lose a life and play the current level over again.  If Tom is able to get enough water into the reservoir (keeping the timer above 1500), he'll be rewarded with a bonus intermission showing a woman taking a shower.\n\n- Excerpt from www.atariprotos.com","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1983-07-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wswlpoL6wRc"},"34473":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"2c5aea32-690a-402f-8c82-c70497755af7.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"df3ec7bb-8dda-4560-915f-86fd720486b9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7277cd5b-f76e-4d8b-83c9-485377b251c9.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6df81c2d-c8ef-45e0-a26e-281371175e8c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"681ec5bc-607e-494f-8771-524dd021e807.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ce3dfa14-60cb-4764-8c2a-57a7956e3e50.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Jr. Pac-Man","Overview":"Jr.Pac-Man was never released for the Atari 5200, however a prototype does exist.

Thought to have been based on perhaps a port of the arcade game Locomotion before being re skinned with Roadrunner and Wiley E Coyote.\n\nAt the start of each level a birdseed truck will weave its way through the maze dropping off piles of birdseed as it goes.  The goal of Roadrunner is to move the tiles around so Wiley Coyote eats as much birdseed as he can before the Roadrunner gets it.  Each tile contains a portion of the road which Wiley and the Roadrunner walk on, by sliding the tiles around you can make paths leading to the piles of birdseed or to the tunnels on the side of the board.  The tunnels connect one side of the screen to the other, and can be useful for warping across the screen.  Unfortunately some of these tunnel entrances are really just painted on, so if Wiley attempts to enter one he'll knock himself out.  The only way to tell if a tunnel is real is to watch the Roadrunner and see which tunnels he takes.\n\nWiley can die if he either runs off the end of the tile or runs into a false tunnel.  The Roadrunner appears to be able to back up from dead end track pieces and tunnels so he is impossible to kill, but you can trap him on two dead end pieces and complete the level at your leisure.  Once all the birdseed is gone the game moves to the next level.  If you happen to run into the Roadrunner you will score 10 points, and you the Roadrunner will be transported back to your starting points.  Wiley also scores 35 points for each tile he crosses, and 50 points for each pile of birdseed he collects.\n\n- Excerpt from AtariProtos.com","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1983-06-03T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hBz7-YfqosA"},"34490":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e51e63be-09b0-4763-9613-14ab1d0f2bf8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3b56c6a0-338d-4f2a-a856-c22cd0f981f7.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"380abb92-d50d-4523-86b7-482776326942.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a90016ac-c53a-4dc1-99bf-f6cf5e5d01fe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1d608af0-5eea-4ee5-9da2-6717cc61cf19.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sport Goofy","Overview":"An unreleased prototype for the Atari 5200, based on the classic 80s Disney short cartoons of the same name . You take control of goofy as he competes in two events, the Marathon Dive and the Pogo Pop.\n\nThe Marathon Dive is a game in which you must guide Goofy up a series of platforms so he can reach the diving platform and jump off before the timer runs out.  As Goofy climbs up the platforms he must avoid little armored tanks, which will chase Goofy around.  Thankfully these tanks can't jump, reverse direction, or use the ladders, so they can be avoided by jumping over them or leading them into a hole (which will cause them to fall down to the next level).  Also hindering Goofy's progress are large gaps in the platforms which must be carefully jumped over.  If Goofy falls through a hole he'll fall down one level but is otherwise unharmed, however if he is hit by a tank he'll loose a life.\n \nIf Goofy makes it to the top of the platform he will run off the end, making it about halfway across the screen before realizing that he's running in mid-air.  Now Goofy will begin to fall, and you must guide him down to the little floating platform below.  However the floating platform is constantly moving in an erratic fashion, so hitting it can be tough.  If you successfully reach the platform, Goofy will smash into it and have his parachute open a second too late (in typical cartoon fashion).  If you miss the platform Goofy will fall into the water and drown (I guess he doesn't know how to swim).  As the levels progress the tanks will begin to move faster and faster, the diving platform has more holes in it, and the floating platform moves more erratically.  Eventually the difficulty will wrap around however, and the game will get very easy again.\n\nPogo Pop takes place on a series of squares where Goofy bounces up and down on a pogo stick in an effort to touch every tile.  This may sound easy but there's a catch, every time you jump one of the tiles disappears, so the tile that was below you may not be there when you land.  As the levels progress the frequency of the tiles disappearing increases, making it harder and harder not to fall through the floor.  \n \nWhile you're jumping on tiles you can attempt to pop the Mickey Mouse balloons floating above you for extra points.  The balloons come in several different colors and are worth a varying amount of points.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1983-06-15T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=khYbKE34oqU"},"34491":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"42be635a-cd7a-48ea-b862-86c2954429e1.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a0b47f65-1d8d-4caf-9d6c-6d3488fbc5aa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"52fa0ca2-1135-4e1e-b136-462da2582270.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"59482d71-1628-4d2c-9edd-29bf9987a0c0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e30baa6e-748b-470e-8ad2-545c1494d0ce.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dd5d81c8-ceee-43cb-98a8-189101c1d1bc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Stargate","Overview":"An unreleased prototype port of the popular Williams game Stargate.\n\nThe sequel to Defender and much like the arcade game you fly around blasting aliens and trying to survive long enough to save humanoids.

Hold jump button to set angle (42 degrees is optimal).\n\nJavelin throw – Running by alternating button presses and then using action button correct timing for angle (43 degrees is optimal).\n\n110 Meter Hurdles – Running by alternating button presses and using action button to time hurdles\n\nHammer throw – Spinning initiated by pressing a run button once and then correctly timed press of action button to choose angle (45 is optimal).\n\nHigh jump – Running (speed set by computer) and then action button must be held down to determine angle of jump. Once in the air, the run button can be rapidly pressed for additional height.\n\nGameplay screenshot of the long jump event.\n\nIn each event, there is a qualifying time or level that the player must achieve to advance to the next event; failing to qualify (in one heat for running events or three tries in the other events) will reduce the player's number of lives by one, but if none are present in his\/her disposal, the game will end.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1984-05-10T00:00:00-07:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4BfPGbV5a-0 Apr"},"34494":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"df1fad9d-7d8f-497a-b63f-9a03d04654a5.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fe79e7d9-90f9-4c30-bdec-bf79e83b96f9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d85504b4-b2d4-423b-9263-4dbf9c626efa.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0ff5a915-15a2-47eb-a417-42702ac00239.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1ff47c32-218e-4e07-a544-2baa0bed525f.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61c50f4f-623d-4afa-9d4f-c497775f56a1.PNG","Region":"United States","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dc3d5aeb-ecf3-4aaf-9ca7-2cce19865f0c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0fbd5584-b14d-4daa-a83a-079dc2cfa483.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Xari Arena","Overview":"Never officially released for the Atari 5200 platform. However, a more complete prototype version with track ball support was discovered and released by AtariAge.\n\nYour goal is to destroy all the Xari's that come out of the well in the center of the screen before they can destroy all your blocks. You can use the joystick or the trackball controller.\n \nEach player resembles a hollow paddle (like a capsule), which you can move around your side of the screen.  Your paddle can catch and hold up to three fireballs (the little star looking things that the Xari's shoot), and each stored fireball allows you to destroy one Xari by running into it.  If you hit a Xari without any fireballs stored in your paddle, it is temporarily stunned and you cannot catch or deflect any shots for a few seconds.  If you already have three fireballs stored up, your paddle will start reflecting the fireballs back at the Xari's (a great tactic for those hard to reach guys that won't come near you) and at your partner (which is not so good).  You can choose to reflect shots even if you don't have three fireballs stored up by pressing the bottom controller button.\n \nIf things start to get out of control you can activate your fire extinguisher (using the top controller button) to temporarily protect your blocks.  The fire extinguisher coats your blocks with foam and will destroy any shots that touch it.  the foam moves quickly down your blocks and only lasts for a few seconds so you have to use it wisely (like when fireballs get behind your blocks).  You get one new fire extinguisher each level, which can be stored for later use.","Publisher":"AtariAge","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=88d4-1dOMW0"},"34495":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"66dc9932-453b-467c-9010-fc4d815e911c.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"046370c4-6595-4a71-8200-fbcbc0c4e9e3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7755364a-caf3-4ce5-bfe5-4cc553d42a84.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6502746f-bee0-411d-897a-751a60403dbc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7a82c092-75dd-409f-836a-13bf92d131cc.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"acea9710-9842-4fcc-9c84-9c50520276ff.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Xevious","Overview":"An unreleased prototype based on the popular Namco shooting game.\n\nIt's a nightmare, but it's true.  Scientific research has determined that we are the actual aliens on Earth and the evil Xevions are the original inhabitants.  Now the Xevions want Earth back. minus the humans! Earth's last hope is an experimental fighter plane known as the Solvalou.  The mission is dangerous, success isn't guaranteed, and odds are this is a one-way trip.  But at this point it's do or die!\n\nAs Earth's last hope, you must successfully defeat the Xevion assault fleet before they reclaim earth.  However this won't be an easy task, the Xevions have had over a millennia to develop the biggest, nastiest, and most destructive ships Earth has ever seen.  Thankfully the Solvalou is armed with the latest in weapons technology which will cut through the Xevion hordes like a hot knife through butter.  The Solvalou has two main weapons, a laser blaster for taking out air targets, and a photon bomber for destroying ground targets.  Over the course of the game you'll run into numerous enemy types which can only be destroyed using the appropriate weapon, so mastering the dual shot (air and ground) technique is vital.","Publisher":"Atari","ReleaseDate":"1984-01-04T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Unreleased","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u9Iy6C28c88"},"34680":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mean Hamster","Genres":"Adventure; Horror","Images":[{"FileName":"04d6d124-db69-4ae0-8a08-c795c8320566.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"edb866e0-3d78-4bfc-b274-44d898abb4b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Haunted House II 3D","Overview":"A homebrew \"sequel\" to Haunted House originally for the Atari 5200 by Mean Hamster.\n\nYou enter a mansion with thirty or sixty rooms, depending of your selection.
