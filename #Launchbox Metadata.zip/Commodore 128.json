The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.\n\nElite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years). \n\nA 128 only, updated version released in 1998 added features such as an autopilot (as an alternative to the docking computer), the ability to sell ship equipment, an Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system and special cargo contracts.","Publisher":"Telecomsoft (U.S.)","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K9xMuskMERw","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elite_(video_game)"},"170880":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Heribert Arenz","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"88d32019-e011-4daa-9855-2b19828b78fd.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9358f7d2-ac98-4fb9-8306-3e88ea64af61.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e8b561f-9e10-4361-b510-c699ff286750.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"272d4bb8-794c-4acf-ba0a-9a6fc90e66a3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mythos 1","Publisher":"Ariolasoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"171420":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Last V8 128"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"David Darling","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"7fd4d9d8-0a39-4abf-9271-e3d1e25c84a9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7ce4d795-00b4-4c85-bd85-a3569027c839.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d95abbdc-bd1f-4d16-a058-d18ed7da8a09.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"59a36b15-819a-466b-8cff-7f699010b7f8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"de332540-4727-4eb8-beba-ae4cadef1d9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"833010ae-8b52-47f6-aa80-3a7ecc75b7df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Last V8","Overview":"The Commodore 128 version of The Last V8 takes place in the same post-apocalyptic landscape as the more basic original.

The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins. Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.\nThis game was released as a separate version for C128 but apart from animated spectators not present and a bit more speed in some areas over the C64 version, it didn't offer anything new.","Publisher":"Anco Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XZ5F8CxkLHE"},"171759":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Marc Blank","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"20f41f28-8c7d-4fa6-9c6b-1de0d3c358d8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efd5673d-fe77-4c24-89c4-e3cce14e1024.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cd655fe9-7a3c-49bb-81d4-cd6f43f3650b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Zork: The Undiscovered Underground","Overview":"This was a free game released by Activision to celebrate and promote their newest game, at the time, Zork: Grand Inquisitor.

The chef can temporarily freeze those nasties by throwing pepper at them to make them sneeze, or he can squish them under a falling burger part.

It’s like we used to play it in the 80's. Each player (you and the computer) gets the same number of cards. Each card represents a retro computer and has several values like year, memory and colours. Each card has its strengths and weaknesses. If a computer has a lot of memory or colours, he usually is not that old and therefor would likely lose in the year category. Usually the higher value wins. The year category is the only category where the lower value wins. The player who gets all cards first wins the game. \n \nReleased at the Vintage Computing Carinthia $06.\n\nSupports both 40 and 80 Column.","Publisher":"Public Domain\/Freeware","ReleaseDate":"2020-03-21T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"192467":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Snake"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maurice Jones","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"b8f6f558-5a16-4d83-b5d4-0cb0b1bb6ee7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Snake (J & F Publishing)","Overview":"A Solitaire game published in Loadstar #141.","Publisher":"J & F Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1996},"195247":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Oziphantom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ceaad85e-f873-406a-8847-9a1a0d437e99.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2cab9b26-1b48-4e5d-a031-349191a50202.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0a11e50a-d1c8-4db7-b2e5-446b7a256ac4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hose It Out Deluxe","Overview":"Great 80 column screen C128 game, nice soundtrack,","Publisher":"Protovision","ReleaseDate":"2020-11-28T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"200574":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fredrik Ramsberg","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"10b84a93-2e47-47ce-b490-5495088df262.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mini-Zork II","Overview":"Infocom released Zork 1, 2 and 3 in the early 80s. They were all made to be playable on the home computers of the day using a disk drive.\n\nAs some of you are aware, they also created a cut-down version of Zork 1, called Mini-Zork 1, which was just small enough to fit into memory on a C64, so that it could be distributed on tape. This game was sold for a while in the UK, and possibly in some other markets. It was also included on a cover-tape with the C64 magazine Zzap! 64 in 1990.\n\nA lesser known fact is that they created Mini-Zork 2 as well, a cut-down version or Zork 2, small enough to fit in the memory of a C64. For one reason or another, they abandonded the project when it was sort-of-completed and mostly working.\n\n30+ years later, the source code of all their games emerged, including this project. Torbjörn Andersson has put in the work to fix all bugs he could find in this game. Before he started, it definitely wasn’t possible to play the game to completion. Now it is.","ReleaseDate":"2021-03-19T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"}}
