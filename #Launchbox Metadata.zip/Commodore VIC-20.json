{"Name":"Commodore VIC-20","Games":[{"DatabaseID":168911,"Name":"3 Deep Space","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"To return back to Earth if your ship is beyond the Starfields of Orion there is an avenue of beacons placed by the Elders of Earth to guide ships towards and through a Stargate. Unfortunately, Earth's enemies, the Andromedan's have launched a huge Starfleet to enter the Stargate and invade Earth. You have been tasked to guard the entrance of the Stargate to destroy as many of the Starfleet as you can and above all, stop any Dragon Class Starcruisers containing their Battle Commanders from making it through.\n\n3 Deep Space is a side view shooter with the whole game shown on the screen and you must blast as many ships as you can who move down the screen towards your craft at the bottom. If you touch any ships or allow a Dragon Class Starcruiser past yourself then it is game over. The main selling point of the game was that it was in 3D and used 3D glasses provided with the game. As well as moving left and right along the screen, you could actually move in and out of the screen as well. The enemy ships moved down the screen at different depths of the screen as well.\n\nThe VIC-20 and C64 versions came on the same cassette with the C64 on one side of the cassette, and the VIC-20 version on the opposite. The VIC version however, does require an 8K RAM expansion.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWdLRF59uaU&list=PLETIxHfs6dO667fvxqNPAojbGFntP0AEe","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Mike Singleton","Publisher":"Postern Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"be05de88-1ca9-470f-a566-91cf1c29d73d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"1539e0a0-31c9-47f6-ad41-5ddea4a7cb7d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"8f0956f7-26dd-44bb-9182-7421ad3b0cf5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"9cb66049-03b3-410f-a9dc-d6c302cae773.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"889a47ed-56d2-4323-9306-559126d80484.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"652b31c8-62ca-4635-a397-376f2202a14d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"0bcf23bc-e217-4d1f-8092-2ac79ff25e65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168911,"FileName":"09f61743-372d-436c-898d-140898b64eeb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180972,"Name":"3D Doolhof","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A Dutch 3D maze game written in BASIC and requiring a 3-kilobyte memory expansion, like the Superexpander.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Public Domain/Freeware","ReleaseDate":"1995-02-19T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":180972,"FileName":"139865d7-c4b4-4ff7-83d8-aa6a8a9d48f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":180779,"Name":"3D Labyrinth","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Escape from the first-person maze.

The player navigates through the maze with his vehicle while looking for silicon that floats with the stream. Collecting the silicon is done by positioning the vehicle towards the part where the silicon will pass and throwing out a net to catch it. The player is however not alone in the maze. Around him something called kryllon forms out of thin air and explodes after a short while. If the player then is within range of the explosion he will be killed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jha5zoQFeM","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Chris Stamp","Publisher":"Thor Computer Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164139,"FileName":"c448cfdb-f662-44da-adf2-f23e00bfdea5.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164139,"FileName":"bc57ce2c-2d5c-4f7b-a4fa-f8860720955e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164139,"FileName":"2fbd334c-b0d9-479e-b45b-708e47107464.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164139,"FileName":"8cc63e92-fe5d-4412-bbef-d5f904ce53bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164139,"FileName":"5b9e403c-e0e7-47bd-9057-842d71864abb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164139,"FileName":"9781e535-f7db-4ef3-93d8-ae504e7ca7c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164139,"AlternateName":"Silicon Fish","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":164138,"Name":"3D Time Trek","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You are a survivor of the planet Corillian after space pirates launched a devastating raid.

As you hit the pods, they break into smaller independent chains. The aliens seem to have a sense of humor, though. Each pod in the chain coming at you looks like a...camel. Flying camels from outer space.\n\nAs you start shooting the camels, you are attacked by guns from the bottom of the screen and from the left side of the screen. Even worse, a human traitor has joined the aliens, and when he appears on the screen, running across the grid on top, the guns get very accurate at shooting you. Luckily you can shoot traitors.\n\nOther twists include deflectors, which turn your bullets and even ricochet them back at you. The enemy fires back too. And as you advance in level, the enemy changes the direction of their attack.\n\nNot to be confused with Advance of the Megacamel which is also called Attack of the Mutant Camels in Europe.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km90lOgu2ec","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Llamasoft Ltd.","Publisher":"HesWare (Human Engineered Software)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"9db2532e-65c4-4bf5-b1d1-b1d868da247d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"59e463a3-cee7-4592-a498-f4922c9aa369.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"ad6d8e11-bbf7-469b-abba-916893caa130.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"30ee62a1-f3b8-4683-907f-5ecd1c201dfd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"3d083664-2e35-4eb2-a267-a302cd6a5f8b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"76646254-7a9c-49df-9d2e-ba831667740a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"8d7b580f-5fb7-476d-b9fc-55717435597f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"3c7171af-9752-4586-89bd-1089f168c8e7.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"543257f6-2247-4657-bed2-e91178733d3e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"da5a156f-a6d8-4de6-8bad-4e88d9616fee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"a26c746a-ef84-432e-83fa-5ce2b5537f3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"FileName":"fc0feebb-c27f-42b4-9803-51dd786922ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164205,"AlternateName":"Matrix: Gridrunner 2","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164205,"AlternateName":"Matrix","Region":"Europe"}]},{"DatabaseID":200048,"Name":"Attack of the PETSCII Robots","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Attack of the Petscii Robots is a top-down action/puzzle game.

It is also capable of castling, queening, and ‘en passant' and operates on standard chess nomenclature.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy; Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Audiogenic Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"a9c1f395-cc30-4e4b-aaee-5e8bd8a4a692.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"34ce415f-ff0c-40af-91d6-bdc8e7e266f5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"cb9bd446-63d6-47e2-839f-9128b1b957c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"896999de-ce30-49b2-b859-4f3d2ef9710d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"f1c82d4c-bd11-4173-a7db-66bece1e734e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"c804a2cb-0b2f-460a-8e62-d057d4ade92d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":184317,"FileName":"7d138084-d934-4f26-8d6e-e6cece46d314.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199443,"Name":"Bricks","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Game description: In Bricks it is your goal to get to the top by climbing up bricks.

Controlling the ship involves side scrolling to the left or right, stop, moving forward (and faster), and moving backwards/break (and slower). Additionally, the spaceship can also fire its weapon to unleash a pair of energy bolts.\n\nThe player starts in sector 1.0 and will finish this level after the player successfully goes between an allocated number of pylons, indicated at the top left side of the screen; the first requirement is 9 pylons and will gradually increase with each new sector. In sector 1.1., with the addition of having to complete the pylon requirement, a group of flying saucers, ranging from 1 to 4 (per group), fly in a pattern. The player must avoid these flying saucers by maneuvering out of their way or by shooting them down. In sector 1.3., a new type of robot spaceship (at least one) will fly erratically and attempt to crash into the player's space ship (due to the marvel of technology of that era, enemy ships that disappear from one side of the screen, will emerge on the other side of the screen). Later sectors will gradually introduce more difficult challenges.\n\nThe game ends when the player loses all three lives by crashing into (or being crashed by, it seems sometimes) pylons or enemy space ships. Although there is no penalty in avoiding pylons altogether, the game will also end if the allocated amount of time (indicated by a long bar at the top center screen) runs out. The player may increase speed to move faster, which will present maneuverability challenges in itself. The overall score increases by distance traveled, pylons traveled through, and enemy spaceships shot down. The latest score and the high score are saved and shown in the main menu.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-DZ7JPp3Wk","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sega Enterprises Ltd.","Publisher":"Sega Enterprises, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1983-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"e068ce55-edb9-4701-8ce1-a317390a8157.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"45961f0b-b57e-43fe-b0f6-4218119448ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"c8afe696-d7fe-4263-b6ad-171b5e6fcd60.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"219c0264-36aa-48a2-a9af-8c195f6e7188.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"6699bcd3-5742-4771-852f-7e4022b02dc9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"9f31707b-559d-4838-9b3d-2d54a72a90e0.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"24fa3ac2-13ec-4ad5-b2fc-8a826302d830.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"cb299aa8-52a1-4f0d-b539-77b25f1ecb6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"8048b951-f2f9-4ccb-a89f-db094f03e60a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168192,"FileName":"47d701a7-94c9-44d9-972c-580ad7bad45f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176243,"Name":"Bug Diver","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Bug Diver is a single screen game viewed from the side where you are a bug who has to keep diving to the bottom of the sea to retrieve eggs.

Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves.\n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands.\n\nInsect Opponents and Mushrooms\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\n\n    The Centipede\n    The Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\n    Attacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\n    The Spider\n    The Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.\n\n    The Flea\n    The Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\n    The Scorpion\n    The Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\n    Mushrooms\n    Mushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom.

The game consists of several different screens: when beginning and between fights you will see a view of the path that leads to the monastery. Walking along the path, you will encounter numerous enemies. When fighting, the view switches to a close up of your current location. By pressing the joystick button and moving the joystick in one of four directions you can perform various kicks, punches, and blocks. The enemies you encounter are varied, and some can only be defeated by certain moves. The path you walk along will occasionally split up into two or more choices; when this happens, only one choice is correct and the others are dead ends. If you choose incorrectly, you'll have to back track a bit and try again. Beginning as a white belt, you will slowly increase in rank as you win fights. By the time you reach the monastery you need to earn black belt status in order to defeat the deadly ninjas inside! Your quest must be completed within a time limit, or the game is over. Walking off of the path or losing fights will also cause you to lose even more time.\n\nWas also sold as part of a double pack along with Artillery Duel.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgewcC5DzHo","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Xonox","Publisher":"Xonox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"32fbf21e-08dc-4d45-beca-0ec07c07b2a0.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"f83494fb-580d-4d29-a267-16b3ded987ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"a3dc79fe-49c4-463d-9bff-0e3dc2c88238.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"98da3ea2-1944-4a1f-8900-65a6e9f48c96.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"ec8d3afa-cf70-4575-9918-88e7e59b2adc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"80e15912-83c9-4c5c-b1e4-e739528c965f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"a2006d6f-f83a-44e2-9eda-dd816ebc75bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"b339596f-c030-4bb0-8715-da68136b9d0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"fc166044-bf13-4f52-904c-cb80c4e1f420.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"0c48b012-1275-4912-ac14-c4f08614288a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"e1e3abec-972d-44f2-80ce-8181982b135a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"16e5ab59-08be-41d9-ad6f-b8c8b9c24db4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165188,"FileName":"340d0a24-177c-4490-9574-3ac4683b641e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164893,"Name":"Cloudburst","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Defend yourself and your Earth base from the attack of deadly Acid Rain and pollution spawned mutant creatures called Cloud Hoppers.

Changing lane can only be done at intersections located in the middle of each straight. Hitting a divider when doing so will lead to the player losing control of the car for a short moment. The player has three cars and when they have all been crashed the game is over.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B534KR2IkPQ","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Racing","Developer":"Scott Elder","Publisher":"Nufekop Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165223,"FileName":"ee96ba09-1af1-4cd3-8b3e-428ed9e3b247.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165223,"FileName":"2904f3f6-f080-4932-b691-d5d5236b1c85.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":165223,"FileName":"0bcd4833-42ff-4f5f-8d0d-53acceaf39c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165223,"FileName":"dff826d4-a079-46a8-b485-4622f5354414.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165223,"FileName":"17e44f4c-d159-4867-bb29-55702cc5256e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165223,"FileName":"9d628863-f6e8-4d5d-b2f3-1d6c086fc062.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185274,"Name":"Colonel's House","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You have to retrieve a knife from a booby trapped house before the owner returns to his house.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Rabbit Software","ReleaseDate":"1984-06-04T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185274,"FileName":"cdba1b62-9430-4eb9-9cb6-eec85dd13eee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":185274,"FileName":"33d7c733-d4b2-4d49-b5bd-b83f2258f906.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185274,"FileName":"d234da8a-66c4-4bd7-a222-829f68e71f7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185274,"AlternateName":"The Colonel's House","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":165073,"Name":"Computer War","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Based on the movie War Games, the game is in three parts\n1/ Map screen, of USA, where you need to click on the incoming missiles with the joystick \n2/ Zoomed in area of the missiles where you shoot down the missiles\n3/ Puzzle screen where you must match a portion of a pattern to a larger screen to crack the code\nAny failure of shooting down missiles or puzzle will move the DEFCON (Defense Condition) countdown from 5 to 1.

The player starts with three lives and will lose one if Rick falls into a crater or is hit by a flying object. Rick's supply of oxygen is limited, but more oxygen can be obtained by picking up canisters that are strewn about the asteroid's surface. If Rick runs out of oxygen, the game will end. When the 20th screen is reached, a bomb must be dropped in the large crater. Once the bomb is dropped, the player has only three minutes to guide Rick back to his ship before the bomb explodes. If Rick's mission is successful, the player will earn an extra life and proceed to a more difficult asteroid.

The object of the game is to survive as long as possible by defending your star base from enemy star cruisers and deadly satellites. The game has 99 levels of difficulty, and the player may begin at any level from 0-10.\n\nThe player's star base is located at the center of the screen and enemies firing light missiles will approach from all sides. The star base is armed with lasers that can be fired in all four directions, as well as a limited amount of anti-matter bombs which destroy all on-screen enemies. Shields can also be activated to intercept enemy shots. Firing lasers and using shields will use up energy, and if the player's energy runs out, their star base will explode. If the player does not destroy enemies or intercept their shots, their missiles will inflict damage to the player's star base. Shields will be rendered unusable on any part of the base that is hit by an enemy. The star base will be vaporized if the enemy shots penetrate the reactor at the base's core.\n\nThe player starts the game with three bases and will earn an additional one each time a level is completed. Additionally, any extra energy remaining at the end of each round will be converted to extra points. When all of the player's star bases have been lost, the game is over.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Tk-ukiDeSQ","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Alan Pavlish","Publisher":"Boone Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"20bb1e2c-5152-42da-a75f-fc58f3acedc9.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"717edae9-ea34-464e-af09-9783d7bcbfa2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"d1fdc400-132b-4eec-b536-54d355416bec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"e0a1753c-dfcd-477c-8040-ac49ffeec278.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"d212ad23-6dcc-4054-95da-524967d8b867.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"ba7361f3-5702-42c7-99d3-d7bd806e45d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"d2b969f9-7349-4eff-9f1e-8531c307266a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164129,"FileName":"cfa01cb8-03c0-4aa9-bb5c-4ce553717747.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176189,"Name":"Cyclons","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Cyclons is a single player space shoot-em up game.\n\nThe player takes control of a space ship and must shoot alien ships in order to gain a high score.\nThe game allows the player to customise the gameplay, the terrain may be turned on or off, the player's shots can be set to ricochet from the edges of the screen and there are four levels of difficulty.\n\nThis game is played with a joystick.

The crabs grab bricks from the sides and try to drop them on the player-controlled duck. It is possible to shoot the crabs and the bricks as they fall, but if a brick lands on the duck, he dies. When a brick lands on an empty spot, it will stay on the pond for a moment, preventing the duck from moving horizontally.\n\nOn levels two to four there are two, four and six dragonflies, respectively, moving together just under the crabs. The player receives ten points for shooting the dragonflies, but this makes them angry. When angry, they drop one, two or three bombs (depending on the level). If the duck is next to a bomb when it explodes, he is killed. The game continues until the player runs out of ducks, which are equivalent to lives in other games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gq3pa5t80Ls","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Ed Hodapp","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"2660722e-c404-4c30-ab81-a75aedff1fbb.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"e985497b-3a7b-4054-811b-648199b9d39a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"6af06120-6a8f-456c-a3c6-d96a6c75da8e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"afa84ea0-a59b-41fb-89b4-3e746a028f22.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"54b5554f-60af-45a2-b669-0f629eeb76b0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"94759325-62e2-4d49-9e45-d03e297c577c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"95a8f7cd-39c5-43bd-94fa-872f2bdc64a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":166623,"FileName":"0611c8bc-b873-44b0-a11b-caa7959efc86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168221,"Name":"Deadly Skies","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Deadly Skies you fly an attack helicopter against an array of military installations and anti-aircraft missile sites. Joystick controls allow you to move your chopper to track the targets below or to avoid the rapidly increasing volleys of fire from all around you.\n\nThe obstacles you must overcome are asteroids, smart bombs, anti-aircraft missiles and even UFOs that are working hard to destroy you because you have been assigned to take out their missile bases.\n\nAs you improve and destroy the targets on the ground, the game moves you up to a higher level of intensity. On some of the levels, you encounter mostly smart bombs. More than a dozen can be in the air at a time. You will be forced to spend most of your time in evasion, unable to aim your bombs. Rockets are fired at you by in heavy numbers, several volleys at a time. With the skies packed with missiles, you will find it hard to thread a safe path, even though they aren't homing in on you.\n\nThe reward of reaching the higher levels are the banks of asteroids slicing through the air in deadly clusters. Even though you collect a point for each hit on them, they very effectively block your attack against the targets down below.\n\nAt the 17th (out of 32) level of the game, the speed of the game increases twofold, making it twice as dangerous flying, and throwing off the timing you gained in the first 16 levels. By that time, you will most likely have earned reinforcement helicopters to carry on the battle (one for every 10,000 points).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blccmLbkcA8","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Thomas Kim","Publisher":"Tronix Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"ce87cd2d-abcd-48f6-9f00-90ff7fcb8d15.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"6a5a3bda-a478-4071-8d0e-d99368010e30.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"f067b016-41cb-462b-9348-f9ce909c1114.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"ddc82f57-cf10-495b-9176-28c694c72256.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"796fd1dd-a5ec-4f58-8303-a362235546e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"53171275-3d05-40dd-bf80-993f626b2412.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"7b1f9c69-5189-4642-b963-113413076db5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"fd0c6641-a96b-4a2f-b6ff-407943a7e3e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"7382c33c-b88d-485b-a3a1-7c7f2d042888.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"0bdc21fa-ae20-4261-a062-d3271ed3699c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168221,"FileName":"09cf1806-820e-4cc6-96ce-6d25fdbc5545.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176294,"Name":"Death Race","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"In this racing game you control your racing car through different screens during night and day at high speeds.

Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.\n\nAlong the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, \"living\" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.\n\nDonkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Br3tQ1DsWg","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Nintendo Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":"1983-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"f5b33ed3-7f7e-4848-9171-424fd28e15f3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"1d8c5ab8-7704-4c12-a8d5-f632cbda1795.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"e70ae1a5-7297-4e5a-9356-5ce52cd21a9a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"28cbd520-d0e1-4122-a5ce-1694ce71f86c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"1b7cc3cc-a31d-4ec9-8a1d-44c368200781.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"83ef06b1-b650-4b28-ad94-4add27113d38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"9807904b-4f7e-42af-92b9-6fd4eb599950.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"f82aebb1-9506-4f54-9616-aee7b26eca83.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"5ff94ed1-ccc6-411d-976d-27d1c45aa84d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164196,"FileName":"5541a997-7884-46ea-86da-289851a2dcc0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164183,"Name":"Doodle Bug","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Doodle Bug is a clone of the arcade game, Lady Bug, itself a close relative of the original Pac-Man.

Next to the city is a large dam full of water that also has to be defended. The helicopter can be moved in all directions and shoots bullets upwards.\n\nThere are four different types of enemies to shoot down. Munchers move horizontally towards the dam and make holes in it upon reaching it. If the hole goes all the way through the water will flood the city. Nasties appear from a mothership at the top and move downwards until reaching a building. Slideys do the same but move faster and from side to side.

As soon as the shot accurately hits the figure, he will immediately and safely return to the satellite.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8QrM-KtVEc","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Anirog Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176173,"FileName":"176b2118-1022-42fe-befd-bc8afd4ebdb3.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176173,"FileName":"421b3f42-ea0f-4ed0-b33a-dc9b4ce45b59.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176173,"FileName":"68de4d2b-616c-4e0b-840a-dd1078e05e2a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176173,"FileName":"e59b6e9c-88fe-4c85-8786-af104c7606e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176173,"FileName":"fae62ff9-d4aa-47b1-8b8d-0102047344bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176173,"FileName":"b0a6c844-5154-4253-8dfc-dcf759eb9474.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":176173,"AlternateName":"Galactic Abductors","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":176249,"Name":"Galactic Blitz","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Galactic Blitz (known as Space Phreeks in Europe) is a single player Galaga style shooter game where the player is faced with arrays of invaders that require destruction to earn points and to survive.

There are some monsters (snakes, toads, centipedes, spiders) which you need to shoot, and of course canl kill you. There are flashing items you need to pick up (for points only); if you accidentally shoot them (which will happen due to the speed of the game), they will disappear and reappear elsewhere. Finally, there are small yellow spider eggs which, if not destroyed, will hatch small yellow spiders, and these spiders will, if not destroyed, finally evolve into blue spiders, which you can not destroy, only paralyze for a while and then there are also black spiders, which are invincible.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYNNJd9GEMQ","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Rick Madge","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":155858,"FileName":"f7cb2cc5-8145-41d6-9406-da4460182941.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":155858,"FileName":"a8dfb946-8370-4b52-ac0d-64dd815d990d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":155858,"FileName":"a9ef3b6d-5a12-4d08-847a-9e12116b17ca.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":155858,"FileName":"c73805e9-607f-4acf-9013-14150a2e8134.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155858,"FileName":"f7dd73ba-d686-447d-ad73-f4662b1d0aa2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":155858,"FileName":"e1951532-dc62-4458-b157-534aa0c953bb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176175,"Name":"Get Lost","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxLVpz--Bew","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"R.W.

There are five different screens you need to get past before you can rescue your friend from the top floor of the manor. The game begins in the graveyard outside the manor; here you play tag with a friendly rainbow ghost or skeleton which will supply you with spears you can fire at enemies. In the second screen, you approach the guarded entrance of the manor. Using the spears you collected, you need to shoot all of the enemies blocking the entrance. The third and fourth screens take place inside the manor; each floor has a set of stairs as well as several treasures and crosses which can be collected. There is a moving wall on each of these floors which is deadly to the touch, so be careful! The final screen is the top floor of the manor where your friend is being held captive. Dracula guards this floor, and using the crosses you collected earlier you need to repel him into a prison and free your friend. To make the game more challenging, there is a time limit; you must complete all of this in four minutes or less! You can play the game as either a boy or a girl, and four different skill levels are available.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeM-T8-DgUw","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Xonox","Publisher":"Xonox","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"f5396a0b-f6d0-4d57-a711-4b83ad0531ef.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"d74fc7e4-ccdb-43d8-bcc3-b94caefc771e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"1d9cc780-05cb-4c67-a644-43a553b95939.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"a35ebaae-c515-4368-a36a-2653c68bfb3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"9f71515c-0d2c-46b8-9c1b-688dab31443d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"c01187f7-07f5-4772-a29a-3ed154f34ca7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"d85b31ca-6af0-4ff9-b79d-fc4a42ef280f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"5bb3a838-a58a-4563-ba63-c894d3c8007c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185354,"FileName":"8adb44c3-0fa2-4250-86ab-f4a281cec70f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168880,"Name":"Gold Fever!","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Gold Fever! is an action game with platform elements in which the player controls a miner searching for gold. At the beginning of the game the miner is at the uppermost tiers of the mine. Scattered around the five levels of the mine are little piles of gold. The goal is to move towards them and pick them up. To move the miner safely from level to level the player steers him up or down the vertical shafts in the floors. There are complications, such as runaway ore carts, which interfere with the miner's progress by knocking him down. Three collisions and the player is out of miners, ending the game. The miner will be able to jump over the obstructions if the player times the jumps perfectly. This adds from 30 to 40 points to the player's score. If the miner can cross a chasm by running across a boxcar, he earns another 20 points.\n\nThe miner's troubles also include having to jump over a murderous claim jumper who will, from time to time, ambush him. Sometimes it is also necessary to leap over boulders. Moving from one tier to the next before the rocks appears on screen doesn't help the player evade them; they always appear on the same tier as the miner.\n\nOnce the miner has collected all the gold on the screen, he can make a run for the exit at the lower left of the screen and begin the process on the next level. Each of the nine levels becomes increasingly difficult as the player proceeds. The miner needs to collect more gold on each succeeding level, the obstructions are faster, and as a result the player must change the timing of the jumps. The oxygen supply is limited, and slow-moving miners tend to suffocate.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g1tcVhGKx4","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Corey Ostman","Publisher":"Tronix Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"13d62f22-61a9-4f49-adb6-bca9761f8bec.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"7db6a6d5-c6e4-4362-bdf8-401246ed3113.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"6bd6afb9-353d-4d24-a8ff-d62334afd438.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"4b0e3657-4974-40fa-bd56-9fa56ec0cb31.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"6c17773f-068d-46f1-9377-fa0a009c6432.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"f7b7a4bb-b3f5-4862-bb68-df192a3f61e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"d0a66a89-a003-4a36-b80c-1f241de3dba6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"90c3ac0f-49ac-4414-9f1b-f432c893463c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"8d012352-5da0-42fc-b053-fe54b8afe87c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168880,"FileName":"a61298e5-6f72-49f8-95ce-30e32a6b1eb1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168880,"AlternateName":"Gold Fever","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":176185,"Name":"Golf","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"A 9-hole golf game developed by Trevor Pitts and published by Audiogenic Software in 1983","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Trevor Pitts","Publisher":"Audiogenic Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176185,"FileName":"9a1903e9-f41d-49e9-bdb7-0f3017a47be4.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176185,"FileName":"9135288a-88cd-4d7c-b105-82ad9528b763.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176185,"FileName":"850d2c04-c631-4d95-b333-699840357c12.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":176185,"FileName":"59b1f2cc-3847-428f-8213-2d639b0422ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":176185,"FileName":"9c32753e-8f69-4708-873b-29a2dcdc944f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":90756,"Name":"Gorf","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"The player controls a spaceship that can move left, right, up and down around the lower third of the screen. The ship can fire a single shot (called a \"quark laser\" in this game), which travels vertically up the screen. Unlike similar games, where the player cannot fire again until the existing shot has disappeared, the player can choose to fire another shot at any time; if the previous shot is still on screen, it disappears.\n\nGorf consists of five distinct \"missions\", each with its own patterns of enemies. The central goal of each mission is to destroy all enemies in that wave, which takes the player to the next mission. Successfully completing all five missions will increase the player's rank and loop back to the first mission, where play continues on a higher difficulty level. The game continues until the player loses all their lives. The player can advance through the ranks of Space Cadet, Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and Space Avenger, with a higher difficulty level at each rank. Along the way, a robotic voice heckles and threatens the player, often calling the player by their current rank (for example, \"Some galactic defender you are, Space Cadet!\"). Some versions also display the player's current rank via a series of lit panels in the cabinet.\n\nNote: None of the home ports have the Galaxians level due to legal issues with Namco, so all the official home ports only have four levels","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jThxF920jwU","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"473f1c07-065c-4a80-9fa1-a228dce73389.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"aed84d1a-d3cb-4761-9d43-dd7ad7025a2d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"bc8fa327-7004-404e-86be-5a7c01d23b20.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"51d969fc-1420-4243-8b1c-f56a24a7bf68.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Sweden"},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"39d3f4b7-78ca-47d3-b6c9-07286afba679.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"025c38c0-8c0b-4ec4-afef-992ebb8f2312.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"aa1ca893-4aa2-4db8-a875-a8ef547a1f9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"69447678-a10c-41f5-8a19-2bc998f29eb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"1af7f50a-34de-41ef-8717-ee504282ebdd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":90756,"FileName":"cd8a827c-78a1-4e2e-b6ba-9a5646a6bd56.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168560,"Name":"Grand Master","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Grand Master is a one player chess game where you play the computer at chess with ten skill levels (0-9).

The player must also avoid pulses emitted by the X-Y zappers which patrol the edges of the grid. The game has twenty waves of enemies to complete.\nThe player controls a small, constantly firing, ship that can be steered around the whole of the playfield with swipes of the iOS touchscreen. Various enemies appear on the playfield and will attack the player's ship. The game is divided into a number of levels (or grids) with set patterns of enemy attack on each grid. At the end of each level a bonus life is awarded and the next grid begins. To aid the player shooting certain enemies will release spinning coloured disks that increase the player's attacking powers, these power-ups are short-lived but collecting multiple disks will increase the potency and/or duration of the power-up. More enemy types are introduced as the player moves through the levels of the game, enemies also become more dangerous as the game progresses. The game can be played in Pure or Casual mode. In Pure mode the player has to start at the first level and progress through each level consecutively until all his lives are lost, after level 4 and every 4th level thereafter the game will create a save point. In Casual mode the player can resume the game at any of the save points he has created when playing in Pure mode with his score and lives set to his best performance at that point. Pure and Casual modes have separate high score tables.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtRFGEfA1NU","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Jeff Minter","Publisher":"LLamasoft","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"47d43ae1-1f03-4f81-a8b9-a35fc3da6e2c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"e9ef960a-f64b-4b37-b5a0-334ed544c859.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"f48d7e5b-80d2-4008-ac73-2f5ff518aa3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"f501ab42-66c3-4bf5-838d-9ce3e3af5b59.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"bb4abe99-e862-47c4-97ba-5e0518190f0d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"089910ab-87e3-4844-b314-20bad3ba7237.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"bd60d0fb-1e4a-432c-be80-664be95b486d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"81cf3c56-ac17-46f5-ad9f-90f15bcf81ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32491,"FileName":"048226d9-71e1-44e0-8357-79b1772b1c0c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165161,"Name":"Gridtrap","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Gridtrap is a single screen game where you have to move around a grid of squares to get to bombs to defuse them before a timer reaches zero for each bomb.

The amount of reels in the video machine is equal to three for ZX Spectrum, BBC / Electron and Dragon 32/64 versions, and to four for other versions.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKFzNnx_m-U","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":"Shaun Southern","Publisher":"Mr. Chip Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164170,"FileName":"92e86c78-b21b-450d-9114-c4cad5dbc592.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164170,"FileName":"aab5866b-8845-4920-90ed-97c200927456.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164170,"FileName":"8d50ec3e-572e-4976-a80f-2fe6b53bacf8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164170,"FileName":"d3a8b1bd-5d26-4f74-9e1e-75dadb20927d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164170,"FileName":"72831576-9c34-4aa0-9f9d-ee49409f1d17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164170,"FileName":"029e8633-b9d7-4fab-a35c-6c31dea66efe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164170,"AlternateName":"Vegas Jackpot","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":155832,"Name":"Jelly Monsters","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"A faithful clone of Namco's arcade hit Pac-Man for the VIC-20 developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Commodore Business Machines in North America and the UK, as well as Handic Software in Sweden.

A two page review of the game was written up in the December 1983 edition of Compute!’s Gazette. However, nothing in the review discusses its development. It does however provide a detailed look at gameplay.\n\nThe premise of the game is simple. A wizard stored up treasures in the dungeon beneath his fortress. He also created creatures called Gorbs to defend his treasure. You control a character running through the dungeon to collect treasures. The Gorbs chase you through the maze-like dungeon. It actually has a bit of a PacMan feel to it. You have to collect treasures spread throughout the dungeon rooms, and once you collect 12 a key will appear. You pick up the key and then have to make it to the door, which leads you to the next portion of the dungeon.\n\nYou are able to defend yourself against the Gorbs, but in a limited way. You can fire either to the right or to the left. The Gorbs also will not go near the treasures, so you are in a safe space when you get to them. You gain points for collecting treasure, shooting Gorbs, and by how quickly you complete each stage. There were four unique screens to work through and when you finished them, they repeated, only with more Gorbs moving at a higher rate of speed.

At the start the player has a good view of his surroundings and can locate the position of the mask. However, the player's lamp is not reliable and will go out after a short time. The tomb will then become shrouded in darkness and the player will only be able to see what he is next to. So thereby the game gets a lot harder if the player is too slow.

The Zzyaxians have set their sights on taking over a small outpost called OP/37 on the rim of the galaxy to launch their attack. Problem is there are just three Metallamas and with no help nearby it is up to them to thwart the attack taking it in turns to defend the outpost. The Zzyaxians have sent Cyborg Arachnid Mutants who will use their threads to slide down into the outpost and destroy the Llamas.\n\nYou play as the Llama who can fire a bolt at a 45 degree angle upwards. You must try to hit each Mutant directly, if you hit their thread then they will drop down to the floor, turn into a Weeviloid and scurry towards the Llama. If you don't hit a Mutant or it's thread then they will drop to the floor at a certain point and once again scurry towards you as a Weeviloid. Each bolt fired can bounce of the ceiling and walls though so if you fail to hit the Mutant sliding down you can still kill the Weeviloid. One touch from a Weeviloid though and you lose one of your three Llama's. There are 32 levels to complete and you must kill 18 Mutants/Weeviloids a level to move on to the next.\n\nMetagalactic Llamas: Battle at the Edge of Time is played on one screen with a side view. The game is a 1 or 2 player game where each player takes it in turn after a life is lost. You have the option to start on any level but the higher the level the more Mutants that slide down. As well as the main playing area you can see your score, lives and quota. You use a joystick to play.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_y4DiaGv1is","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Jeff Minter","Publisher":"Llamasoft Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1983-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"389cc04c-8010-4ec3-822e-934e7e02a473.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"ec78f3d3-42bb-451c-8ec3-e98e31af737e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"8926c5e7-52ad-454c-b177-6942a1233578.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"f442eb1a-bb1c-4417-bd08-ba2d68ee9d21.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"8bc3b14d-cfce-4ef5-aea2-a51481c6a774.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"50b3fc3c-91b6-4799-b3a0-8ddd57fde0fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"d18637d3-a3c1-4fcf-9e43-49a22770b7b9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"ea4121f1-63b4-4ff8-b72a-6de6d63c226b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"714e0ce1-e8ef-4231-844c-2b41fbed9d0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"c4b4f61e-6c58-4084-9c57-2a79f5b03713.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33310,"FileName":"83657dd0-0a4c-4d94-9aba-a89ae385c465.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33310,"AlternateName":"Metagalactic Llamas","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":164197,"Name":"Mickey the Bricky","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Mickey the Bricky is a Donkey Kong inspired platform game The objective is to pick up his lost tools on the building site and get to the top of the screen via ladders, avoiding rolling barrels along the way.

First you need to collect enough diamonds to earn 1,000 points. After you have enough points, you need to locate the flame spirit which is hidden somewhere within the mine. Since the mine is rather dark, you carry a flashlight with you which can be used to locate objects (such as treasure chests full of diamonds and the flame spirit.) Once you have the flame spirit, you need to find the entrance to the temple the crown is in. Offer the flame spirit to the skull spirit guarding the entrance, and you can get in and take the crown. Once you have the crown, you need to make it to the top of the mine before time runs out. To make this task more challenging, numerous cave bats fly around which can steal the crown. If this happens, you need to begin again! At the very bottom of the mine is a deadly spider; if you're not careful while exploring this region of the mine, you could become caught in it's web and be eaten.

The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Si3kgQThVEM","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Midway Mfg.

You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy \"Droid\" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.\n\nThere is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.\n\nYou control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.\n\nBouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces.

It takes place at Hotel Paradisio and on each of the hotel's floors the rat has to eat all pieces of cheese to be able to take the elevator to the next floor. At the same time it has to watch out for Waldo and the traps that he has placed all over the hotel. Any contact with Waldo or a trap will lead to one of three lives being lost but an extra one is granted after 10,000 points. There is a time limit too as the rat only has three minutes to move from the top to the bottom floor. The colour of the cheese changes over time and it's important to not eat it when it's black as this will paralyse the rat. However when it turns to blue it's worth double points compared to the orange one. Once the rat has eaten the big cheese in the basement the level has been completed and it will move on to a harder one. The difficulty level can also be chosen before starting the game.

One such young man is Englishman Ricky Rockman who aims to dig his way through the mines and return home with plenty of riches. It's not an easy job though. Not only has he watch out for falling boulders but also the vile creatures that patrol the mines. \n\nRockman is a Boulder Dash variant. The aim of the game is to collect all the diamonds for each level. Throughout the levels are also boulders and monsters that wander around. Boulders follow the laws of gravity and fall down when the player digs a hole below them. The player then has to be quick or he might be crushed by them. Boulders can also be used to kill the monsters. When all diamonds in a level has been collected a gate leading to the next will open. The player has three lives and they will be used if he comes into contact with a monster or is crushed by a boulder. There is also a time limit.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mepkBeQZpac","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Martin Srebalius","Publisher":"Mastertronic Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"0a24a770-8f96-465e-9512-2f20c47bd900.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"9069c53a-589b-4cdf-bf6b-313fb3d5d6ab.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"3d498201-fa2b-4c61-bb64-48cbf1504814.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"3296df7c-a0b5-4e70-8243-7fdbde62d570.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"086d6347-0e38-4593-a752-ecc2ce4e5a44.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"99a16466-bdb2-4d0b-be92-3315412c6e9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"0f45e982-c1c7-48e0-ac83-df18944236c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32496,"FileName":"46f25f1a-2456-43fb-b47f-e457767e3f0d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164179,"Name":"Sargon II Chess","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"The second of the Sargon chess games.\n\nIn this version, you can play the computer or another opponent.\n\nTo move, you type the piece's location then the destination; such as A2-A4 to move the far left pawn forward 2 spaces.\n\nIf you press a certain key, you can hide the board and see the moves that have been made so far.

The speed of your scorpion is better than most of your enemies, and the nasty stinger blast you have at your disposal is a rude shock to those after you, killing most instantly. These predators cluster around the target of your hunger, the frog eggs, and your stinger will often destroy the eggs you seek while you combat the vermin attacking you. These eggs are worth 3200 points each, and in the lowest levels you earn bonus scorpions by scoring 4000 points. You must bring back all four eggs before they hatch into crazed killer frogs which charge you with the intention of biting off your head. The best response is to stay clear of a frog until you have built up enough power in your stinger to immobilize him, then carry him back to your lair. There are 32 levels of increasingly quicker and more deadly vermin, and complexity of mazes.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiXnkx27NyY","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Jimmy Huey","Publisher":"Tronix Publishing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168006,"FileName":"f35d78e2-6964-4dba-96d5-28f6d88e7ab3.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168006,"FileName":"e7ed0d7f-3559-4bf6-9dfd-0f48a2846fff.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168006,"FileName":"60bf52d3-e9e6-4cc0-8c55-aeee2e49ff6a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168006,"FileName":"5aebacaf-524b-4fc6-b900-a2eb26ee616a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":168006,"FileName":"b3062b0a-5d1d-42e1-a80c-056f4957edf8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":168006,"FileName":"9429f929-c835-4541-96bc-28665d14b3a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164237,"Name":"Scram 20","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Scram 20 is a Scramble clone for the VIC-20.\n\nFly a small spaceship through a system of caves, guarded by missiles.

Instead of a Colt 45 Peacemaker, your weapon is the FSS Demona, perhaps the best starship in the depleted Federation fleet.\n\nThe Demona has shields, hyperspace drive, and deadly lasers which can blast a barbarian raider out of existence with a single shot. Their hits, by contrast, will just scratch her shields, which you can easily reinforce with more energy. Energy is the catch, though. Every shot and hyperspace jump consumes an appreciable amount, while life support drains the ship as steadily as a clock ticks. More than their lasers, the barbarians' maneuverability is their deadliest weapon. Get a little too eager with your rapid-fire lasers and you'll have nothing left for that pesky life support system. Take too long to destroy all the enemies in your patrol zone, and they'll slip through to lay waste to the Federation's most populous planets.\n\nA single supply ship exists, which you can visit as often as you need. Just make sure you don't run out of gas getting there or lining up with its fuel pod. Hyperspace jumps also take a certain deftness. While dogfights within a sector range across unlimited three-dimensional space, hyperspace is flat and there'll be no jumping with the Demona's nose pointing off the galactic plane. Heading and azimuth are on the main screen, which is dominated by a view of the starry void, complete with crosshairs. When you do jump successfully, those stars disappear, then slowly expand from a thin, horizontal line as you enter the new sector. Energy, shields, and sensor readings are packed into the main screen, too. Separately, a map is available showing enemy presence in the sectors you have scanned, along with the location of that vital supply ship.\n\nDogfights rest on interpreting the trajectory of the barbarian raiders in order to draw them into your crosshairs and meet them there with a slightly anticipatory laser blast. Fifteen levels of difficulty are available; at higher levels an occasional second raider in the sector can make their shots a genuine hazard. Nonetheless, the primary challenge of higher difficulty is life support's rate of energy consumption. With the energy level ticking down faster, each dogfight becomes a race to target the enemy raider and return to the supply ship while there's still air in your lungs.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbbMF2VggaY","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172848,"FileName":"277d3b70-d237-4bd9-a5a5-7cc417d1a9bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172848,"FileName":"80a16aeb-0270-4e39-92fe-8e97832e2d6d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172848,"FileName":"d0913dec-9fc6-4437-8d6f-df43802bf84d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172848,"FileName":"82a03445-af75-4ec9-94a8-451cc9f69eb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172848,"FileName":"cf7ba4d2-d77b-420e-9a92-196afe3a6997.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172848,"FileName":"4d165556-615d-47bf-ac57-e9775b44b0ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164187,"Name":"Shotgun","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Krypton Force","ReleaseDate":"1984-03-30T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164187,"FileName":"ef673940-87f1-4961-a6b0-0822038e7186.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":160347,"Name":"Sidewinder","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Earth is once again threatened by an alien invasion.

Here, the graphical style changes into a more technological one than the natural caves earlier on.\n\nThe fifth section is equally cramped, but with steep shafts which must be descended into or ascended from with precision, due to the speed at which you are moving.\n\nFinally, the sixth section is an infinite loop where you must bomb a single enemy construction before you run out of fuel.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuxAwtrV4Sw","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Stephen Hamilton","Publisher":"Anirog Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"afd350ad-0930-44dd-92a0-edab56824471.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"882bb30d-154d-4400-b906-7e4f729e53b7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"ea1de882-7d3d-47c2-82ed-05804566f797.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"b8b946ec-0577-4070-b5cb-63125ad446a8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"f37f13d7-1033-4a36-8a98-4b728a41c286.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"46f25d31-212d-4e6b-9719-769b343af186.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"40e7c522-d06b-4370-8b34-6c63eda79193.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"9144667d-18ef-4a98-9613-8d38dd6e4805.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"bbcfb7ab-bfc9-4cfb-848a-23fd3cbe1eef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"a055e897-b811-43f3-b6df-9789c9ba0e12.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"591b646c-5808-4fbc-b73b-3a221a706421.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164206,"FileName":"145d10b2-da1c-46fd-bd21-a31b76d3b9e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":200668,"Name":"Skramble!","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"This is an unofficial but commercially released arcade conversion of “Scramble”, the arcade game. Most games on the Vic 20 which were rather outstanding required 3k, 8k, 16 and even 32k RAM expansions, but Skramble! passed on this and ran purely on an unexpanded Vic 20. Looking at the game, it is quite an amazing feat to see this conversion pulled off in 3.5k of memory. \n \nFor those unfamiliar with the Scramble arcade game, the game involves you flying a ship over various terrain, avoiding rockets, fireballs and cave monsters. All you have to defend yourself is the ability to drop bombs and use laser cannons to fend off enemy attack. You have a limited fuel load, so you must pick up fuel pods on the ground by destroying them (rather bizzarely) to keep your levels up. You get several lifes, compared to just one in this Vic 20 conversion. In Skramble, because you only have one fire button to use, both the bombs and laser cannon fire is done together.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCTTIYuzgXk","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"R.W.

The caves are cold, however, and you have a limited amount of time to hide before freezing to death. Make it to the top of the path, and you begin the next screen. Here you climb up a rocky ledge.

The game consists of nine skill levels.\n\nUnlike the original Amok, Super Amok only came on cartridge.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBv05-oWfzI","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Roger Merritt","Publisher":"UMI (United Microware Industries)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165735,"FileName":"aa1f143f-2c58-4b0c-94ff-5deb31b01591.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165735,"FileName":"830f13c3-1a08-423f-8b98-5750bafe7b5d.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165735,"FileName":"af2b5508-1305-4a0d-851c-f98eb0667299.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165735,"FileName":"f09eb2a8-9175-4758-ade4-7603a26d5267.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165735,"FileName":"2a3da824-cf2f-4daf-b990-f1a3b6947656.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165735,"FileName":"91c94788-4ce3-41b2-9af3-123ef62c78da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185340,"Name":"Super Break Out","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Atlantis","ReleaseDate":"1984-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185340,"FileName":"8dff6153-18c3-4d8f-a80c-2f0be4935976.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185330,"Name":"Super Breakout","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Solar","ReleaseDate":"1984-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185330,"FileName":"8698a76e-738b-4185-bc75-dfcdac31877f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185332,"Name":"Super Games Pack 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Collection of 4 games, includes:\n\nBloxit\nCannonade\nRoad Rally\nSkittles","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Commodore","ReleaseDate":"1984-08-05T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185332,"FileName":"62d242af-fb83-42bf-a48f-5156c2b30e06.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":185334,"Name":"Super Slot","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Casino","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Commodore","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185334,"FileName":"96c50fc7-a331-42a6-a85e-bd77b9785bf9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185334,"FileName":"41282b3b-c76b-48be-b245-d2659ab3a01a.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185334,"FileName":"beebb89c-9fcd-48df-9a06-e28d44a6daed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185334,"FileName":"80c638f1-16fd-473e-9cd5-9c32f61fe46b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":185334,"AlternateName":"Superslot","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185334,"AlternateName":"VIC Super Slot","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":164564,"Name":"Super Smash","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"A breakout clone developed and published by CBM for their VIC-20 computer in 1982.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui2mysEzrb4","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164564,"FileName":"bfa8222e-2f40-4c9e-afd6-798b2dbd1eba.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164564,"FileName":"0da4cd7b-4385-444b-9f64-6bf47239e215.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164564,"FileName":"710a4eaf-67d8-49ee-ad8d-f86732f7be49.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164564,"FileName":"11b6bfa8-6d31-4ba6-9015-ba7225297596.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":196132,"Name":"Super Starship Space Attack","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Find 3 power units and leave evil spaceship.

The levels become progressively harder to survive as the player descends deeper and deeper into the dungeon. Each dungeon is covered in complete darkness that illuminates as the dungeon rooms and corridors are explored. When the Sword of Fargoal is successfully found, a clock countdown begins where the player must successfully escape the dungeon without it being stolen before the time expires, or the Sword is lost.\n\nThe warrior gains character levels by gaining experience points, which increase the character's fighting ability and hit points, (called Hits), as they progress through the dungeon. There are several items in the dungeon that help the character, which can be found in treasure chests or on slain adversaries.\n\nCombat in the game is controlled by the computer, and the player has no control over how well or how bad their warrior fights. A warrior can flee an attack at any time, unless they fall victim to a sneak attack (which is when a monster engages in combat before the warrior has a chance to move). The warrior can move freely about the dungeon, whereas monsters take intermittently timed steps.\n\nEach dungeon has a number of staircases that go up or down. In the iPhone version of the game, there are even slippery staircases that will move a character down two levels. Because each map is randomly generated, a level the player returns to will not be the same as when they left it. Stairs also provide an entry for wandering monsters that, over time, replace slain ones on a level. In the iPhone version of the game, floors stay the same on a single game, but change when the player dies or starts a new game.\n\nCharacters can find bags of gold scattered around the dungeon. The bags can be taken by enemies if they step over them. Gold can also be stolen from the character by humanoid enemies. If those thieves are killed, the gold is returned to the warrior. A warrior can only carry 100 pieces of gold, and Magic sacks must be located that allow the warrior to carry more.\n\nEach dungeon level contains a temple. Every time the warrior steps on a temple, their gold is sacrificed to their deity, which earns additional experience. In the iPhone version, shields the player is carrying will be renewed when they are blessed. If a warrior remains standing on a temple, it acts as a sanctuary where they become invisible to enemies around them.\n\nChests in the game are both a bane and a boon to the player. Some contain something useful, or contain a deadly trap. Some chests explode, causing damage, and others release crumbling ceiling or pit traps. A player doesn't know, however, if a chest contains a trap or a useful item, and must take a chance of encountering either. Chests can be picked up by enemies if they step over them. There are six spells that can be found in the dungeon.\n\nThere are several enemies in the dungeon. In general, \"human\" type enemies are more dangerous than creatures. Some new monsters appear in the iPhone version of the game, and \"human\" type enemies also carry (and use) treasure, such as potions. Often the game will describe whether the monster one encounters is strong or weak.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE9cUU9BV7k","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Role-Playing","Developer":"Jeff McCord","Publisher":"Eypx","ReleaseDate":"1982-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"891b0907-0e96-4058-ade9-8094117003e6.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"38b9fbbd-7241-4d00-96e4-6402181bbdf7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"defd1d10-e8ff-41ec-bcd6-c92fae35eee4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"aec9ca33-3d5f-4d8a-af89-98f7abd98ef1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"90a7eb86-86ca-4baf-b48d-86d016aa465c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"42a8576d-9299-4780-9da3-05f424b5fca8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"5d51283e-1894-4568-8893-bd10aa197302.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32492,"FileName":"61ef66b6-be98-423c-8e24-ac68bfbb4008.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":32492,"AlternateName":"The Sword of Fargoal","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":164236,"Name":"Sword of Hrakel","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In this rare text adventure for the VIC-20 you have to break a curse by defeating an evil mage.

Players look down on a battlefield of two-dimensional obstacles and maneuver their tanks to shoot and destroy each other. Each tank has nine points of armor, allowing eight hits before the final shot destroys the tank and hands victory to the opposing player.\n\nThe tanks start each game in heavy bunkers, so the first challenge is to move out safely away from the enemy line-of-fire. Plentiful obstacles and the tanks' moderate speed means play is as much a tactical challenge as one for the reflexes. Speed on the trigger can be very important, though, because when hit a tank is relocated randomly and any shell in mid-flight disappears. In a face-off this means whichever shell lands first wins. The trigger finger must be tempered, however, as each tank can only have one shot on the screen at a time. Over-anticipating your opponent can lead to reloading at the most inopportune moment.\n\nDifferent platforms provide very different play, from keyboard to joystick, color to black-and-white, as well as battlefield variations. On TRS-80's, the battlefield is fixed from game to game and obstacles cannot be destroyed. In all cases, a solitaire version is provided, putting the computer in control of one of the tanks. Its reflexes are very quick.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"00b7e980-fbfe-47d7-9790-85c6dcbcf199.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"2dec64af-ba88-460d-9879-925c044fad71.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"ddf3687b-9a5f-413b-881c-d48ac5667c98.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"c6f1eb9a-e302-4c09-8eff-f36c4b376081.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"19557c8b-dedc-4273-bf8b-311f6b7bd2c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"199bcc33-1533-4290-98ec-ae0a9f95e7e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185336,"FileName":"7e6655a3-441c-43d6-a60c-4053010d078a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165729,"Name":"Tank Gunner","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Tank Gunner is an action game, in which you have to shoot mines.\n\nPart of a complimentary cassette you got in Canada if you purchased your VIC-20 (along with the cassette deck), or just the deck alone from Canadian Tire.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ixiwWq5mjk","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","Publisher":"Commodore Business Machines, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165729,"FileName":"abc51a5f-c7a9-4ca9-8d0a-b48521dc0f61.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":165729,"FileName":"31163e11-0794-4beb-b621-89c0dfddf40f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Canada"},{"DatabaseID":165729,"FileName":"77c539fd-f45c-485c-8675-bef6b3b9cbef.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165729,"FileName":"4fab638e-e630-4b96-877b-75e618615aae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":199391,"Name":"Tank-War","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"In this Combat variant for the VIC-20, up to two players (blue tank for player one, red for player two) battle it out against each other in a field consisting of walls and other barriers.

Furthermore, the level maps are not randomized like in Rogue. Still, the gameplay has a lot in common with Rogue and other early dungeon crawls: A solo character explores a monster-infested, multi-level dungeon to grab some treasure, everything in top-down view.\n\nThe game starts at the Innkeeper by creating a new character (if you already played the game, you can use characters that you created). You get different stat values (in Dungeons & Dragons style) as well as an amount of money that you can spend on weapons, armor and other equipment. Alternatively, you can just enter the stats to \"import\" characters from other role-playing games (this is also used as a primitive \"save / load game\" mechanism).\n\nAfter character generation, you enter the dungeons. On the left, the current room of the dungeon is displayed; the character status and other info are displayed on the right. One thing that sets Temple of Apshai apart from other rpg is that the manual contains detailed room descriptions for each room (that may contain hints about traps or treasures), to create atmosphere despite crude graphics.\n\nYou move about and perform actions like opening doors, firing arrows, examining walls for secret doors etc. by pressing key commands. Moving is also done without cursor keys: You turn your character into the direction you want to go and then move him forward by 1 to 9 steps, also selectable by single keystrokes. But take care of fatigue: If you keep running all the time, your fatigue rises, and if it reaches 100%, you cannot move or act for some time -- which can be deadly in the presence of, say, a Giant Bombardier Beetle.\n\nEach room may contain treasures to pick up (sometimes just trash, sometimes gold, sometimes useful items), secret doors which lead to hidden parts of the dungeon and traps, which obviously should be avoided (you can try to search for them). Of course, you will also encounter monsters -- a variety of undead or giant insects -- which you have to fight using turn-based combat. Apart from the normal attack, there is also the thrust (which is more effective, but risky), and you can also fire arrows at distance or parry. To avoid a fight, you may also try to speak to them.\n\nIf you return to the Innkeeper, you gain experience, which increases your stats. Still, if you quit the game, the only way to save your character is to write down the stats on paper and re-entering them the next time you play.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Automated Simulations, Inc.","Publisher":"Epyx, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":185222,"FileName":"1c8c1f99-f76a-460f-9bd9-1c08cf4305e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185222,"FileName":"93247999-0b1c-4ba0-b38b-e014d49ef069.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185222,"FileName":"272878e8-a4c8-408b-8807-290a7f6e38bc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":185222,"FileName":"2cd05d61-eced-400d-a62c-cccdc56f4181.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185222,"FileName":"cd155ff0-c371-4cc1-8bee-abeb310761c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166691,"Name":"Terraguard","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Terraguard is a fixed screen shoot 'em up similar to Moon Cresta and Phoenix.

With time, the empire crumbled. The last survivor, named Drewan, lived for many years after and started to repent for the evils committed by the empire. He knew that eventually, he too would die, and so he prepared. A 400 room tomb was built, and populated with a variety of guardians to protect the amulet and stones. He also provided some spells as a way to defeat the guardians, just in case some future hero needed the power of the artifacts to be used for good...\n\nThe Tomb of Drewan is basically a treasure hunt in a maze. In addition to movement around the maze, the character can perform actions (labeled on-screen from A to W) by pressing the associated keys on the keyboard. Some of these actions are always available to the player, such as Taking an item, or attacking with your Sword. These actions have a yellow star next to them. Other actions such as Arrow or Removing a section of wall require the player to have a particular object or spell, and have a red star next to them when available.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to find the artifacts, and then return to the top left corner of the tomb. Each room contains 5 treasures and one guardian. The treasures can be taken by standing to the immediate left or right, and then facing in the direction of the treasure. Inspecting the object identifies it before being Taken, which is important, because only one of each type of spell can be carried at a time. Runestones provide special useful powers. For instance, the Earth stone allows Remove earth to be cast at any time. Gold may also be found, which adds to your encumbrance (reducing strength and speed) but may also be used to pay off the tomb lord.\n\nThe guardians that patrol each room may be of two types: warrior or magic users. Warriors will wound you only when standing next to you, while magic users fire spells once they are within five squares. Each type of guardian has three different colours, denoting how difficult they are to kill. Combat occurs by facing the opponent, and using the Sword, an Arrow, or one of the various combat spells (e.g. Chaos, Water, Fire or Petrify). Once your wounds exceed 100, you receive a visit from the tomb lord, who can be paid to resurrect you. If you have not amassed enough gold to make the payment, then your life is forfeit and you lose the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Audiogenic","ReleaseDate":"1984-02-21T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":185337,"FileName":"a0bde07a-c81b-49f8-8eb6-e6c6f21c68a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":185337,"FileName":"db2be307-f216-43df-9d1f-79e9a24b6cd4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":185337,"FileName":"86fc2b72-f692-44ff-9be3-f8db777b17c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32487,"Name":"The Wizard and the Princess","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Wizard and the Princess is an arcade adventure split into five stages where your quest is to rescue a Princess from an evil Wizard's castle.

You pilot a ship that is trapped within a chamber of seven tunnels. Your ship can only move up and down along a vertical corridor connecting the tunnels. You are not alone, however. A variety of enemies travel along these tunnels, focused on destroying you. Therefore, the ultimate objective of “Turmoil” is to zoom up and down the center alley and blast aliens as they streak by. Keep shooting and keep moving, and you will survive to live another day! As you move quickly up and down, you must also fire your own weapons into to the left or right side. Part of the intensity of this game is driven by the fact that you can't stay in one place for too long. If you do, an indestructible enemy will come flying at you, forcing to move onward once more.\n\nThe enemy ships you will encounter in each of the seven tunnels travel at a variety of unique speeds. The faster a given enemy moves, the more points you will receive if you shoot them. Occasionally when you destroy one of the enemy ships, a flashing orb will appear at the far end of the tunnel. This is the one exception where you are not restricted to your vertical pathway. In these situations you are allowed to move down the tunnel to recover it. If you grab it quickly, it is worth bonus points. If you hesitate, it hatches into a fast moving missile and will destroy you if you get in its way. When you start a game of Turmoil, you are given five ships. If you can blast all of the aliens in a level, you'll receive a bonus ship. In addition to your current ship, you can hold as many as six reserve ships at one time. You will loose a ship if you make contact with any of the passing aliens. There are nine levels to the game, each with multiple waves to complete, and each one faster and more challenging then the previous level. This is considered by many to be one of 20th Century Fox's best games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2AyNQaMLpDE","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sirius Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":202762,"FileName":"8f8ea5bd-2320-4a83-a1b8-53f7d8b388b1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202762,"FileName":"d476e05f-5dcb-43ec-85e0-8db7c8f8129f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202762,"FileName":"cb265011-feaf-4418-b888-0422522dc99b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202762,"FileName":"ecaf2d5c-b45c-42c9-9ebf-af9f0e3e6ee9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202762,"FileName":"397272d8-aa29-48cb-8b92-c3e895465ab7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202762,"FileName":"e7182a10-7617-4c22-ac7e-44b8bd07d2ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164226,"Name":"Ultima: Escape From Mount Drash","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"You have been imprisoned by the Garrintrots in the mountain stronghold of Mount Drash.

This led to a computer game starring Dunk and his mission is to destroy all the Titchies who have set out to destroy the biscuits themselves. Based on Space Invaders, the game is a single screen shooter viewed from the side with Dunk on the bottom of the screen and the Titchies at the top in formation. The Titchies mainly stay in formation but will occasionally move about the screen elsewhere. Moving left or right, Dunk has to collect a Weetarocket and fire it upwards to remove a Titchie while avoiding the bolts dropped from above. If Dunk is about to get hit by a bolt then he can make his Weet Force Shield appear to remove the bolt. The shield will always appear if a bolt is close to Dunk but if he doesn't make it appear himself then this drains his Neet Weet Energy. Moving about the screen and using rockets also drains his energy and lose it all and it is game over. Once all Titichies have been destroyed then it is onto the next harder and faster level. There are five levels in total and any of these can be selected before the start of the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4EKyfvzUgI","Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Romik Software Ltd","Publisher":"Weetabix Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164161,"FileName":"9b0ce51d-272d-4768-8afe-da9ca840ed63.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164161,"FileName":"34b10d7e-3790-486b-b1a7-07efeb2b011b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164161,"FileName":"ad032376-1127-40f7-8623-175bea3c22f1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":164161,"FileName":"28445d5f-021b-4508-8cf8-a5bf11718516.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164161,"FileName":"e66d4f6a-a97d-43cf-a1d4-bff98f1727fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164159,"Name":"Whirl Wind Rescue","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore VIC-20","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Comm*Data Computer House, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1984-06-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":164159,"FileName":"9b249618-f0d6-4bed-8fc1-26efe1255b43.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":164159,"AlternateName":"Whirlwind Rescue","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":164160,"Name":"Whodunnit","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Whodunnit is a murder mystery game for the Commodore VIC-20 which is loosely based on the board game Clue.
