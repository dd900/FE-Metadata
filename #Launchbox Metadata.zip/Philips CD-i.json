You have to collect souvenirs from various places as proof you've been there, and then get back to your village in time or else Caesar will win. It allows for up to 4 players or you can play against the computer. The game track has 54 squares that can be landed on which represent countries, challenges, prisons, magic potions, traps, rest, and meeting character opportunities. \n\nThe druid Getafix is host and will hand out magic potion flasks to players (except Obelix who, as fans of the comics know, fell into a potion when he was very young). You can acquire some interesting gadgets from the druid-spy Dubbelosix, that will help you move more quickly. To win the recquired souvenir items, you have to either answer the questions asked in the country squares or buy them from the Phoenician merchant Ekonomikrisis with sestertii won in challenge squares. The scoundrel Tortuous Convolvulus will also try to impede the players progress, so look out.","Publisher":"Philips Interactive Media","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995},"22978":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Axis & Allies"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capitol Disc Interactive","Images":[{"FileName":"5fb19ecd-706a-455c-b3f4-e96d1617a636.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bdddef2f-e10e-4efa-a14b-895febcb18a0.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e79a83db-9687-4609-bda2-d6d87e098420.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Axis and Allies","Overview":"Axis and Allies is a 1998 turn-based strategy video game closely based on the Axis and Allies: Classic board game.\n\nPlayers take control of one of five world powers at the start of 1942 in WW2, grouped into the opposing factions of the Allies (US, UK, and USSR) and the Axis (Germany and Japan). Victory conditions are set at the start of the game: complete world domination, the capture of enemy capitals, or reaching a set level of economic power by the Axis.\n\nThe game is turn-based, with the USSR turn first, and the USA turn last. Each power's turn of the game is broken into several phases. First is the research phase, where IPCs (a representation of industrial power) can be gambled in an attempt to develop advanced technology, such as jet engines or rockets. The remaining IPCs are then used to buy troops in the purchase phase. Troops are then moved in the combat move phase, and battles resolved in the combat phase. Non-combative moves are then performed in the non-combat move phase, new units are then placed at the powers' factories & IPCs for all territories the power now controls are collected in the place units\/collect income phase and the powers' turn ends.\n\nA second edition of the game was released in 1999 titled Axis & Allies: Iron Blitz. It added a function to allow the third edition rules of the game as well as new features such as allowing a submarine to submerge instead of withdrawal and having multiple AA guns occupy the same territory. In addition, it included many alternate scenarios, providing for events that ranged from a Western Allied-Soviet war after World War II (Allies: UK\/US vs Axis: Soviet Union\/(Communist) Germany), to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact being made into a formal alliance, which turns Japan into the Allies (Allies: UK\/US\/Japan vs Soviet-German Axis.) And, of course, there is the default scenario from the board game (Allies: UK\/US\/Soviet vs Germany\/Japan.)","Publisher":"Philips Interactive Media","ReleaseDate":"1994-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"22979":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capitol Disc Interactive","Images":[{"FileName":"ea42c020-9a70-4f60-9141-79f412f8a757.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"222bebc3-6cd3-4d01-83d8-d0103acf333c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"517cc63b-d219-436e-8d0c-150a61fabb64.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Backgammon","Overview":"Backgammon is a translation of the classical board game for the CD-i.

En route to Saturn, the Amazon is ensnared by a massive alien being resembling a large asteroid. The protagonist, Commander Jason Barr, is sent to investigate the incident.\n\nHe encounters heavy resistance on his way to Saturn, and after fighting through multitudes of alien ships, encounters the UNS Amazon almost completely absorbed by the organic asteroid. As he explores it, he comes into contact with what appears to be Captain Sumoki of the Amazon. However, she morphs into a demonic looking alien and attacks. Upon defeat, it reverts to the appearance of the Captain and Barr takes it back to the Moon base.\n\nThe being is examined and determined to be an alien clone. Upon interrogation, it reveals an alien listening base located on Tethys. Barr heads to Tethys to find the base and destroy its communication uplink. Upon his arrival he encounters a probe which proceeds to scan his ship before heading back to the base. Barr chases it through the valleys, where he locates the base. He manages to complete his mission and escape the base before it's destroyed. His ship, however, gets caught in the data beam and he is pulled up through it.\n\nRegaining consciousness, he pilots the ship through several pieces of debris and destroys an awaiting alien ship. His ship is badly damaged in the process and crashes into the alien mothership. With no means of escape, he searches the ship and engages the leader in battle, finally defeating him on the bridge. He then accidentally activates the ship terraforming ability, changing its coordinates from Earth to Mars. With this Mars is transformed into a second Earth, providing humanity a new home.","Publisher":"Virgin Interactive","ReleaseDate":"1997-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"23137":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3998aaf7-499c-4a43-a3e9-050c37c55dc3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"512495d0-7d2e-428e-95fd-79225449e7ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fd6fa70b-c590-45cb-8073-2410239977cc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Making the Grade","Overview":"Making the Grade is a simulation game that puts the player in the position of a general manager of BP (British Petroleum) that has been tasked to construct and run a chemical plant for a ten year period.
