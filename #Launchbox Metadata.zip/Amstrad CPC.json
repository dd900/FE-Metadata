The player controls Quasimodo from the Victor Hugo novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame.\nThe game is set on a castle wall. The player must cross the screen from left to right avoiding obstacles in order to ring the bell at the far right. Obstacles include pits which must be swung over on a long rope, ramparts which must be jumped (some of which contain knights with spears) and flying fireballs and arrows (to be ducked or jumped). Eventually, after completing a number of screens, the player must rescue Esmeralda. If this final screen is completed, the game begins again at a faster speed.\nThe hunchback character was originally to be Robin Hood. Hence the green costume and the game stages with arrows. The artist who drew the Robin Hood character left the company before the decision to change the theme to Hunchback. By the time a new artist was taken on, the green costume had become accepted and no-one questioned it (someone commented that the Robin Hood character, as drawn, looked like a hunchback).\nPorts were made for most home computer systems of the time by Ocean Software in 1984. It was their first arcade port. The exceptions to this are the BBC Micro version (which had already been released by Superior Software) and a later port for the MSX (1985)","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseDate":"1985-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8IAYwpRtnbA"},"18642":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e175ec31-d1d6-4a4e-9715-5397ae2eda15.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"55faec2b-0ad8-4895-b4d9-aaf6649f79f2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"380a68ac-a242-496c-956d-c5630864fb06.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"93127fe4-435f-4834-9101-e6d59623ae42.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a11f9ec-952f-4e86-a72f-19277f495ee3.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8da1a300-9836-4ffd-a3bf-548faab1f5aa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"96a4f534-730e-424d-8b36-da27b1fbcc04.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fb684a07-08c2-4af8-b95c-ab050448df9a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e18d7933-2c19-4b93-a33d-4642b61c9ead.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"02ac5423-a385-4396-82f6-0ce5b2ec697d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f6754854-3c9b-4ecd-92ca-2393c180137c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":1942,"Overview":"1942... you and daring fighter pilot \"Super Ace\" are engaged in realistic, thrilling and challenging high-flying battles with the enemy.

More heavily laden units may tire more easily, and may have to rest to avoid running out of action points more quickly in subsequent turns.

They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.","Publisher":"Taito Corporation","ReleaseDate":"1987-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y_aD7gfomQo","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arkanoid"},"27780":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"864c62c6-9c07-4fa6-b496-dc9f6774ec92.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e7e22de7-f6b4-48f8-abaf-ed63a563e324.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"945ff1a0-1e72-484d-9f13-f614d1858543.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"576f14ab-8389-413a-b839-6f071c9aa401.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"606481e8-6185-4fff-978a-056f6a8dc6af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9ff14e95-22b0-4e1e-8299-04b3ba8ec840.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8c335929-d10b-4d67-9bb2-7f8394156572.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2862cf72-6d49-448d-ba97-6dfaba2db548.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sonic Boom","Overview":"Sonic Boom is an arcade game shoot 'em up with a vertically-scrolling perspective in which the player is a US pilot, armed with the super-powerful Sonic Boom aircraft.

Dexter has been asked to go to the planet Kef and help the Swapi race. The Swapis have, until recently, been on good terms with their neighbors, the Stiffiens. But now, a new religious cult has risen among the Stiffiens, and the Swapis are in danger. The secret behind the cult lies in the Antines building. Before Dexter can investigate Antines, he must prove that the Swapis can trust him by solving three tasks.\n\nThe game is an isometric action adventure. Dexter must explore dozens of rooms, solve puzzles and deal with many characters, both friends and foes. A large number of items can be picked up, used or moved around to help overcome the obstacles. The three tasks set by the Swapis can be tackled in any order, but only once all three are completed the way to Antines opens up.\n\nThree kinds of creatures live on Kef. The Swapis are friendly and Dexter can talk to them and trade items with them. Stiffiens and animals are less friendly and must be avoided or destroyed. They can be lured into traps or killed using dynamite or a laser gun. Touching enemies lowers Dexter's battery power. If it runs out, the game is over, but it can be recharged by plugging into the mains.\n\nDexter's sidekick Scooter is more helpful than in the previous game. By calling him and pointing to an object, Scooter will fetch that object.","Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"28249":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Ghost 'n Goblins"},{"Name":"Ghost 'n Goblins"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9c17538b-c792-4529-a0b3-3d45dc4f654d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"999406ed-9fde-4890-9b01-1317475db74a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"400d49ca-cce0-49fc-b871-88cc48e49be3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f363bcc-0044-485b-9e95-aa069a694797.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2aa5df28-bd1b-4762-a165-65b64118dc29.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a2c87f64-3140-4987-99df-c10774f3d16f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9fbfb007-5fd3-49e1-be54-09dcfcf3e574.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"572938e3-69d7-410e-9ce4-6d4f79e74e46.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cde4d3c0-a19e-4ad1-8c4a-4f791361a721.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ce77e908-9517-4820-8e0f-1f36c87a3ebf.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"6cfddb7f-7e0c-4e65-84d0-0382014e8f34.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5088967f-85df-46c5-b8bf-417de73bca92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Ghosts 'n Goblins","Overview":"Ghosts 'n Goblins is a platform game where the player controls a knight, named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons, cyclops, dragons and other monsters in order to rescue Princess Prin Prin, who has been kidnapped by Satan, king of Demon World. Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.[2]\n\nThe game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.\n\nAfter defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was \"a trap devised by Satan\".

The game is a sequel to Renegade and was followed by Renegade 3. When acquiring the license to convert the original arcade game Renegade to home computers, Ocean acquired the option to produce and release their own home-computer-only sequels to the game, and Target Renegade was the first of these sequels.\n\nOn most formats, the game caters for one or two players and concerns itself with the adventures of a streetfighter (or a pair of identical streetfighters) known only as \"Renegade\", who seek(s) revenge against a local crime kingpin named \"Mr. Big\" for murdering his or their brother Matt. The player character varies, depending on the format, but is usually represented as topless apart from a leather vest and wearing jeans.\n\nRegardless of the format, the cover of the game and the title screen (as seen on the image to the right) portrays a topless street fighter performing a flying kick through a window. In keeping with video game box art and advertising of the era, the character shown in this illustration bears little relation to any character in the game itself. The actual picture is based on Martial Arts Legend Joe Lewis from the cover of his book The World's Greatest Fighter Teaches You How To Master Bruce Lee's Fighting System, but has been adjusted so as to fit in with the character of Renegade.\n\nThe game comprises five levels, though details of enemies and weapons vary from one version to another (the NES version in particular is more like Double Dragon than the home computer versions). The NES and C64 versions of the game do not have a two-player co-operative mode.","Publisher":"Imagine Software","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8_1aoLlcMko","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Target:_Renegade"},"28255":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Palace Software","Genres":"Action; Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"2e132901-7605-4620-9a0c-ef925575e6b8.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"81b19491-2247-4150-95bf-b44f10ffd2c4.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"62311e89-a189-4b4c-909a-2c5ba4a54a49.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"43080c46-4413-44ba-93d5-b45797b7714e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"db15ce84-f018-4a82-9f08-57e9d10e9b58.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce9b41d7-9213-460a-bc87-bee6cc62ce5e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"85bd2822-4205-4bef-8f7c-60e252ba1f71.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1eda9cf2-bf6c-44e2-b5d2-46ad8a67b0cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"782af91f-3f75-48a0-b963-33a981f08756.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6193bdc8-e92c-4eb3-a100-2cc5498873d8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior","Overview":"Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior is a fighting game that supports one or two players.

Areas of the game world set on the surface feature the witch flying on a broom stick, while underground segments require the witch to run and jump in caverns. In the flying segments, players must search for four randomly scattered coloured keys to access underground areas that contain six ingredients. The objective is to collect the ingredients and return them to the witch's cottage to complete a spell that can defeat the Pumpking. While traversing the game world, the witch encounters Halloween-themed enemies such as pumpkins, ghosts, skulls, and bats, as well as other creatures like sharks and seagulls. A collision with an enemy causes the witch's magic meter (which is also used to fire offensive projectiles at enemies) to decrease. The character dies once the meter is depleted. After dying, the character reappears on the screen and the meter is refilled.

It is an early example of the platform game genre, as the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, Mario (originally named Mr. Video but then changed to \"Jumpman\") must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline (originally named Lady), from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular and recognizable characters. Donkey Kong is one of the most important titles from the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, and is one of the most popular arcade games of all time.\n\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\n\nRegardless of initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and critically in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lNXLsobO3Gk"},"28269":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Broderbund","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1ce9af90-c69d-40e3-ae30-3fef5bf3cee2.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1a0bc303-15a1-4131-a869-efe226603e5c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4502de57-ee7d-4ff2-b022-3784ffb2d317.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3eeec11d-6348-4764-bdfd-49c3d914025d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7b03a6ff-3d14-47ad-b607-3a647e8c9162.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"250ad835-7650-4da1-bb16-93004d46b05c.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4f3f1596-2bae-4633-9842-b8a4fe572e68.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"adfe0cb1-31d5-49fa-bb60-7c8153bad2cd.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d784bfbd-5496-4815-8095-f7763d3dae01.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"81696533-5178-4af0-952e-1a21bf450417.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Prince of Persia","Overview":"Prince of Persia is a 1989 fantasy cinematic platformer originally developed and published by Brøderbund and designed by Jordan Mechner for the Apple II. In the game, players control an unnamed protagonist who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the Grand Vizier Jaffar and save an imprisoned princess.\n\nMuch like Karateka, Mechner's first game, Prince of Persia used rotoscoping for its fluid and realistic animation. For this process, Mechner used as reference for the characters' movements videos of his brother doing acrobatic stunts in white clothes and swashbuckler films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood.\n\nThe game was critically acclaimed and, while not an immediate commercial success, sold many copies as it was ported to a wide range of platforms after the original Apple II release. It is believed to have been the first cinematic platformer and inspired many following games in this subgenre, such as Another World.[4] Its success led to the release of two sequels, The Shadow and the Flame and Prince of Persia 3D, and a reboot of the series starting in 2003 with The Sands of Time.","Publisher":"Broderbund","ReleaseDate":"1990-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TQpbCCUquFY"},"28270":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Palace Software","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"666a8bfb-17e1-4dec-827a-19095fa77ae3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"756d1069-8275-4bfd-ba04-571cf2bff44a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7c33a604-3db4-4877-a7a7-637e55690c2b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c4df3947-1178-408e-8723-5c45ffc85516.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"814e5af0-9abc-4125-a90a-53f6a56c1c5f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"93ecfd18-4c71-4729-bd0a-de82df53af70.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c65e68b8-489b-4832-9b19-d941903508c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b0237b67-f5b7-4713-a012-b482755ad704.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8a36cf19-bc87-4a8f-b40a-6a2e76bc7154.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"03498591-d8ba-4684-833b-d5910334abd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back","Overview":"Cauldron II: The Pumpkin Strikes Back is a computer game developed and published by British developer Palace Software (Palace) as a sequel to their 1985 title Cauldron. The two-dimensional (2D) platform game was released in 1986 for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC home computers. Players control a bouncing pumpkin that is on a quest of vengeance against the \"Witch Queen\". The roles of the two were reversed from the first game, in which the witch defeated a monster pumpkin.\n\nFollowing the success of Cauldron, Palace employee Steve Brown began work on a sequel. To provide fans of the original title with a new experience, a very different gameplay was implemented for the sequel, although several minor features retained connections to the first. Inspired by the bouncing pumpkin character in Cauldron, Brown designed the game around the character's movement. The bouncing mechanic proved problematic for the programmers who were unable to perfect its implementation. Technical limitations also prevented them from implementing certain animations, such as turning pages of a book.\n\nCauldron II was first released on the Commodore 64. It was released in the following years on other systems and as re-releases. The game received praise, mainly for its audio-visuals, in video game magazines. Difficulty in handling the bouncing pumpkin's movement was a common complaint, although reviewers felt the overall package was of good value.","Publisher":"Palace Software","ReleaseYear":1986},"28271":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"SNK Corporation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"bf237678-0e7e-4d8b-87fa-013e693c3bf8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b8e18805-e212-4920-af63-54e92d2811d0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6e184fa5-62ed-477b-aa84-2438ca1492f9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8bad18a0-24b3-4721-952b-decce39bcb25.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be239e34-f878-45d2-9083-3038c71868c4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"90283b9e-a358-4e1a-9792-4d8d9a315d65.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8e79415f-15ae-40ff-9cdc-0af7bc65dd20.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e17f50ba-4401-4a63-b9b5-c6f25359780f.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c509fc5e-d4aa-4282-bda8-bf8b0af9ba26.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ba46f1b4-1bce-42e4-b774-69bd23308d67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"75d44eee-f6d9-4635-ac5a-744e8eaaacab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9887be79-73de-4412-a478-722e1a873df5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ad0bc9ae-a39c-46f7-9c67-78bf096ea48a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"794fb70c-eb53-48c5-93f7-19c34eece24c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"79e5bf67-889d-49da-86c4-8e581841f5b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Ikari Warriors","Overview":"Ikari Warriors is a vertically scrolling, run & gun shoot 'em up arcade game developed by SNK, published in North America and Europe by Tradewest, and released in 1986.[6] Originally titled Ikari (怒?, \"Fury\") in Japan, Ikari Warriors was SNK's first major breakthrough US release and became something of a classic.

While testing the product Morlock inexplicably finds himself in the spaceship within the game. A hyperspace accident clones him thirty times. Each of the clones departs, taking with him a portion of a vital fluid that sustains Morlock's life. Assuming the persona of the brave Captain Blood, the programmer tracks down and disintegrated twenty-five clones, spending 800 years to achieve that goal. However, five clones still remain, hidden somewhere in the depths of the galaxy. Captain Blood must find these clones and destroy them before he loses his own life.\n\nCaptain Blood is an open-ended first-person adventure game. Much of the game consists of traveling to various planets and communicating with the aliens there to gather clues concerning the clones' whereabouts. The player commands a biological ship called Ark, and must launch probes onto planet surfaces, successfully navigating them through the landscape to locate an alien. The Ark can also scan planets and sometimes teleport aliens to different locations.\n\nConversations with the aliens are conducted via the so-called UPCOM interface. Over 150 icons are available to represent different concepts. Since each alien speaks his own language, the player must input various combinations of the icons to be able to understand the alien and communicate with him. Successfully concluding conversations may offer clues or unlock other planets. The protagonist's health deteriorates over the time, which affects the game's interface by making it more difficult to control. These symptoms may be reverted by disintegrating a clone.","Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"28282":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Master Designer Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"9bf9d37c-1b47-4483-aaf3-c2ef49b781d2.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7130c05f-aeac-494f-ae49-d0c20ac1b114.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"010f0dfe-d5c1-4362-8988-79e8d565670d.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"67d96a8a-7289-41c9-84b3-f42763134f54.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f0c7e1f1-3e1d-4f00-a3ef-9e3c53a67e55.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"941e3ef6-44b8-4027-93f6-b9103e4490ac.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"273a3153-6e06-4196-b322-f9eedb4fede1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"963d6722-6bac-4f31-9ca3-5fed5900a9c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"72c33480-6d02-4e0c-a003-2d9a1e4cb43f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b5038bf0-eb04-452a-881a-0aa43831ddbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6847773a-1d34-4306-92d6-f33cadbf4bc7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04497959-d8f2-4716-a1ce-552cbd2b8c68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Defender of the Crown","Overview":"Defender of the Crown puts the player in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen.

However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.\n\nThe game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards. For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.\n\nThe game keeps a score and a high score, and you have a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there is no save feature. In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending. The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseDate":"1986-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dXAWGT0i2Hc"},"28296":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rainbow Arts","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"3a20252c-a3c8-42c4-bc02-b156c89c3b38.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a680d108-91ff-4849-bafb-6b70a180fe76.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4d2b7514-6dc6-4849-934f-60485320599c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"68f3106e-6018-4e12-a956-68eb2f3f6dc9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"52c181d8-ee2d-49ab-8a34-0a198c979ec1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b2bd4a5-1d83-467d-bbf4-00c1a5f0ef40.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e8dc7317-fdb3-4f01-a04a-94345bf9f703.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b4943e80-2c65-49cf-8781-22d8be863e8e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"20481de2-3c74-46fc-ad88-9f1ba3ac05ad.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d50fb3b7-a02d-4644-a491-1f1205c06965.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"adba5e68-d5d2-4b07-85ab-0193c04d58b3.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"e7398d48-4489-441c-9434-4d34d34c7fab.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"357aa4dd-616b-4997-836d-241698058376.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Turrican","Overview":"Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer\/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.\n\nUnlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis.

The player controls a space fighter named the R-9 to defend humanity against a mysterious powerful alien life-form known as the \"Bydo\".\n\n\nThe game is made up of several sequential levels, with a boss enemy at the end of each. The player controls a small spacecraft and must navigate terrain and fight enemies using the various ship weapons.\n\nThe player's spacecraft has, by default, a weak but rapid-firing main gun, which can take out waves of weak fighters; and a more powerful gun called a wave cannon, which requires the player to hold their fire to build up power for the cannon. When released, this fires a concentrated bolt of energy which can do more damage to larger enemies.\n\nDuring the game, the player can obtain an auxiliary device called a Force. This resembles a glowing orange ball. The Force can be attached to the front or back of the player's spacecraft, or detached to fly freely. When attached, the Force provides one of three different powerful weapons, in addition to the main gun and the wave cannon. When detached, these weapons cannot be used, but the Force will instead resort to a secondary set of guns, which can be fired by the player even if the Force is at a distance from the spacecraft.\n\nThe Force has a secondary use as a shield; it is completely indestructible and can block most things fired at it, as well as damage or destroy enemies on contact. It can also be used as a ram, either by attaching it to the spacecraft and running into enemies, or by launching it into enemies.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t2Vo8dbBJig"},"28302":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"b4809c31-5ff9-4f71-975f-beb7b9b6a51c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0989d566-fa60-49d8-95d8-95feeb109cb1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"63d1e526-fe6a-4078-9c11-359cbb4e8711.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6af3ecb0-9e5c-4a53-b9a7-19bd311a1d00.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8b5aa9cf-cd3e-4d6a-bf67-3cd7613277e1.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"68bcef59-251e-47eb-a926-850fa88ede07.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"452a0435-f961-4323-875e-1c2a645b24be.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"97c1be66-d663-426d-bb70-fd95b7069afd.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"e18b1b7e-5067-4875-9182-0b72cbaa0d5f.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"20aaf969-000c-438c-82e3-e6c33bcca013.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f6a2e008-c364-41e4-bc48-6861b7d1e1bd.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Chase H.Q.","Overview":"Chase H.Q.

Kick Off, the first game of the series, was designed by Dino Dini and released by Anco for the Amiga and the Atari ST in 1989. The game was received well by the games industry at the time and won awards.\n\nAfter the release of Kick Off several sequels were released. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of Kick Off). Kick Off 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to Kick Off. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.\n\nIn 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the Kick Off series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with Kick Off and Kick Off 2. In 2001–2003, the KOA collaborated closely with Anco developer Steve Screech in an attempt to relaunch the Kick Off and Player Manager series. Kick Off 2002 was released. Anco started to work on another sequel Kick Off 2004 which reached beta status. The attempt came to a halt when Anco closed in 2003.\n\nBeginning in 2001, annual Kick Off 2 World Cups have been organized by the Kick Off Association (KOA), a fan community devoted to the Kick Off series.","Publisher":"Anco","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"28407":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gang of Five","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c7ab5216-d606-46f7-9d44-244e78861b66.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3e3a47e-4704-46d6-b55d-6fa28ca058ec.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"34bf4942-5488-4ff6-9a2e-816bcaf6e875.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"aa32caa6-4eed-4fdc-80a4-8c115a96ecd6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d470a2de-bb02-4132-b20e-0cf1ec22b205.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d9c5bf21-a8ae-41a8-bf03-1d714cc6d6a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sorcery+","Overview":"The player embodies a magician whose goal is to find and deliver 8 colleagues who were captured by a necromancer.

With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies. There are eight levels to be completed.\n\nThe player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left\/right) should be obtained.\n\nBut the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.\n\nThe game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vEsCKmb5-TU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizball"},"28413":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"CRL Group PLC","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"25f1ec00-366c-40b9-b0db-661f11ede6cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e9b8f73f-7c68-4ed1-8622-edfb62c8cff0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3266f8c8-32f7-4b93-9c86-0ac63c0bbf30.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1b10ff71-a3c0-4bb9-88ab-2740de19bfaf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cb4b27fe-61fe-4f72-b2c0-87f469a0b97f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5deaabcd-7bd8-40f6-b2db-7a41ceba5918.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"da833993-2aaa-4477-9606-4a54cb66a705.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Blade Runner","Overview":"Based on the movie of the same name.

Below this is a text readout giving information on the number and type of replidroids within the vicinity.\n\nIn the main display, your position is represented by a yellow cursor which you can use to navigate the streets with. If you find a replidroid, you can hover over it and press the fire button. Doing so will put you in pursue mode where you automatically land. \n\nAfter you get out, you must hunt down said replidroid in a busy street. There is a scanner in which you can use to keep track of where it is. The replidroid is represented as a green square. The further you progress, the closer you are to them. If the replidroid gets out of range, your skimmer automatically picks you up, and you have to hunt down replidroids elsewhere. Once you catch up with it, you must match your position with theirs and shoot at them in order to get the bounty displayed in the status bar.

One day, he receives a report from a nebula space station, from which he learns that nearby human colonies have been attacked by mysterious aliens known as Xenites. Darrian wastes no time, and sets off to protect the humans and stop the aliens.\n\nXenon is an overhead shooter, in which the player controls a vehicle that is able to transform into a tank or a plane. The transformation can be usually performed by player at any time, to combat particular enemies; however, during some sequences the player is forced to use a specific type of vehicle. During the tank gameplay, the player controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the tank in the direction of choice. \n\nThe game features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where the tank can't shoot them). To combat these, the player needs to transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units. Upgrades can be taken from destroyed enemies.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"28421":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Capcom","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"790ef4ab-9a89-40e1-befa-3e5d64d17c07.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"165462bd-abd4-4ca3-8643-4ec041ec38c9.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"644ca5dd-5590-4574-b3de-e5043d594c9f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3ecf596e-3f0c-4fe1-b52f-a6ba3036612a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8a60fa7f-89b6-4fae-91a6-0c24f0a928fe.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6706d371-21d3-4f46-a050-3a516a974cfa.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dbd8de25-5222-4e36-9c05-e64dc0a972ea.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2e2e01ca-51f7-4836-973b-205648270860.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2ed0ec9d-813f-42aa-9691-259180833b36.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a88be2f6-7f4b-4fe3-b44f-31caf8834cd0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ae669ceb-0c0f-417f-b927-a3ac9c95b048.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c14768c7-ffad-4579-be22-c9c9a2bd2b5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b233a980-0974-4458-8280-2a7ea1c74e7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"1943: The Battle of Midway","Overview":"The game is set in the Pacific theater of World War II, off the coast of the Midway Atoll. The goal is to attack the Japanese Air Fleet that bombed the players' American Aircraft Carrier, pursue all Japanese Air and Sea forces, fly through the 16 levels of play, make their way to the Japanese battleship Yamato and destroy her. 11 Levels consist of an Air-to-Sea battle (with a huge battleship or an aircraft carrier as an End-Level Boss), while 5 levels consist of an all-aerial battle against a squadron of Japanese Bombers and a Mother Bomber that needs to be destroyed.\nAs in 1942, players pilot a P-38. Two buttons are used: one for regular attacks (with several weapons) and one for special actions that executes either a loop like in 1942 or one of three special attacks that damage the plane. Unlike 1942, the player only has one life, with one refillable energy meter. Destroying a complete formation of red enemy planes will result in a power-up, such as a health boost or a temporary special weapons which replaces the default twin gun.","Publisher":"Capcom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HQR1KXb8vDI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/1943:_The_Battle_of_Midway"},"28422":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Software Projects","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"247bce3a-f97b-4570-bea4-bca1fdc97ad5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b7968fcb-08d6-4199-b1fb-3a36a203ff32.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fc234bf1-46da-48d4-bce7-29d6b439db84.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"49374220-e826-4b1d-a795-d645b4975702.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"271d4d62-75d0-450e-baa6-9baf934b81dd.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6a3cb7fe-a562-4533-a177-f568039c497b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7ca8afca-98a2-4e66-a48d-47c68a57008a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d5373a11-e5eb-4425-84b2-51c83ecacdfb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Jet Set Willy","Overview":"Jet Set Willy is a platform video game originally written by Matthew Smith for the ZX Spectrum home computer.

This, in turn, was mounted on top of a square base covering the pivot shaft which allowed players to swivel and elevate the \"gun\". A geared motor inside the casing simulated the recoil felt by the player when they \"fired\" the weapon at in-game targets.[2]\n\nIn order to complete each stage, the player must shoot as many soldiers, tanks, jeeps, choppers, and boats as the game requires. Soldiers can throw hand grenades and knives, and vehicles can shoot missiles and launch rockets. The player's ammunition and grenades are limited, but can be stocked up by shooting barrels and crates or by shooting animals such as chickens and pigs. Occasionally a high-powered machine gun power-up appears, allowing the player's gun to have unlimited ammo and an increased rate of fire for 10 seconds. Completing the Powder Magazine stage fills the player's ammunition and grenade supplies to maximum.\n\nThe hostages do not appear until the Concentration Camp stage. Here, the player must protect them from harm as they run to safety. During the Airport stage, the player must fend off enemy attacks as the hostages run toward the open hatch of an airplane taxiing along a runway. The player is awarded a bonus based on the number of hostages that successfully board the plane.\n\nThe player has a damage bar that increases each time he is hit. The damage bar also increases if a civilian or hostage is shot. Energy boost items randomly appear which, if shot, decrease damage by five points. In addition, the player recovers a large amount of damage after completing the Village stage, and a small amount after completing each of the others. If the damage bar fills completely or the player runs out of ammunition and grenades, the game ends.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m5x1NA5NWHU"},"28425":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Amelie Minuit"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ERE Informatique","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1fca5faa-bcd9-46d1-af5e-005d42370b21.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6cf40c10-7f23-407b-85f6-a7c01a671749.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"328086cc-d8d0-47d1-93d0-e87aa4fceebc.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"42982636-d7ae-46c3-9cf9-a3d43547011d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4ff422a7-a6e4-4e54-81c1-e104eee6bda8.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Amélie Minuit","Overview":"You are Amelie, a blonde hardworker in Paris skyscraper.

It was released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, DOS, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Mega Drive\/Genesis, NES, SNES, and ZX Spectrum.\n\nThe game was much like the original: the player controls a paperboy (or papergirl) who must navigate a bizarre series of obstacles, such as tires rolling down a driveway while a car is being repaired, or strange houses like a haunted house, while trying to deliver the morning paper to various customers on a street (though unlike its predecessor, papers had to be delivered to houses on both sides of the street). Like the original, the game is renowned for its difficulty.\n\nThere are four specific actions that can be taken somewhere in the middle of each stage that reward the player with a front page photo on the newspaper afterwards. Such actions included breaking a window with a paper, where the next day's paper would read \"Mysterious Vandalism Baffles Police\", showing an angry policeman looking at broken windows. Others could be coming across a gas station being robbed and hitting the gunman with a paper behind his back, then having the next day's paper headlined with \"Paperboy {Papergirl} Foils Armed Robbery\" or seeing a runaway baby carriage and stopping it with a paper, and the forthcoming headline being \"Girl {Boy} Saves Breakway Baby\".

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.\n\nThe game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.\n\nThe next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.\n\nAfter escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.\n\nFinally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Platoon_(1987_video_game)"},"28428":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Action Graphics, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"146654bf-8a6a-44bb-9a20-3b08512d402a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c2138a3-4003-4101-8256-c387382b4e30.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7830447e-58e3-4310-8cd4-49ec12cd967b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1af8bb75-f039-45eb-a3ed-3a8d3e06caca.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"de4edc21-3093-49a4-9155-f544f34c9dba.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d142dba5-d61c-4a81-89a0-aca07a312c34.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"35efa9d5-a4e9-44b8-be65-1c9d844892ef.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"877a6988-01b2-4f86-96fe-b3edfc847fa1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"43e4eba0-62d9-4576-b599-73113c277c7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8f0c460d-b22e-4eb1-947e-c05031046d95.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3d230fa9-124e-4e0b-a39b-87fa67a30d4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8de2de01-4b8d-4a7f-9f42-b2788614ce81.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"db23e715-f258-4eac-991e-f21814e574fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b5b16fc8-6312-40a6-b29a-454836ffdd3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"063a10c1-e970-4f4e-9876-7b4a1ed628da.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Winter Games","Overview":"Another in the series of Epyx Olympic sports games.

Alien 8 uses the same image masking technique as Knight Lore, which allows the developers to create composite structures out of stacked images without visual overlay. The technique was copyrighted by Ultimate as the Filmation game engine. As with its spiritual predecessor, the game is rendered isometric projection.[2] The game was critically acclaimed upon release.

Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"28483":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hewson Consultants Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"f4290cd5-3700-46ac-a7ac-d58a145e4dd3.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"919d979f-9c24-4ff0-89c3-aa16feafa1cb.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4e2159c7-8b3a-489a-b4d5-dbb7cee35329.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1dd9662b-f336-4edf-8763-01a5b5648494.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5607be9-a037-439d-a963-55f24f71fb1b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"480f7cf0-838a-4044-a6bc-5b558ee1bb1c.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0a5d594b-c1a8-40c7-9a98-640a26278cfa.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9d5dd5f0-e7a9-475f-a67f-ce7b0afc649b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a21d3654-be2b-451d-84ad-6015b4fa7d03.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Nebulus","Overview":"Nebulus is a video game created by John M.

Kick Off, the first game of the series, was designed by Dino Dini and released by Anco for the Amiga and the Atari ST in 1989. The game was received well by the games industry at the time and won awards.\n\nAfter the release of Kick Off several sequels were released. Player Manager was released in 1990. The game was the first game to combine a management environment (including tactics, league play, transfers, and detailed player attributes) with a football game engine (based on that of Kick Off). Kick Off 2 was released in 1990 as a sequel to Kick Off. The game introduced a number of new features as well as several small alterations.\n\nIn 1992, Dino Dini left Anco and signed a contract for Virgin Games, which released Goal! in 1993. Anco released several further editions of the Kick Off series between 1994 and 1997, but these games had little in common with Kick Off and Kick Off 2.

The main character is Bobo, an inmate who has been sentenced for seventeen years. He must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates. It is possible to play through the events in a sequence or one at a time. Up to six players (alternating, not simultaneously) can play this game. Each event can be played with joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. It is also possible to pick things up and toss them.\n\nThe game includes the following events:\nBobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.\nPeeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.\nIn the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.\nFinally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires.\nIn the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell.

Ultimate's individual style of eschewing straightforward instructions in favor of feature lists and riddles is put to good use here, with the story detailed in a rhyming poem of sorts.","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"28569":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"b3d32bad-4be0-4a49-bdab-a44f653e5c25.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"264e6f29-ef22-4d0c-8f2e-2fdb2a6715f8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3a501d1c-754a-4e73-be8c-ff4b3ada06ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5e5f3b4b-14d8-428e-83e2-edadcd100f92.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e3843390-6305-43a5-bf8d-cdbcb7ff1e02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dd7b2057-3967-41c3-bfc5-41e23790427a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tomahawk","Overview":"Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration turned their attention to helicopter flight in this recreation of the AH-64 Apache.

By 1992 there were also DOS, Atari ST and Amstrad CPC versions available. It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks.\n\nThe game was the first Dizzy game not to be developed entirely by Dizzy's creators, the Oliver Twins. Instead, whilst they were focusing on other projects, Magicland Dizzy was designed by Neal Vincent and coded by external developer Big Red Software. The Oliver Twins retained design-approval oversight.\n\nThe game is sometimes alternatively known by its development title, Dizzy 4, with the Roman numeral IV visible at the top of the game screen, behind the player's score. A prequel, Into Magicland, was released to promote the game and featured a new character that was never seen in any of the series games again. The game was widely acclaimed by critics across the platforms with scores typically in the 80-95% region. Criticism was leveled at its similarity to previous games in the series and the awkward inventory system. By November 1991 it was noted that the Dizzy games had sold more than half a million units across all platforms.","Publisher":"Codemasters"},"28639":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"dc24fd4f-ad85-489b-9802-32abe30dcd96.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"74afd39b-8b5a-4793-bd1a-693ca4653753.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"74f499f0-5099-4a52-b7be-1fdfdd3b73f1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ec494a3a-c8fb-41a4-a6df-94f14d8e85c3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0c1fd609-c5ce-4fa1-a694-68268065515a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f063b359-6859-4d33-8fa3-7bd526b9c453.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7fc7ffa7-0cef-4294-8d6b-d6e84703030b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94a21d9b-8b9b-4dfe-8260-6699a7d89399.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0573d8be-d935-410c-90f4-dac243594038.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ae98b28a-f767-40a7-b4d8-2bc7ab2bcc1d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2be26291-a232-4445-ad07-bc1c55e44620.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4e2a82ab-42e2-49b4-b395-6d4f7b545d8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9e2fd7aa-b0d8-4696-be8e-83f86aa5f75e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Kwik Snax","Overview":"Dizzy must rescue four of his 'Yolkfolk' (groan) chums in this game, from Cuckoo Land, Ice Land, Cloud Land and Zak's Castle.

The game can be played against a CPU-controlled opponent or a second player. Player 1 takes control of Nick, a brown-haired recruit in an orange shirt, while Player 2 is Joe, a blond-haired recruit in a blue shirt. The game system is similar to Konami's Track & Field series.\n\nThe game is composed of seven training events whom the player must complete. Upon a near-success failure to complete an event(failing too severely results in game over), the player must do a set number of chin ups as punishment(this chance is given only once) in order to continue into the succeeding events, or it's game over. The events are as followed:\n\nObstacle Course – Set in a side-scrolling segment, the player must reach the end of the stage under the allotted time before his opponent while climbing walls and clearing bars. Losing to the CPU or to one another does not mean Game Over as long as the player(s) cross(es) the finish line within the allotted time.\nShooting Range No. 1 – The player must shoot as many targets as possible under the allotted time. If played against a second player, then the one who shoots the most targets win.\nIron Man Race – Similar to the obstacle course, but set in a top view angle. The player must reach the goal while avoiding mines and other obstacles. Eventually the player must cross a lake by either swimming or rowing a boat. Losing to the CPU or to one another does not mean Game Over so long as the player(s) cross(es) the finish line within the allotted time.\nShooting Range No. 2 – Same as the first one, but now with moving targets.\nArm Wrestling – The two recruits are pitted against each other in a match of strength and stamina. More like a bonus stage than an actual course. Player doesn't get penalized for losing.\nShooting Range No. 3 – The third and final shooting range stage features penalty targets.\nFighting – The player faces against his instructor in hand-to-hand combat in the final event. There is no make-up punishment in this event. If a player loses this event, it is game over no matter what. If played with a second player, then the two players must fight each other. Only the victor is allowed to graduate.\nAfter all seven events are cleared, the player graduates from basic training only to be sent on a mission(the 8th and the final stage) to rescue the U.S. President from armed terrorists. The final stage consist of a single side-scrolling level where the player must fight off terrorists using all the skills acquired during the course of training. This stage can only be played by one player. Without a continue feature, without spare stocks of lives, and the player dies with one hit(minus the part that pits you in a hand-to-hand combat against the terrorist leader) from anything, the final stage is extremely difficult to clear.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"28715":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pierre Giroud","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5a10ba4d-87db-4727-9677-6fe64ea7c057.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8bc623d8-26f4-49b2-a11f-5817712ee2bd.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"278e00ce-6df5-41c1-ab3d-da204134552f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d13c4e6b-0e3c-4001-8736-ede3f662e429.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"688947c8-0186-4294-b41b-e4e1ab825b29.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"04b789de-7fdb-4ea8-80e0-2ae09ec85a19.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9ba3dbf9-ebfb-42f8-9463-68d0789f7647.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"72fbf6bc-cd5a-4741-846d-729947d73a45.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"1001 B.C.: A Mediterranean Odyssey","Overview":"Découvrez un monde fabuleux : celui des poèmes d’Homère.

Up to eight players could take part in open bowling or a tournament. There was a choice of 3 different difficulty levels—Kids (in which the ball always went straight), Amateur, and Professional.\n\nThe scorecard for the current player was displayed above the lane. The player could move left or right on the lane before starting the run-up by holding fire. A target cursor could also be moved, by pushing up and then moving it left or right (pressing down returned control to moving the onscreen player's position). Once the fire button was held, a power meter similar to Leaderboard's was employed. The speed of the shot was determined by how long the button was held down. A small zone at the top determined if the player made an error, exaggerating any spin. When the meter started to descend on the right, it was stopped in the hook zone to determine how much hook\/spin was applied - from straight at the top of the zone, to full hook at the bottom. Play was completed after the usual ten frames and any bonus balls. The animation used a similar sprite system to Leaderboard, and the falling pin physics were handled well.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N-MrVJi32Vk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/10th_Frame"},"28790":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alain Savetier","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"a4af7f62-de6b-4691-b679-592bc4c109a5.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"47bbb191-66d5-46d4-982f-68c89eb425a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"af8b2fe5-aef0-48d9-9a8d-33a05f7e51d9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"84ecea7b-79ee-4e2b-8b61-a842362cc290.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bc6de6ff-f5df-4844-8e48-835e33ddc8b9.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b44adebb-a93d-4628-93a9-239f7f01a768.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"290bbf1f-ed1f-4a74-9458-713abd908ebb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"369657ac-32d2-46f4-a8dc-30c7430ef29e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":1815,"Overview":"1815 is a strategic war game.

The ball is aimed by positioning a cross-hair cursor in the desired direction and clicking the mouse button.\n\nThe game has in-game help text that opens in a new window, sound effects, a boss key, and the computer opponent has three skill levels.

At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.\n\nAs you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance. Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.

The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs. An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.\n\nUltimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.","Publisher":"Rainbird","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SWjTW7P-qdM"},"29924":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mike Singleton","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"ce89fc68-be56-4127-937e-b586a54f7de4.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"728f5d99-0453-41e7-a506-2b8f165498bc.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7efcb55-b1bb-45e2-8247-ab08417df78a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d9679e6f-c2c3-4f1f-9ef7-117124c27733.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"da5b3958-1851-43f5-9cf7-99855bfb5164.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fa4318bb-1bef-49fb-9502-845d98007871.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3ad11125-e624-4089-8082-852ca2fc33e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b38db7e6-2fe8-4183-b90d-c93e82659c37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Lords of Midnight","Overview":"The Lords of Midnight is an award winning adventure video game, written by Mike Singleton, and released in 1984 for the ZX Spectrum.

Usually there is a puzzle associated with these rooms that must be solved in order to access them.","Publisher":"Mastertronic Added Dimension","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"30157":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ed5f3d2b-542c-4893-8ac1-29959cf6baf7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d7998cd0-3b3a-427e-b2ec-2298a2ab1776.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fe2db2cd-b098-4c9b-a369-570390f9a284.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e7900f1e-b0bd-4973-9b97-a52066c033c3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b00365e5-1287-4ca5-bab6-66aca6058f23.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"576bd670-de5b-489a-8420-94f3cfe912a7.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"73709672-aa16-4d5a-b535-a81fc462593a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"87e1f9b9-53d0-4af3-80ce-1b9c8d8e2216.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"80bb0614-4477-4bdb-9a08-9aa61f891cbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Starquake","Overview":"As BLOB, the Bio-Logically Operated Being, you are sent into an unstable planet and charged with the task of preventing it from exploding.

The main character is a rebellious black slave working on a sugar plantation that tries to incite a revolt among the slave population to gain freedom and to give comeuppance to each of their old masters.\n\nAt the start of the game there is four characters to choose, each with different statistics and abilities like \"constitution\" and \"lock-picking\". The main game screen is a map of the plantation, where you guide a small icon of the character while trying to avoid the guard dogs. If the dogs find you, they either bark and alert the owners or attack you. When they do, the screen switches to a first-person screen where you have to avoid being bitten and killed by the animal.\n\nOn the top of the screen there are four buttons, each with a unique function:\nPath-finding lets you click on the map with a cursor and see a description of each hut and house.\nMovement allows you to move your character. Left-clicking shows a first-person view of your surroundings. This screen can vary depending of the place where you are in the map. Most of the time is the recruitment screen, where you click on your brother slaves to amass a army. Their response is a random \"yes\" or \"no\". If you click while on a sugar field, you get the option of climbing the huts, picking the storage hut lock, or setting fire to the premises. If you click while on the housings of the owner or one of his henchmen, you get the option of either confronting the person, or running away. If you decide to confront him, the screen switches to a side-view similar to fighting games like Street Fighter, with two energy bars at the bottom, where you have to fight one of the owner's men. If you win, you have the choice of killing the person or holding him captive.\nReview is the game statistics screen, where you can see your progress in the game.\nAdvice only starts working once you get the support of either the shaman or the medicine man. They can heal any wound sustained by dog attacks and fights.\nThe game accepts mouse, keyboard and joystick controls, and plays drum music and other sounds."},"30375":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Crafton & Xunk","Region":"France"},{"Name":"Crafton & Xunk: L'Ange de Cristal","Region":"France"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ERE Informatique","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"4501479e-6d6e-46de-935f-f875e5ea793b.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"68e905a8-9fb0-4a04-ae32-7a1028c78cd7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"455ae297-9205-4836-9e9a-632a5e29d95d.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b6cc15e-0885-4115-b62f-fd74dc9bdacb.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a86cad73-f911-45f0-bc31-293623154b66.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e3826153-e5b3-4d60-a198-f7eaef5a7039.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"55e2c035-f88a-4bf7-a4d2-815c402018c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"00ccee61-9145-41d3-9501-6eeb6d2a2633.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7038874c-b55f-438f-895f-77cd753c10bd.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"da3590c4-b8ad-42df-938b-be8dc1633148.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9569ae68-cfc1-4ebf-8007-0689eba5b5fd.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Get Dexter","Overview":"Crafton the android wants a life of freedom, away from the science experiments he is usually subjected to.

This means the current salt price is the most important part when planning shipments (besides the weather). Of course the player also has to purchase and maintain other things, e.g. a trading station, ships and cannons. Alternatively the player can also participate in smuggling.\n\nWhen using the game alone, the player competes against an AI opponent. He sometimes attacks the player's trading stations which results in a fight scene in which the player has to place his cannons so they destroy the attacking ships during the automatic attack phase. There are also other similar sequences and random occurrences like weddings or disasters that may force the player to react. The game is completely menu driven and offers multiplayer for up to six people.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"30394":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"New Frontier","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"b13562a7-2c6c-4b68-9d82-14cad112cdc9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0ba4c33d-2b17-4a8a-ad0a-fd4f52842b69.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"66edd2fa-365e-41a3-b951-931174dabcab.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1b7c6711-3c65-4da5-963d-ee448d9386e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bba10992-ac5e-422f-93e4-5b50bf242dec.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b1027cda-126c-4a54-ad0e-f175f130f143.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3fb82349-a456-4792-b6c7-063733f61a7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hostages","Overview":"Terrorists have overrun an embassy and hold the people inside as hostages.

The game was written by Dave Lebling and inspired by the horror fiction writings of H. P. Lovecraft (including his Cthulhu Mythos). Like most of Infocom's games, it was released for several platforms simultaneously thanks to the Z-machine.\n\nThe original release included versions for DOS, the Apple II, Atari ST, Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64. Later, it was ported to the Amiga with the addition of sound effects, making it the first title with that feature. The effects would play at appropriate times in the game in an effort to intensify the horror atmosphere. This marked one of the few major additions to the Z-machine with the exception of graphics; traditionally, Infocom had eschewed such changes in favor of expanding the parser capacity and overall size of game files. It was Infocom's 26th game; Infocom rated it as \"Standard\" in terms of difficulty.

Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.\n\nThe four predefined characters are:\nSyrela: a human female minstrel,\nPodus: a male dwarf thief,\nGelth: a male elf wizard, and\nTorlin: a male mi-orc ranger\nEach character has values for the following attributes, constitution, strength, knowledge, wisdom, dexterity, and appearance. When creating your own characters there is a maximum of 80 points can be assigned to these attributes with none having more than 20 points or less than 5.\n\nCharacter control is unusual and consists of abbreviated commands. The whole party moves as a single unit so to move North, South, East or West the player just has to type N, s, E, or W. When the party comes on an enemy the commands take the form\ncharacter: each character in the party is referred to by a number in the range 1 - 4\ncommand: only the first two characters need to be typed\ntarget: objects and enemies are referred to by letter\nSo when a monster is encountered typing 3 will select Gelth, typing AT will command Gelth to ATtack, and typing A will instruct Gelth to attack the first target.

The player loses the game if either they run out of money or all of their rock stars die.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30488":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"a874c3e8-4a99-434c-b590-a47dbdd67942.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"37721498-a930-4bcd-8f2a-511541374228.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"49448bda-4e32-46de-b0d3-7cd76364e870.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"22e779f7-a5de-452e-a266-574ad7a62dfe.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2d3392b6-e624-4be8-8548-adf33b5667d8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"663cd959-9912-41ee-942a-ea0a37af3c6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"327e03a6-8d2b-46e1-afa5-5fae98b1e2d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Southern Belle","Overview":"Southern Belle is a train simulation video game published by Hewson Consultants in 1985.

The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings. \n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical\/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"30751":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"4-Mation","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8e360429-3fcb-49b1-8d62-68854fa8f4ad.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b285e7cb-6811-47ee-b733-da76e2fa361f.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9986f267-70dd-4caf-bd94-067124882ac1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2616238b-8646-424d-8d8f-1c5773c9093d.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1cef3c24-3648-4494-9226-261b03590723.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a0d680e6-c446-4871-b9b2-f8a521a57b7c.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"97d15033-bd88-4df4-9f95-665f7b507319.png","Region":"Australia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Granny's Garden","Overview":"The Amstrad release of this game was by Angle Park Computing Centre, Australia.\n\nAn indelible memory for the entire '80s cohort of UK schoolchildren, this educational game, originally released in 1983 on the BBC Micro, solicits textual input from the player regarding the correct approach and technique for rescuing three pairs of royal children from a wicked witch.

The gameplay takes place in a 3D isometric universe, which programmer Jon Ritman and artist Bernie Drummond would further develop for 1987's Head over Heels, and is notable for implementing an early example of a save game system that allows players to restart from an intermediate point in the game on the loss of all lives rather than returning all the way to the start (in this case the point at which Batman collects a \"Batstone\").","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Batman_(1986_video_game)"},"93915":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Academy - Tau Ceti II"},{"Name":"Space School Simulator: The Academy"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pete Cooke","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"884a58b0-0a75-470b-803c-4d420c54708c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1bebefa0-9f40-4a59-83a3-d0b6f1582dd2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f4627b01-44c7-4d6b-89d6-43e80cd399a8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"942050b0-6e79-4032-853f-5b92485e1c8f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e23f9705-60df-4097-9f4e-babcbae0e204.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1e61350f-f749-43f5-b231-c5aea9cc3c8a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4d1c4e80-b924-4555-ab6e-4b7b16aa1dbf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d7f43c54-6ecf-4e56-a660-ec02fa053c58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Academy: Tau Ceti II","Overview":"Pete Cooke's follow-up to the previous space shooter-explorer takes things away from the Tau Ceti setting.

Extra tickets are awarded at 5,000, 15,000, 25,000, 35,000 etc. points. Medals are awarded for good performance in the parks, with cash prizes and bonus points.\nAfter visiting each park a status sheet is displayed indicating medals awarded. High score and remaining credits also. When in the vicinity of a shop an icon to the right of the screen flashes alternately with the price. These icons represent helmets, shoes, skateboard and pads. The level of equipment is indicated alongside the appropriate icon. Approaching the counter at the correct place either results in a \"SALE\" or \"NO SALE\" message.\nBonus points are awarded for remaining cash at the end of the game.\nIf the player does not enter a park within the time limit displayed on the bar timer, he is pursued by killer bees. These become more dangerous if the player does not enter a park quickly, transforming into various objects. Extra points may be gained by passing over certain hidden locations. \nDollar bills on the road may be collected. The player should avoid contact with other characters appearing on the screen.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YSOI0XtT4QU"},"124745":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Animagic S.A.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"ad8323f7-4b57-4806-933d-97bbede849d5.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information"},{"FileName":"aaedaab5-9f4e-49e5-bab3-43eb61f61f5d.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"28943756-6b6c-48b5-88ae-2dae51c1c984.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ac3186a6-0fc4-4b52-b8b9-fc0c1b62e3cd.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"698f239d-0b18-4d7a-a71d-7b0335cb3ec5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"63e4cdac-dd44-4dd2-9c0f-e5aa4e95a9c6.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cfcac4df-832c-49dc-bf51-aa973bc53b92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f4910841-4ffc-489e-a012-4637dc7f0dd4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AAARGH!","Overview":"What's that coming over the hill, is it a monster?

Level two is the Risk course. This one will have you planting dynamite and throwing grenades.\n\nLevel three has the player going hand-to-hand in the Combat course. The fourth level combines the previous three levels into one, and finally, the fifth level is a custom \"Cobra\" course that throws random elements from all the courses at the player.\n\nTo give the game replay value, there is a course construction set so that you can make your own levels.

After a while, the enemy, which can range from easy prey such as cargo ships to hard as nails battleships, will become within range and you will be able to engage. After several successful engagements the Altmark supply ship will appear to replenish your fuel and ammo and carry out small repairs on your ship.\n\nDepending on the player's skill, several endings are available. The high brass are willing to let you retire with full honors if you sank enough enemy ships for them, but the allied side will do anything they can to sink your ship.

It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).\n\nADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.\n\nThere's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.\n\nYou navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.","Publisher":"Futura","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1WapPK2hFiI"},"124753":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"7af8ee57-26cc-4e9c-aeaf-13b90f5e2cb4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"87dbc8bc-456e-4be0-8f98-c59c46cdf919.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a64bf1b5-215a-4a6f-b2c1-da05ff2ba3a3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"eac98c80-d8e4-4bb8-8faa-59d889043067.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8dff716-d73a-4449-bfea-a29d65211ce1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fb1a0919-708e-4216-b000-33274f44df4e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a1895759-80cf-4f7d-b5be-fd727213baad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a4ac026b-0618-46d4-be79-54dce0ce7019.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":3,"Name":"Advanced Pinball Simulator","Overview":"Part of Codemasters' original budget-price range, this pinball game aimed to put fast & furious action first.\n\nThe table design features extra flippers on both sides, which are at the bases of sections of features.

To unlock these codes, Basildon must piece together several jokes, which are found in various rooms inside a television studio. Once Basildon has collected a joke, they must be entered in the main computer.\n\nCollecting the jokes is not an easy task for Basildon. For one thing, to use certain objects, some other object must be collected first. For another, moving TV cameras roam around in some rooms, and if Basildon comes into contact with any of these, he returns to the computer room and ten minutes of his time is lost. \n\nHowever, to deal with the cameras, Basildon is equipped with ten Cooperblasters which can be used to summon Cooperman. Once Cooperman has been summoned, the player is free to navigate him toward the camera, and once Cooperman comes into contact with the camera, it is destroyed. If the player leaves and re-enters the room, the cameras return and the player has to summon Cooperman again, wasting precious Cooperblaster ammo. Cooperman can only be summoned ten times, and the player is unable to collect more ammo, so they need to use Cooperman wisely.\n\nOne summon out of ten introduces the player to another character known as Blunderwoman, who does far more damage than Cooperman because whereas Cooperman just flies from one side of the screen to the other in a straight line unless the player interferes, Blunderwoman flies diagonally across the screen and back again without the player's involvement, killing any cameras that she does not kill the first time.\n\nThe game ends when the five hours are over.","Publisher":"Probe Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eRy022YHhDY"},"124756":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Crom Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"d52db0e8-e837-4fa7-aa2d-ae3d80f33afa.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8e60c14-d7ec-4678-8300-272a63275e01.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cf2a4ae9-9309-4caf-bd12-c582ed351002.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ddd613a-a07e-4aad-a334-0b03854cfa0c.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d47e692c-9d64-42ba-97ce-83ece5376047.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5e146562-c270-4fa8-a45b-4390e12f900a.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1d83d732-f46d-457b-8879-318bf0d8a57e.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"e2ca4b9c-b10c-4ba3-8627-c74115864235.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"81bbbe0e-01dd-4579-976a-c47c19dbf396.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"African Trail Simulator","Overview":"Take to the desert on your off-road bike as you negotiate all the stages of the African trail.\n\nBefore you start each stage, you must select three items of equipment to take with you.

All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.","Publisher":"MicroProse","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"124762":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Keith Purkiss","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"07dd4b92-e324-494f-8ca7-7e7d6f26b137.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8c25ecab-55e9-4ad7-8192-2d0eeadd3df9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"438ca672-cd07-426f-8809-3bac027846e9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aef4c290-3f14-4529-83da-3c4b057f876d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"783ae2e4-18de-42a1-9b60-95eb96b7dbdf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2e8e08ff-334d-4802-a33b-85f78abead78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dfc5bc8d-7c65-48f9-90a8-147f05707fb8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"76c0f409-8b95-4e5d-9454-d306ad2ffdb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"39f8d6bc-02cf-49b6-a43e-5fceded691ef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2d6f5787-3a61-4cb4-a974-e9282321994a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aladdin's Cave","Overview":"Aladdin's Cave is an arcade maze game published by Artic Computing.

The action starts after the chestburster scene which unleashes an alien organism into their enclosed spaceship. The remaining crew members must attempt to destroy it while the traitorous android tries to protect the alien. \n\nThere are 3 decks to search with 35 different rooms which are connected by ducts which the alien can use to sneak up on people. You can herd the alien into an airlock to blast it out into space, or set the auto-destruct on the ship and flee in the shuttle with all remaining live crew members plus Jones the cat who must be found and put in a box.\n\nThe screen shows you a plan of the deck you are on, and the ducts in the immediate area. There are ‘trackers’ and sensors which can be used to pinpoint movement in other areas. In ordering each crew member, you are given possible movements or other actions such as picking up weapons, entering the ducts or catching the cat. In certain situations, special options will appear such as starting the self-destruct system when in the command centre. The responses to orders are also affected by the personality of the crew member, and how much they have had to suffer. \n\nThe screen also displays reports on the condition of the crew member you’ve selected, whether there is any damage to the room you’re in and whether the duct grills are open (meaning the Alien has been through there). You also get the occasional message from the ship's computer ‘Mother’ like when a crew member dies. Sound effects create suspense. At times you hear the alien move around or doors and grills being opened as well as the blip from the tracker.","Publisher":"Amsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"124766":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Romik","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"cfc29e2f-162f-466c-870a-0ed5f0faa05a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d9110197-eeff-4bd2-97d9-dc78814de47f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2375804e-a39b-4943-99fd-6cdde54815a0.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b62f2a4c-5140-4bac-b264-be22ca428e66.png","Region":"France","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8d96fed5-9cd1-4088-9628-f10e4e934621.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4237c819-5614-4f84-9f6b-c374fa67ca6f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"81032be0-b3be-48d9-a948-bf0b38aee460.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"82030098-fd59-4e3b-8494-64fab567ba25.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alien Break-In","Overview":"An early mix of Galaxian and Space Invaders.

The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.\n\nWhen you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.\n\nWhen you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.\n\nAt the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. \n\nYou can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"124769":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Julian Alvarez","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ba618ac2-c819-45ae-8962-fb088b213c1f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3e926b6f-3cf6-4cf6-b4f7-58425c4008c2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4f3e5341-a415-45a0-9a6e-c4ce8e40c99f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"acabb9c0-bdb7-4226-9056-7055a94ce0a5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"717f81ac-4cb4-4773-8b50-d06c6fd73d65.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"78468ecd-aacc-4536-b7d8-3faf5b3b401f.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c69ba409-f5f1-4adf-a503-2a81f51dc8e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"07e3904e-00e3-4d0a-a9b3-698ac7aee43d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alive","Overview":"Alive is an adventure game on Amstrad CPC.

Channel nine is used to allow the player to select between competition and practice modes.\n\nAt the end of each game the scores are displayed. After the last game has been played the game displays the medal table, there can be a long wait while the game reads to the end of the tape to find this program. When the selected game(s) have been played the medal table is displayed and the gaming session is over. If further game-play is desired, e.g. for a rematch, then the whole game must be reloaded and the player selection process has to be repeated.\n\nThe eight games are;\nThe Sack Race\nThis race takes place in Mexico. The objective is to be the first across the finish line. Speed is achieved by pressing left \/ right alternately while using the up \/ down keys to steer around open man-hole covers which are the obstacles in this event. Players can play against each other or the computer. \nThe Pile Of Plates\nThis race takes place in Pisa, Italy. Each player takes it in turn to compete. before starting the up \/ down keys are used to set the number of plates to be carried. Once set the same keys are used to determine the speed at which the character moves, too fast and plates will fall. A countdown timer starting at 100 is used to ensure that the race is completed in a reasonable time. When the characters are moving the left \/ right keys can be used to move the characters arms to counteract the wobble. Points are scored for speed of completion, number of plates carried and points are lost for plates dropped, thus a player who carries eight plates across successfully will score more points than a player who started with 30 and finished with 14. \nBoot Throwing\nThis event takes place in Italy by the Colosseum. Each player has three turns to see who can throw the boot the furthest. There is a choice of a throwing the boot empty, which means it's lighter so the player has longer to build up speed, or a boot full of water, which is heavier but takes more effort. The player uses the left \/ right action keys to make the character swing the boot around in a circle. A power indicator shows how much speed has built up, swing for too long however and your character will get tired and lose that turn. At an appropriate point in the swing the player presses 'FIRE'. When all players have thrown the furthest throw wins. \nRiver Jump\nEach player has three attempts to pole-jump the river. The character starts with their pole up in the air. When the 'FIRE' key is pressed the character automatically starts to run, the player has no control over the speed. However, the pole is heavy and will tend to droop, if it hits the ground while the character is still running then they will fall over. To be successful the character must approach the river with the pole in a (near) horizontal position, if this achieved the character will automatically dip their pole into the river and the player must hit 'FIRE' again to make them release their grip on the pole and, hopefully, land on the other side.\nPole Climbing\nThis takes place in a castle courtyard and it is a two player game. Players can play each other or they can play against the computer. It is a time limited game where the object is to climb to the top of the pole, collect a bottler of champagne, and safely slide back down inside 5 minutes. The player makes their character climb by repeatedly pressing a specific sequence of up \/ fire \/ down. For every failed sequence the character slides down the pole, too many slides and the character will fall off., Descending too quickly with the champagne will cause the player to drop the bottle and fail.\nRun Up The Wall\nThis game takes place in Venice. Players take it in turns to have three runs at the wall. As they reach the wall they must jump, this causes the character to run up the wall. A further action key is required to place the hat on the wall and, if all keys are pressed done correctly, the character's hat will stick to the wall and the highest hat wins. The player does not, however, start with a hat. In their run up to the wall they must time their approach so that they are beneath a passing parrot who drops one hat per run. A jump without a hat does not score.\nPillow Fight\nThis game is set in Venice, Italy. It is a two player game which starts with the players pairing off against each other or against the computer. The two characters are on board a gondola and must bash each other with pillows until time expires or one falls in the water. There are specific key combinations for right \/ left \/ overhead strikes and blocks. Points are scored for successful strikes. The player who falls into the water loses. Each player fights only once, the player with the highest number of points wins\nPogo Stick\nThis game is set in Greece among the ruins of a ancient temple. It is a timed event. each player takes turns to pogo around the ruins popping balloons. Points are scored for each balloon burst and the course must be completed in nine minutes, fifty-nine seconds.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"124773":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paragon Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"4fd3d19b-4e3c-4e3e-b534-92c3c25f8eec.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8ba48807-b8d9-4209-8606-0a7ee97c7a85.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3d717a97-d423-4a83-a02b-2994996b3831.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"095fc040-3a9d-417b-bdbc-667bb4d5d5d6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"79607ab2-3535-423c-8bb0-6b68679dc0a0.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b2a53241-05c5-4dc4-93bb-988ee77851ea.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8d0faf27-590f-4095-abb8-6878ad12a0ab.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Amazing Spider-Man and Captain America in Dr. Doom's Revenge!","Overview":"Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel superhero is not enough to stop him.

Now the troop has to explore the planet and find out more about what happened.\n\nThe party has six members (chosen from twelve pre-defined characters) with different statistics and abilities, e.g. fighting, cooking, PSI (the science-fiction variant of magic) or translating (needed to communicate with non-hostile species).

Killing enemies reward experience points which in turn improve the abilities.\n\nEach character has to eat and sleep. While too much hunger results in death, a sleeping character is in a kind of trance: he still walks around, but can't take any actions or fight. Besides sleeping, there is also medicine available to keep the spirits up: just like other parts of equipment, it can be bought in hidden shops with gold found at slain enemies.

Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day\/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\nArchon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"124792":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Archon II - Adept"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Free Fall Associates","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f672cd12-d5e9-42bb-89a2-ca1a7ac2a11c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"480ef831-ebd6-4a53-92e2-acf8eddb5213.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aac6736a-c735-40d4-81f3-3d2a0c5df993.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2fb133b8-fa76-43da-835f-8e9b76a35f04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"185ba942-7257-47b2-8e97-0aa77ad4bb67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Archon II: Adept","Overview":"The sequel to Archon, Archon II: Adept features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay.\n\nEach side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him\/her with summoned Elementals or Demons.

The task at hand is to break through the enemy blockade and pick up troops from a sabotage mission behind enemy lines. \n\nThe game is split into three stages. The game starts with the player being aboard a warship that is slowly approaching land. This section works similarly to the battle station sequence of Beach-Head. The player takes control of the ship's cannon from a first person perspective and has to shot down the enemy ships as they appear while at the same time avoiding their fire. At any time the player can take off with his helicopter and move on to the next stage which is a shoot 'em up game in the style of 1942. However the helicopter has a limited amount of fuel and therefore the player can't launch it too early, as it won't be enough to reach the shore. The number of waves of enemy planes in this section depends on how many ships the player has destroyed in the naval stage. Upon reaching the island the third stage is launched which plays like River Raid.

It gathered a cult following from the elite programmers who knew how to connect to the data bank where it was located, and like all cults, it had its first \"martyrs\"; several important programmers were fired after becoming \"addicted\" to it, found playing it late at night while understood to be working overtime instead.\n\nIn the United States it was the base that inspired Scott Adams to begin with his famous adventures. In Great Britain, Peter Austin, founder of Level 9, the most prestigious English adventure game company, confessed to be impelled by it from his beginnings as a game designer (one of his first adventures was a version of the Original Adventure). In Spain, there was a similar story, since the first Spanish company dedicated exclusively to text adventures (Aventuras AD), made its reputation based on a game curiously called \"La Aventura Original\" (yes, based on the legendary one), the fruit of 8 months of investigation and work.\n\nThis version, aside from being in Spanish, has with several points worth mentioning, such as having more than 100 detailed locations with graphical illustrations; a special routine of exit descriptions (indispensable for guiding the adventurer through this complex world); and the possibility of using accents, \"ñ\"'s and opening interrogation and exclamation signs. As well, every object of your inventory is described in text and graphic form.

It was first developed for the Atari ST, and was ported to the Amiga, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, MSX, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. The Amiga port was released in 1987; the others were released in 1988. Like most early Psygnosis titles, the cover artwork (part of \"Red Dragon\" figure\/landscape) was by the popular fantasy artist, Roger Dean.\n\nThe game spawned a 1991 sequel, Barbarian II, released alongside Leander, and Ork, other platform-based action-adventures from Psygnosis.\n\nThe game opens with a striking—for the era—animation of a muscle-bound barbarian cutting a chain with a sword. On the Amiga and Atari ST versions, the animation is accompanied by a loud, digital sound effect.\n\nIn the game, the player is Hegor, a barbarian who must traverse several dungeons and underground habitats to defeat his brother, the evil sorcerer Necron. He has a sword and bow in his arsenal of weapons. Running and jumping, as with many platform games, comprises a large part of the gameplay of this title.\n\nThe game used a unique control system to make up for lack of more than one joystick button on many systems. The player would first press the one button after which a \"menu\" of actions would appear along the bottom of the screen.

Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!\n\nThe premise, the map with the \"stages\", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when \"boss\" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"125655":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciel SA","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d6920eae-09c1-4b3c-a966-c8eb6f379d2a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d8d65ca-c865-46c6-8428-7ce7e64cb6fe.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c1c90a10-9c56-457b-8ac0-7fa1e3e13827.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b1343604-765c-47d6-a32d-f0f9feb2729e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"3821b304-60ae-4bb9-b899-b913e617956e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a4e1b265-fa58-4510-a47d-3f980832b5c1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bumpy's Arcade Fantasy","Overview":"Mixture of action and puzzle elements.

Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.\n\nYou are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.\n\nGameplay in Dark Side has more action than its predecessor, Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle, change the length of your steps, make quick U-turns, and look up or down. The jetpack uses energy at a fast rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid the security turrets called Plexors, which shoot lasers and weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.","Publisher":"Incentive","ReleaseYear":1988},"126341":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Icon Design","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"6ebcac98-706f-42d3-bc85-4dd6d98e4315.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"3148498d-bb4a-4740-914d-a35e7e6b0d9d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b03eff9a-8d9f-40e9-bcf3-6334eefa7d0a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1b7627d7-7f5e-4624-82d0-d577fec27429.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c343ba43-572f-40de-a5e1-302c07b783e7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"047e58f5-ab92-49f3-8f83-298f300eb667.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2a2e634e-165f-4790-bc56-0ee6860bd19e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8821ee79-4365-4688-81a6-c0b795388f61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ninja","Overview":"This is an side-scrolling beat-'em-up game consisting of a succession of fights, in which you (surprisingly) play a ninja whose job is to go through the playfield and kill everyone in his path.

The player controls six characters from a remote terminal, guiding them through a 255-room complex in search of the Alien Queen. Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.\n\nThe player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).\n\nAliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same). If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will \"capture\" that character (indicated by a yellow status light). The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them. If not, the captured character will be lost.\n\nAmmunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"127352":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Angleball"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ian Heath","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"93df7bd7-ee59-4cdf-a171-0803db68d962.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"046d27b8-dd0b-4996-818e-164b56273bae.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"dcbd40b8-da31-4d3e-bb12-821dc0a32192.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b90bc21b-a142-4672-b38f-b9aa47dc69ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4cfb2ece-f48f-4843-89aa-e4308ea97af3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Angle Ball","Overview":"Angleball is a variation on Pool, using a hexagonal table with 6 pockets and 6 sides.

Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike.

It was also ported to the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum later that year. It is the eighth instalment to the Strategic Wargames series. The game is set during a fictional scenario in which the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact engage in a conventional war throughout Europe, mostly centring in West and East Germany.\n\nThe game is a turn-based strategy and focuses on the player building and training units that are used to attack the opposing side. The game was released for 8-bit consoles as well as 16-bit consoles. Battlefield Germany received mixed reviews upon release. Reviewers mainly criticised the tempo of the gameplay and lack of innovation from the original. Some critics, however, praised the graphics and viewed the hard difficulty favourably.\n\nThe game is a turn-based strategy and revolves around a fictional conflict between the powers of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.[1] The player has the choice of choosing to control either NATO or Warsaw Pact forces at the beginning of the game.[2] The player will begin the game on either side of Europe depending on which side was chosen; if NATO was picked, the player will start at western European countries (France, West Germany, Denmark)[3] whereas if the player sides with the Warsaw Pact, the game will begin in eastern Europe.[4][2] The map is hexagon-shaped and allows the player to move their units in six directions.[4] Each side has a variety of units; infantry move at a slower pace than mechanised infantry however armoured units are able to withstand more damage than regular units.[2] The game displays two maps on screen; the larger, central map displays the current situation whereas a smaller map to the corner of the screen displays a mini-map of Europe, which runs north from Denmark to southern France.[3]\n\nThere are seven types of units in the game.[4] Each unit has a set of statistics which is displayed in the interface once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points.[4] During the game, both sides have the option to request air support that can be used to attack enemy units. If the other side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat.[4] The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.[2]"},"127366":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Synsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"7ea9b132-4314-46e6-a19c-a98a7eeac0b6.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2529c28b-081b-4672-acc5-a1ada4ae2e3e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b91997f6-accc-49ff-9194-c3ccb8054247.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb4b782d-29a7-4c3b-a1f2-2004f28403f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cafee131-a884-4c5f-ae95-e2939f6a8f01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Beach Buggy Simulator","Overview":"In this game you control a beach buggy that’s competing in the Dune Trials.

You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, with the top half of the screen containing an arrangement of bricks, most of which can be destroyed. You must move the paddle left and right so as to make contact with a ball, and thus deflect it (using the walls at the sides strategically) into the bricks, some of which require multiple hits to destroy. Wipe the destructible bricks out, and you move on to the next level; fail to keep the ball in play and you lose one of your 5 lives.\n\nSome destroyed bricks release power-up tokens, which must be 'caught' with the bat as they fall. Functions include multi-ball, a larger paddle, and the ability to 'catch' and relaunch the ball each time, which makes it a lot easier to gain access to precise bricks or areas.\n\nBatty also has enemies flying around and dropping bombs towards you - the bombs cause your bat to stick for a second, perhaps costing a life. Many levels contain magnets at the top of the screen, which make the ball's path harder to predict. The two player mode gives each player access to half the playfield, so co-operation is required.","Publisher":"Encore","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"127368":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Access Software, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"30c3fb49-a34e-4306-a63d-89062aefc929.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2c5804cf-5069-44b1-afdf-549a0421bd53.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"73b74330-ed07-4bf6-8d5e-1c82ce951915.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b3041b63-6c2d-469f-956a-97ee40b2b3c0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1bec4949-3151-441e-b4ad-4f762f1d8882.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d0c02652-3954-4fe0-86bb-ebb113fc240b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"ede01955-54cc-45e2-b1a8-0d0a0fade15c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bca1ce1f-c0a3-4d71-980c-4462be56985d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"19cd5106-ef75-45c0-8361-7ca399c9a9bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"60a05eb2-3b8d-4488-b8cc-8892cf50de9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1c0ec512-da7a-4ac0-a853-756e01279dde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"14c6000a-7ab0-4947-83ea-3bb2690edcf2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Beach-Head II: The Dictator Strikes Back","Overview":"The Dictator from the first Beach Head game is back, but World War 2 is over.

Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.\n\nThe port for C16 and Plus\/4 computers only contains the General Quarters, Battle Stations and Final Battle sequences.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beach_Head_(video_game)"},"127370":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Beam Software Pty., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"7cf0db79-9b30-4b0f-83f0-26c2d8174095.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"34f11b39-bfde-41b2-9bc8-4fa45744c645.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2de310fd-8207-4818-b10d-03b5dc141547.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8682aae7-95bc-43d0-84a7-3f6108efbadc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f6497b9f-6681-46a3-b6d9-1120ce0e040c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"73ad8f1b-12a9-4370-9e40-c9ff214f86c4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"28a0ded7-4fc8-4a26-8e29-88337e015efe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"51bfc67a-e5da-4db1-91c0-1ae96113a3f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bedlam","Overview":"Bedlam is a vertically scrolling space shoot’em-up.\n\nSpace fighter shoots patterns of swirling aliens and stationary cannons, collects extras and fights boss ships – Bedlam is ordinary shoot’em-up material, stretched out over 16 short levels and spiced up with your standard two-player option.\n\nWhile ZX Spectrum and C64 see a genuine space shooter with full-screen backgrounds and level variations, CPC and DOS get bare-bone versions stripped down to Galaga level.","Publisher":"Go!","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"127371":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zeus Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b83143a1-49ec-4b28-b178-9b4094b65cec.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a35bff2-aba3-4314-b18b-0c6d39df946b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"381614d9-3a56-4add-ab18-4f2bab42ad20.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ff7e8dec-f8cd-46be-9d36-05c1cef68ff4.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7b301527-c2e6-4a46-aa58-1c5443cb924e.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"57eb8818-eea5-4998-adfa-2dc9ec8ce5b7.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bestial Warrior","Overview":"Sagar, the biggest fortress ever known to man, had become a challenge for most of the mercenaries.

More swords will be needed as they will break after awhile.\n\n- Egg Shen is a magician who has vowed to stop the ancient prophecy from coming about, and fights with magic bolts which can turn later on into more powerful lightning if magic potions are found. \n\nEach character has an energy status bar at bottom of screen represented by a Yin and Yang Symbol that slowly disappears but can be replenished by finding food. A weapons symbol is shown if they possess it and magic potion symbol will give them extra strength if found. You must alternate among the 3 characters to keep their status from falling too low and dying, and each has to pick up their own appropriate weapons. They all can move forwards and backwards, jump, duck and attack at different heights.\n\nThey have to fight through several levels including the streets of Chinatown, where martial artist enemies await and gunmen that must be avoided until more experience is gathered. Further on, you go into the sewers where additional monsters must be avoided by jumping over them. Then they will reach the rooms of the underground lair of Lo Pan where large-hat wearing elementals called Storms await.

Monkeys and hoops of fire appear with the monkeys having to be jumped over and the hoops jumped through but some hoops can be walked under. There are also bags of money that can be jumped up and collected but on a harder difficulty these become golden eggs which can hatch if not collected releasing a bird. If you touch the monkey, bird or fire then you lose one life. \n\nAct 2: You have to collect ten balloons in this single screen platform game while avoiding being touched by the strongman, Otto who wanders around the screen. Some platforms appear and disappear but you can fall down one level, if you fall more then you lose a life. As well as steps to climb you can jump up to a higher level but only through the gaps that appear. If you touch Otto or jump up into a platform then you lose a life.\n\nAct 3: You are riding an unicycle and you must ride it 100m within a time limit from right to left with the screen scrolling constantly but you can move left or right. Wooden platforms appear with some high enough to ride under but to get points you must jump on top of them to land on top of your unicycle. If you jump off the unicycle and land on it without jumping on a platform then you lose a life. You also lose a life if you jump into or hit a platform.\n\nAct 4: The final act is a single screen and sees you bouncing on one of three trampolines where you can jump from one to the other but you must be careful of the fire going upwards from the fire eaters in between the trampolines. There are platforms that can be jumped onto, conveyor belts to move upwards and two trapezes that can be caught to swing around the screen.

Here you are a Birdie in some sci-fi world filled with robots, carnivorous plants, parachutes, raptors, barbarians, lasers, butterflies, magical doors, hyperspace, etc. You should survive in this world with help of your wings and flying techniques.\n\nThe game is flown in third-person view, where you may control a bird moving him\/her left or right, flying up or descending down, and flapping the wings. To fly correctly, the bird has to move in the air at a certain speed. Once the latter increases, the bird is handy. If bird's speed drops below a certain threshold, the bird then follows one of the oldest laws of the universe, gravity. Flapping wings enables bird to gain altitude and flying down on the wings increases speed.\n\nThe scoreboard on the screen tells you your speed (red = stall), altitude, the remaining time before the night, your life energy (no energy = game over). Flying at altitude for too long will attract predators, give no points, and exhaust the energy unnecessarily. Eating butterflies allows you to recover energy, but remember that eating too much makes you aggressive!\n\nThe environment, where Birdie is flying, will change during the game. Starting in the forest, you will visit other dimensions through Magical Doors as well as descend the dungeons, and even meet lamas.","Publisher":"Ere Informatique"},"127381":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Topo Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"92e7ccb6-e3f5-4a9d-9bf3-e5bd8262c429.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"95250dd0-87fc-444b-b6e2-f0774d1415a6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d50076a6-5a76-4934-b0c6-ec2ed88ca03d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"92175999-1d21-45b7-8b31-c7b57b9308ec.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"79a3f10d-3c0a-4e09-b0e8-122e215de42b.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Black Beard","Overview":"Red Beard, an old pal of Black Beard has stolen Black Beard's treasure map.

Zangrim had defeated the wizard Anakar the Wise by turning him to a stone statue before overthrowing King Tauraus. A hero is needed to defeat the evil warlock and return the peace and happiness back to MariGold - and you are that hero. You were an apprentice to a wizard called Goff but your training was cut short when he was killed by demons and with all the magic books destroyed your magic powers became limited. You have, however, discovered a parchment explaining that Anakar's six magical eyes have been scattered over the land and if returned to his statue, the secret on how to defeat Zahgrim will be revealed. You have to set out across the land looking for the eyes before making the journey to the warlock's castle and defeating him.\n\nBlack Magic is an action game with role-playing elements. The main playing area is viewed from the side, with the screen scrolling in multiple directions when you move. You start your quest on the surface of the land as the class Apprentice, and you are armed with limited amounts of arrows and two types of spells, though more can be found as the game progresses. You must search the land on the surface and venture deep underground into areas connected by ladders on your quest. As you explore you will encounter many creatures, and if you are touched or shot by them you lose part of the health gauge; when it empties you die and it is game over. Food can be found scattered around and can be used to top up your health or stored on your person for later usage. \n\nAs you progress and complete tasks your experience points increase. Collect a certain amount pf them and your class is promoted to Wizard and then to Sorcerer, before you become Necromancer, which is needed to defeat Zahgrim. The types of spells you have and use also increase when you move up a class. You will also encounter trapped prisoners who require freeing just by walking through them.","Publisher":"Erbe Software S.A.","ReleaseYear":1987},"127383":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"4c5a593e-44b4-4e00-92c5-49c71e196df8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"41d3eb8e-0f80-4770-ac16-6159a9b087af.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"57698e56-2be5-4b00-8713-bf0808d65c8d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4e789f61-41cf-4a74-8831-90eb19352902.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7dd3bd1a-6eff-4381-9710-8e46a178db90.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2954f0fd-7a46-4e19-8e54-b9d0dd89f25e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d4128a46-0063-4143-af41-f5ea8e7ee609.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4505df21-269d-427d-84f2-26ede580cb1b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Blade Warrior","Overview":"Blade Warrior is a beat'em up video game, released in 1991 by Image Works\n\nThe game is a mix of adventuring and battling, in which players are tasked with collecting magical items and exploring the landscape of the game via the in-game map while fighting off enemies.

Guards that were entrusted with the task of protecting the town have disappeared within one night.

Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest.\n\nSix character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer. The last two can be promoted when specific conditions are met during gameplay.

The next screen has gaps which you must jump across, with the right distance in mind. After that comes a similar screen, only the pits are filled with pikemen who lower and raise their pikes. Timing is necessary in order not to be impaled as you jump over the pikemen. The fourth screen has the object from screen one hurtling across the screen, so your jumps across the pits must be timed so that you don't jump into its path. The fifth screen is a variation on the third, but with an arrow shooting over your head so that timing must take both the pikemen and the arrow in account. The game procedes in a similar fashion, with different combinations of projectiles, pikemen and pits.\n\nYour bell-ringer has two different jumps. One is for jumping up in the air, so that you can avoid projectiles, and the other one is a long jump for bridging gaps. Each screen must be crossed within a short amount of time, or Quasimodo will be struck by lightning.","Publisher":"Blaby Computer Games","ReleaseYear":1986},"127417":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"f1641a85-89f1-4f71-9e02-50198712f3db.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8da8d918-cdee-4e0a-8171-dab967d44f1d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"946ea389-816e-4f0e-afce-2225b0db6ace.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"805771e8-d795-4e7b-b18d-f6dd25837c24.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1e81d127-0c5f-43a4-b8e2-f6f92180d859.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Aqua","Overview":"The story of this game is original; a bubble begins its quest from the bottom of the ocean, and you need to guide it through the dangers of deep water to the liberty of the surface!

Working from his artificial satellite orbiting around Saturn and helped by his faithful army of cyborgs, Professor Gern B. Dick has successfully designed a time-travelling machine. As a way of testing his new invention, he travels to different time periods to collect iconic historical items. Suddenly the machine malfunctions and explodes, scattering parts (called Anachronons) in 10 different locations and time periods. As a side effect, it appears that the destruction of the machine also distorted the space-time continuum and the existence of the very Universe is now at risk.\n\nProfessor Gern B. Dick then hastily designs a second time-travelling machine that will be used both to send back the historical items scattered around the lab to their respective periods and to collect the Anachronons from the same time periods. To spice things up a bit, the professor army of cyborgs went crazy and have decided to attack any human entering the lab. \n\nThat's obviously when the player is called into action, having been selected among 12 billion humans because of his skills in both technology and combat sports - the structure of the lab prohibiting the use of fire arms.\n\nBefore starting, the player is given the opportunity to customize his character by allocating points to 3 attributes: Strength, Agility and Vitality. Strength will determine the damages dealt to enemies, Vitality how many health points the hero starts with and Agility, his running speed and how far he can jump.\n\nThe player's mission is to collect the artifacts from different time periods that have been scattered around the 16 floors and the 10 levels of the lab and to retrieve the parts of the time-travelling machine that ended up in the Past. In the lab, the hero can run, jump, hit and kick cyborgs. Elevators let him go up a floor and keys will let him access areas that are outside of his reach.\n\nWhen destroying cyborgs, the percentage of the Fifth Axis (the number in the top right corner) is increased. Every 10 percents the hero is teleported to a specific time periods (Ancient Egypt, European Middle Ages, Paris from the 1980's, etc.) that offer a slightly different gameplay. Within a time limit, the hero must reach the end of an horizontal-scrolling level to retrieve one of the Anachronon items, while avoiding or destroying the obstacles and projectiles thrown at him. If successful the player is teleported back to the lab and start a new level.","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseDate":"1985-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"127424":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Adidas Championship Tie-Break"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Starbyte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"0f07634c-0d5c-4422-8b19-e21649c98526.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e70a5bc1-44dd-4c00-b74a-426753bc1a14.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5eb84ae5-a582-4b8e-bf07-9e4335156b56.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1c51f402-6ddf-4a66-ac80-85af707a8e44.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"45eee550-7813-47f5-9957-db64c0393058.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7420bd07-b3a8-4e90-8781-0c741fef7393.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2f200b54-e3cb-4e54-998a-260f52e67870.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Adidas Championship Tie Break","Overview":"This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective.

Something that differentiates it from other beat 'em ups of the time, is the fact that you will have to defeat all your enemies with a sword, and also protect yourself with a shield.\n\nThe argument takes us to a futuristic city devastated after a nuclear disaster, where the law of the strongest prevails. The protagonist (Geitor), controlled by the player, is in charge of pacifying the city. For this, you must go around the city to the headquarters of the Townsman to lead a revolt that would bring you to power and thus to the establishment of the peace in Metropolis. To achieve this your ultimate goal is eliminating the five nuclear tanks which are in possession of the evildoers of the city.\n\nThere are three races of thugs who will try to prevent you from reaching the headquarters of the Townsman: The Warriors of Death, leading experts in handling the sword and shield, as is our hero; The Dartfire, nasty-looking mutants who throw fireballs; and The Girlkiller, a gang of women who are as beautiful as aggressive beasts.","Publisher":"The Power House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"129104":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Incentive Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"9dde0201-b5f1-40d5-8b2f-1097558ad490.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"200c084a-95ec-4512-9faa-3e20d4ef09d2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bc574889-c7f1-4b76-a4e7-b32ccd73cf00.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7f54a20a-ceed-420d-b301-d90d71ff6514.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"324f181c-1fcc-4f3d-9112-338f0db595e1.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"3D Construction Kit","Overview":"This package allows users to create their own 3D worlds, using technology related to the Freescape universe seen in games such as Castle Master and Driller \/ Space Station Oblivion.

Only one small nebula remains, but while making the intergalactic jump, the Orion is taken over by an alien race known as the Zimen.\n\nIn an attempt to get rid of the Zimen, the players control four robots - Captain Slog, Plot the Navigator, Engineer Knut, and Able Spaceman Bodd - which they use one at a time. Each robot is situated in different areas of the ship. Some robots can easily navigate their way through the maze of 230 rooms, while others are temporarily trapped in their rooms.\n\nWhen a robot comes into contact with the Zimen, its energy is quickly drained. When all of its energy is depleted, the robot will stop functioning, and the only way it can be restored is if a passing robot transfers its energy with the non-functional one.\n\nThe Zimen materializes suddenly in the Orion's passageways with deadly persistance, and can easily trap the outnumbered crew into a corner. To help them, the robots can throw bouncing bombs at the Zimen, gaining points when they have been destroyed. \n\nControl panels scattered throughout the ship give a robot access to code screens. When decoded, these will unlock matter-transmitters and lifts, meaning that the robot crew can move through the ship and closer to the ultimate goal: locking into the Bridge Computer. When all four have done this, the Orion will be safe.","Publisher":"Bubble Bus Software","ReleaseDate":"1987-12-13T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"129106":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Elite Systems Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Quiz","Images":[{"FileName":"126048b6-520b-4b08-98d1-601285d735dc.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2dbdd39-c73f-4bf9-b5d2-c455063c2a84.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74cd95f9-9ae1-4718-8940-454b7a7b5ac8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bdd04868-fbbe-4470-9bc4-db851d83b49e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a5db45c1-858c-49e9-91ff-9e689d7f0af9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"effe494d-f7a1-49b3-b68a-88927981a316.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f94a79df-c938-4774-839e-c288fec47c5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"492ac881-f944-42fa-b268-d360e6d67830.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5e4f4ba3-2ea4-4ff3-bba1-0cf3c7137224.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"A Question of Sport","Overview":"This is the game of the long running BBC quiz show of the same name.

At least the player has two tricks to help himself: he can change the direction of the white pixels by pressing a button (limited) and jail them when drawing a closed line around them. This is possible because the pixels are either confined to the coloured or uncoloured parts. \n\nAfter finishing a level a new one starts with three changes: one more white pixel, an extra life for the player and one additional usage of the \"direction change\" button.","Publisher":"Firebird Software Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IgmlrHUV2xI"},"129362":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Orpheus","Images":[{"FileName":"451da153-9522-4f1e-bac1-620c674a6a02.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d90282c9-7124-47d2-9251-b3b4a3b69e27.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f420fc50-051f-4224-bfa3-07ca1d3732c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1a49dc4f-53ad-4428-9daa-f1dd5e74cfa0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a756d908-cedb-4eb0-b0d2-778f42160ba3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Young Ones","Overview":"The Young Ones is a video game based on the British comedy television series, The Young Ones.

West Bank has nothing to do with the middle east and everything to do with a hot-shot winner. It brings a bar room brawl into your front room without your getting a black-eye, or spilling red-eye on the carpet yet still letting you be the quickest dead-eye west of Wapping. \n\nThe screen shows three saloon doors, each assigned a key. Any could swing open at random. Press the appropriate key and you could blow away whatever's behind it. If it's a low down, no good sidewinder of a bad man then watch your bounty money tot up as indicated by the dollar bags above the doors. But if you're too quick you might shoot the Mae West proportioned bar maid, and that'll cost you, as well as her, a life. But before she can ask whether that's a gun in your pocket or are you just glad to see her another door swings open. This could be the clown with five hats. Shoot 'em off - but watch it - under the last could be money or a bomb. One's a winner - the other could cost a life. \n\nThe greater your first round success, the less baddies you'll meet in the second round, which is marginally faster than the first. If you're top drawer here, then shoot through the final showdown at the Pretty OK Computer Game Corral. Now, instead of doors, three heavy dudes confront you. You can't draw before them - and you don't know who'll draw first, so your reactions have to be razor sharp. Then banga-bang-bang and mash all three - the faster you do it the higher your bounty bonus. \n\nThis one you'll all be gunning for - it combines larfs with thrills, quick reactions with' brains.","Publisher":"Dinamic Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_PJe1m9hINM"},"131421":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ashby Computers and Graphics Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"c3815f59-f336-474b-870a-e045b44152ec.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fff0783a-104a-41fe-96db-c3a951952e82.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0f8dde75-4810-4ba7-860b-2983e475f60a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a8fcdcd4-6721-4020-a9f7-5ed42af9ee2f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d41bb2fe-9f63-4c68-92a0-9bf546f84e70.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1daf4875-cffa-4d74-8dd0-f9843951482c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"35aa185d-2715-4f8f-a7d7-f547c351de45.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sabre Wulf","Overview":"The ACG amulet (a reference to Ultimate's formal name of Ashby Computers and Graphics), has been split into four pieces, which are located in different parts of a jungle, and you're the intrepid explorer sent to locate them.\n\nThe game takes place on a large map, and the viewed area often includes section which overlap and can't be reached directly, due to the huge shrubs and trees which are used as borders.\n\nThe gameplay has many similarities to Ultimate's earlier Atic Atac title (even though they charged almost twice as much for it).

Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.\n\nEnemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:\nShooting them with his gun.\nKicking them by jumping onto them.\nShooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.\nCrushing them with an elevator.\nWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.\n\nWhile Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. \n\nJust because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.\n\nOtto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.\n\nIf Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.","Publisher":"Quicksilva","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elevator_Action"},"135561":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Torus","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy; Vehicle Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"ade3b7c2-1b3b-4431-b729-329225346979.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c64f4ebf-e0d1-44a9-9a67-195a0eb878a3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1c6f2f99-2089-4ee6-a86d-d01e3604909d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2b53862f-0581-4e89-8c64-012f28789546.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cffff18c-e0f6-4425-b1de-fa12882bfff5.jpg","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Elite","Overview":"Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"135891":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"500cc Grand Prix 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"79f2f94e-56c8-4480-9dd3-9da26319397b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2bc26180-fbc0-41b6-b4a2-8d8349a2c003.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bd2ef590-26b6-4383-8cc5-3266d9bfaeab.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"be4b72fb-380e-4c4b-8dc5-72729b73ac1a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf7c66e2-1e23-4639-a8ab-76b96a1367c4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Grand Prix 500 2","Overview":"You can choose between 4 bikes, 12 tracks (including favourites like Brno, Suzuka and Spa), with 1 or 2 players in this Grand Prix motorcycle racing simulation.

Originally conceived in 1983 by Level 9 as the Middle-Earth trilogy, the standalone 8-bit releases of Colossal Adventure, Adventure Quest and Dungeon Adventure were enhanced and published in this renamed compilation Jewels of Darkness. The Amiga version is the update of the original text-only Middle Earth Trilogy. Jewels of Darkness enhances the original text-only incarnations released for 8-bit platforms by adding graphics, more extensive text descriptions, an extended parser that understands many more commands and other user-friendly features. The subsequent games in this trilogy are full of illogical puzzles and paper-thin plots, although Dungeon Adventure does add a D&D style magic system to make it more interesting. These games originally had references to Lords of the Ring novels that were later removed, possibly to avoid charges of copyright infringement.","Publisher":"Rainbird","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jewels_of_Darkness"},"135901":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Level 9","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e857ae7f-c779-45bf-abdc-07575389e053.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"615c4bb2-62f1-4209-9f7d-1c5665b77d4a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10555c3f-8128-4ca5-8ea8-3900775fc551.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f946612f-f7a8-4aa6-9e43-7f008f45661f.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"af07d45f-c2e9-45b5-afb9-1013194a37ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"eb15d2c1-18cf-40a5-8c44-baaa9a6dbfe7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Knight Orc","Overview":"Knight Orc is very different from anything you have seen before from Level 9. Their adventure system has been upgraded before, but this time it has been upgraded beyond recognition. So too have their graphics. Gone are the rather rudimentary and meaningless ‘representations’ replaced by ‘digitised’ pictures. Amiga owners get the best of the deal here, for there is more colour per picture on that machine than the others – including the Atari ST. But it is the mode of play that has changed most dramatically. No longer do you have to make a map, and slavishly follow it move by move to return to a place you have visited earlier. No longer do you have to remember where you dropped an object that you may need later. All that is required is that you know which object you need, or which location you want to reach. If that makes playing Knight Orc sound dead simple, then forget it! To offset the ease of operation, the adventure is endowed with more than its fair share of independent characters, with minds of their own, who get in your way, grabbing the very item you are looking for, and attack you with relentless determination. Having spent many hours playing this game I must admit that I didn’t actually finish it: I’m not sure that I want to finish wandering about this strange new world inside my Amiga. Of all the Amiga adventures I have played this is the best - try it and see.","Publisher":"Rainbird","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knight_Orc"},"135902":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Level 9","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"6bdd032f-c0af-4c42-a2ff-cc54be74f4e8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"ce361ea6-e4ad-47f0-8f99-2784d1ff5c72.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"09dfabfd-7729-4580-91f9-4597083d89fa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d1a2471c-40e8-4d8e-8513-809346343536.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6d827a13-21b8-45c0-9636-139d6a422685.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"14e624d4-84b0-4d9a-98da-70626bb01eef.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"95ec790e-8732-46a0-894d-ad20a6eee8d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lancelot","Overview":"Travel back to the Age of Chivalry when knights were bold, galloping across the countryside and rescuing damsels in distress.

The computer version features 2 players, both human-controlled - on TV there were 3 teams of 2 (one amateur darts player and one to answer questions).\n\nThe first round uses a custom board which is split both inwards (4 separate grades representing 30, 50, 100 and 200 points respectively) and around (10 sections lettered A-K, representing a different subject each). The first player must choose a category to aim at, and shoot a dart at it. If they hit one of the sections for that letter, they get that score and are asked the question. If they hit another category they get no bonus but are asked that question - if it's still there. Each players gets 3 goes at this, with increasingly tough questions worth 30, 50, 100 points.\n\nRound 2 involves each player throwing 3 darts at a standard board, with the player who scores the most getting asked a question, with the value of the darts on offer. If they get it wrong, the other player gets a chance, for the points THEY scored. This is repeated 3 times.\n\nAfter these 2 rounds, the player who is in front gets to aim at a board with 8 black segments, 8 red ones and the bullseye. The bully scores 50 points, the others reds score a randomly-selected value between 15 and 45, the blacks score zero, and hitting a red for the second time loses you that prize - hence the presenter's catchphrase \"keep out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for 2 in a bed\".\n\nOnce the player has finished the round, they choose whether to gamble their score against the final Prize Board. 101 points must be scored in 4 darts (in the TV show it was 6 - 3 for each player).","Publisher":"Macsen Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"138471":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alternative Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"6ec034a6-b924-43ae-9bff-e309f3776d90.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"bda40821-73eb-48c4-8b76-3eea06f17ef0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a149ff7e-f13c-402b-807d-88734803b7a3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d05ba2a4-9775-451b-97b5-dc4e47716bc3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f143e849-9210-4c3f-ac43-513b5ca378a0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bd83e90f-5146-4fab-90b9-ebc16379db2f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a7e88959-ac83-40df-9af4-c58a65d18947.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4284ce2c-39c8-4c43-92b6-2c3092147ccd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d84cf865-0d32-49d6-b672-ce3b7f38dd31.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bully's Sporting Darts","Overview":"There is one thing you should know right from the start: I hate darts.

It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.\n\nDragon Spirit is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.\n\nPlayers can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.\n\nThe NES version is unique in that it presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay mode. Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with \"A New Legend\" being its subtitle. In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her. \n\nThe NES version also adds a new initial stage. If the player survives it, the game continues in a \"Blue Dragon\" game much like the original arcade game. If the player fails to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called \"Gold Dragon\" begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit points, and features a different ending.\n\nAlso of note, the TurboGrafx-16 version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed stages.","Publisher":"Tengen","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Spirit"},"138480":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"6697ade0-f252-4e8c-9c11-63a0eaa3bf04.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94e3729d-3351-405e-a473-7aeae4e8586a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"90d38a78-90d9-4101-b39e-bb41a71adb58.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"01b79b44-4394-4fd9-9e4f-5a8398f9b39f.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5349a5de-82cb-4e9b-922d-03ec786affdb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2d601886-3fe3-4b14-9c73-f38fe5c33333.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dream Warrior","Overview":"In the future, the world is controlled by corporations rather than governments, and wars are fought in a dream world rather than in reality.

For example, if you have a 2 in a column header, that means you have to place 2 circles side by side in this column. If you have a 3 and 2, then you have to place 3 balls side by side and 2 other side balls next in this column. It's the same for the lines. Finally a table requires that all order (columns and rows) are fulfilled.\nAnother thing: when you finish a painting, you save money.

The CPC version unleashes macho cop Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti onto the streets to protect fashion model Ingrid from the psychotic Night Slasher and his army of goons in eight side-scrolling levels. \n\nAll eight stages actually take place on the same (very long) game map; only the starting location differs. In each level, the goal is to meet a kill quota: a certain number of enemies must be taken out to advance automatically to the next stage. Enemies come running along the street, hide in trash cans or shoot from windows, armed with throwing knives, machine guns or rocket launchers. Also present: dive-bombing ducks(!). Cobra can take a few hits before he loses a life; an extra one is awarded every 10.000 points.\n\nAt the start, Cobra is unarmed and must punch out the bad guys, but some enemies leave behind hamburgers that when picked up give one of three weapon power-ups: a machine gun, a pistol or a throwing knife, each with only limited energy, which can be refilled by collecting another hamburger.\n\nStarting in level three, Ingrid will appear and Cobra must follow and protect her. She can't be harmed though, at least until level six, when the Night Slasher appears. Failing to protect Ingrid means the loss of a life.","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YLuzFeSv3j8"},"142148":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Softbook","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"a4b77b81-cc44-4d01-80c9-39ec03f9f4ee.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crystann: Le Donjon De Diamant","Overview":"Get ready for the worst, Crystann, because you decided to bring back the precious jade statuette hidden deep in the Diamond Dungeon.\nYour crazy adventure will lead you through sixty rooms, on countless ladders, swing ropes,\nendless falls that may be end up on one of the many bloody peaks scattered throughout the dungeon.\nYou'll even have to dive into the boiling waters of the underground river that runs through the caves!\nYou'll have to fight against the filthy medusoids, dig stone blocks, but will you be able to avoid the hidden traps?\nCourage!

Being in Redhawk mode uses up energy, so this must be used sparingly.The screen display is in comic book style, with the last 3 drawings on screen at each time.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"143485":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ba6d6b73-4823-4685-9e0a-8dd27ce37801.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f0467911-d85b-4676-acab-577d967e256a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4930b5e4-fdb9-4c0a-9c9b-35d25b92566f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"89e927da-252d-4609-8952-ebe6359fad25.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b9cb0b82-722c-4e2b-9e45-9539d3208f16.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d1834f3-6e43-4622-a275-91bf15f34586.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b2c8bf1c-a3c3-4375-9bcf-5c9df85115ed.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f14e4d25-a445-4e21-a922-92fae1447e08.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"5d7dad80-68da-488a-a3ae-a2e70658d452.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"879b3abd-584e-4043-b2ed-9fc8a83b2d4b.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d469987e-18db-48bf-b635-195c8c0d8e89.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d6d18189-a26c-405d-8a0f-fc45cff45fb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Robocop","Overview":"Patrolman Alex Murphy was killed on the streets of Detroit.

It was distributed internationally outside Japan by Atari Games. The player takes control of a secret agent who must rescue his female partner from a terrorist organization. Rolling Thunder was released for various computer platforms in 1987 and the Family Computer and Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. The original arcade game has also been included in various classic game compilations as well. The player takes control of Albatross, a member of the WCPO's (World Crime Police Organization) \"Rolling Thunder\" espionage unit. Albatross's mission is to save a missing female agent named Leila Blitz from a secret society named Geldra located in New York. Albatross must travel through two different segments or \"stories\", each composed of five stages, for a total of ten stages. Depending on the DIP switch settings, the player has the option to start the game from any point in \"Story 1\" (allowing the player to skip any of the first four stages if desired). On each stage, the player can enter doors to hide and take cover from enemies, as well jump over to higher or lower floors with rails, including stairs. The stages in \"Story 2\" are essentially harder versions of their \"Story 1\" counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of each stage, scenes from Leila's capture and ensuing torture are shown on a large monitor screen. The player begins the game armed with a standard-issue pistol, which can be substituted with a fully automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the shoot button. The player can find ammunition for either weapon by entering doors which are marked \"bullets\" or \"arms\". If the player runs out of machine gun ammo, they will switch back to the pistol. However, if the pistol runs out of ammo as well, then the player can only fire a single slow \"chaser\" bullets on-screen at a time until more ammo is acquired. Despite the presence of a life meter, the player can only take two physical hits from the enemy: a single hit drains half of the meter and the player is killed instantly when struck by a projectile attack such as enemy bullets or lasers, the time reaches 0, and when they fall at any part of an area\/level without a floor. The main enemies in Rolling Thunder are hooded soldiers known as \"Maskers\". Maskers are dressed in various outfits and colors, which determines their strength and attack pattern respectively. Some Maskers do not shoot, but throw grenades instead, while others will shoot their gun while kneeling. Other enemies includes ninjas, mutated bats known as Gelzos, panthers, shrieking yellow creatures known as Blogas and lava men. At the end of the final stage, the player must battle the Geldra leader Maboo to rescue Leila and complete their mission.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bsm3Qs4lBMM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rolling_Thunder_%28video_game%29"},"143499":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c500f06f-ea6a-4962-a11f-6e3073ee7854.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0570d343-db7b-4cf5-ad8b-cb007a4182f1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d29da672-c249-4263-b30f-675be042638a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e29aa895-494d-46ce-bb78-f5d68e755643.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"48205263-384c-4d12-a3b4-18e5c73887af.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"31fb5c81-0505-44f8-9e2b-10046c8b35a1.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rygar","Overview":"An evil being known as Ligar is about to conquer the land of Argool.

Players began in control of Wally (a builder and handyman), but could switch to Wilma (his wife), and their friends Tom (a punk mechanic), Dick (a plumber) and Harry (a hippie electrician) - these last three names drawn from the placeholder phrase Tom, Dick and Harry. Herbert (their baby son) also appeared in the game as a mobile hazard NPC. The player cannot freely change character; the player begins in control of Wally and, in order to switch to another character, must first locate them. Characters not being controlled by the player wander randomly around the map controlled by extremely simple AI - another feature that, at the time, had never been seen before. Lives and health (called \"endurance\") were tracked independently for each character, but the game ended if any character died. The aim of the game is to complete a day's worth of work for each character; each character has a job to do stereotypical of their skill - for instance, Wally has to build a wall, Wilma has to take back three books to the library, etc. Completing the job awards the character with a letter, which spells out a password to open a safe holding everyone's wages. (The eventual password is \"BREAK\" - knowing this does not spoil the game since most of the letters can be seen before jobs are complete; the game requires them to be actually collected before allowing the safe to open.)","Publisher":"Mikro-Gen Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aYMURrdF3IA","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Everyone's_A_Wally"},"144285":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Datasoft Inc.","Genres":"Adventure; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"86e3a80e-7fd0-4ee2-af84-76e5bc11a21d.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"78ded31d-7354-44e4-b6c0-0ab4e998155c.jpg","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"cad58763-9104-4aa8-a205-5e98fd910b64.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"724cd921-1f46-43af-9635-59029ee18662.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"573a1ae7-6290-483e-9b23-fb84521053fd.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5560a1ed-dc82-4dac-999e-5535c1cfee79.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e5042551-15c2-4744-8ca7-1491a5b40971.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6f3218a7-1f97-46ac-965f-c73db75d5df4.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4db11309-18cd-4d28-bbe6-fc376f4baff7.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1a81f63e-d577-4292-b179-02f7f065660c.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"75104619-575d-475c-93d7-ac849adcd06e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0e560951-945c-4ef0-9913-d1cc0ddae434.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6070d4c3-0202-47b2-b300-f905e69069c9.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"33c06f85-106c-4e27-bd23-a24fa0032475.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"71ef5d98-96fa-4516-b03e-990586e9e24e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"49b09fda-4cc0-47e2-a790-554bb2db0136.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0a320944-590e-4ed7-b324-4c076c5421b6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b304fbc4-a29d-4a9f-97a4-c40cedd51878.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0e056306-3e6d-42af-bc57-4c1aa3c98614.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Zorro","Overview":"All the ingredients from the Zorro story feature in this action game - a kidnapped senorita, an evil enemy leader (Colonel Garcia) and his henchmen and of course the obligatory swordfight!\n\nThis computer version of Zorro is a strange beast, he can leap across buildings, fall 50 feet and land like a feather, with neither a scratch to his head or a crease in his cape.

All of this is played out with multiple choice dialogues between Hacker and the other cast members of the series (complete with lo-res digital pictures). The dry humor of the show abounds as you must deal with crises such as the French refusing to continue work on the channel tunnel until Waterloo station is renamed. Fans of the show will recognize much of the material and non-fans should still find enough laughs to keep them interested. The game takes place over 5 working days and at the end the PM has a final discussion with his colleagues Sir Humphrey Appleby and Bernard Wooley who assess his performance at trying to manage the country.\n\nSimilar in style and execution to Mosaic's games based around the exploits of Adrian Mole and The Archers.","Publisher":"Mosaic Publishing","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KxrIMii80jY"},"144923":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Codemasters","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"beb79a2d-353a-4292-8af4-248162906bc1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5d47fb6d-12fe-4414-bf89-87886eccaed5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"53011631-e910-4d6b-b2ca-d66a8d314649.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2c809b87-f574-4a3f-a54e-d07e4ab60d62.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a546963-be6a-448b-9878-c63f7242cf3c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a1ab60b7-a4e2-4425-9d42-4d00d855816a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"dd0db429-db22-480b-88ef-3e7273f0e5e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4b51e2ad-9fa7-4125-8182-849f8fed08df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dizzy: The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure","Overview":"Dizzy's world is being threatened by the evil wizard Zaks.

A Thrall is a simple underling, a pawn in comparison to other more complex characters like Mystics, Heralds, Savages and Assassins.

However that is where the core similarities end compared to the C64 version, because in this one the graphics are much much better, with highly detailed Zombies, much better scene graphics, and an improved graphical UI such as the Zombie symbol and weapon in hand. It's just a shame with all of these versions I've tested so far, there is NO scary music and no sound effects.

To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit. Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the \"E\" indicates the exit. Your mission is not going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine. More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards. Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Narc_(video_game)"},"148569":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"R.T.

The Evil Queen has tricked the Dragon into parting with the sacred Firestone and used it to curse the kingdom with ghostly apparitions and deadly fireballs, and will only relinquish it in exchange for the four charms.\n\nGalaheart is initially defenceless and must quickly find an enchanted crystal in order to defend himself against the cursed apparitions the Evil Queen has flooded the kingdom with. He must then explore the kingdom, destroying apparitions and looking for clues to the location of the four charms. Galaheart can trade with various inhabitants for spells, information and items or attempt to steal them - being caught attempting to steal during trading leads to a \"trial\" in which the player has to attempt to stop on \"innocent\" rather than \"guilty\" with three successively faster alternating arrows. Items can only be stolen if the player has sufficient items to trade for them in the first place. Extra enchanted crystals can be found scattered around the kingdom and the player can use these as initial trading items.\n\nGalaheart has a constantly depleting energy level which is sapped further by contact with the apparitions and which can be restored by collecting food, \"trading energy\" which is depleted during trading and can be restored by collecting trading tokens and weapon energy which is depleted by firing and can be restored by collecting small crystals. Galaheart has an initial allocation of lives which can be lost by running out of energy, colliding with a fireball or being executed after being caught stealing. Extra lives can be found scattered throughout the kingdom. Most collectible items are of a fixed type, but some cycle through the available options allowing the player with careful timing to collect the powerup most needed at the time.\n\nWhen the game ends (either through successfully returning the Firestone or losing all the lives) the player is ranked in a pseudo-mediaeval ranking from serf through various English titles of nobility up to the ultimate accolade of \"Firelord\". In order to achieve the highest ranking, the player must successfully steal the Firestone rather than trading the four charms for it, however it is only possible to steal the Firestone if the player has the four charms available to trade to begin with as with any other attempted theft.","Publisher":"Hewson","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"155880":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"570eb205-211d-4db4-82a2-18865016047c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"783f30e5-a21c-444a-a04c-9d484d1d1a6f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ddf1b0eb-c6ea-4350-94e9-87bb320f613d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4ecf7edf-41f5-4945-be6b-29080faedd62.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9846aff-fa3c-4642-8784-a29aa99d5c1c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"217d8f53-83fa-42d7-8797-12bd0db8f031.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8ac6a5b9-5e24-4bc9-9f18-b5aa198504ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1e312711-746c-4bd5-80d9-66a8d95db755.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Seymour Saves the Planet","Overview":"In the sequel to Seymour Goes to Hollywood, Seymour takes on his first movie role - as an eco-friendly superhero.

Your job is to shoot the little troublemakers that approach you. These troublemakers are harmless at a distance, but they are known to throw fire bombs at a few policemen. When you are killed by one of the troublemakers, one of the policemen replaces you as the one who gets to control the streets. If there is no policemen left, the game is over.\n\nThere are also turret guns located on top of buildings that fire, so you just can't stay on the footpath and hope not to get clobbered by the troublemakers. You just have to cross the road which is dangerous for a policeman in situations like this. When you come to the intersection, you'll come face-to-face with a gang, and you must shoot each gang member before they have a chance to leave you for dead. Once you've shoot all remaining gang members, a man appears holding a woman hostage. The object here is to shoot the man to free her. If you shoot the woman instead, you'll sacrifice 1000 points.\n\nYour score increases when you walk, but score more points if you manage to shoot a troublemaker.

Upon approaching other ships you can board them and do battle with their inhabitants.","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"156456":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"b3710051-74ac-46f6-9d4b-be9dab5b7191.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cb730ac1-3261-4cfe-8685-fe48de6b669c.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dd794786-4be4-4f9f-aa75-7be72d11cbd5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"636f4bad-a691-4e25-b735-d8e2c08b1c9a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"43565eb5-7c8c-4b9e-8938-628a62cf6ee7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f9b73088-f02c-4f26-892d-7e63d08f7ce1.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"87667053-2fa0-451a-bb95-339506719549.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"da633dd1-329f-4437-bd67-96fabbccb909.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"32790371-4055-42d7-b1ab-ed6381e37a32.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fc56f5bd-4449-4f69-859c-43c78117e94d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4098b2e6-9715-47f1-8f70-2db271d2a141.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"62cd063e-8999-456d-99f9-06f72fc415fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Zoids: The Battle Begins","Overview":"Players control a human who has fused with a machine known as a Spiderzoid; this human has been tasked with reclaiming the six parts of a large machine named Zoidzilla.

Each one has its own world record and a target time\/distance\/score to reach. Fail and the player loses one of three lives. After completing all events successfully they repeat with tougher targets. The Amstrad, Commodore, and ZX Spectrum 48K versions of this game feature eight sporting events: cycling, giant slalom, penalties, pistol shooting, rowing, ski jumping, spring board diving, and tug of war), while the ZX Spectrum 128K release has four additional events: 100 metres hurdles, javelin, sprint, and the triple jump; making twelve games in all.\n\nRowing, 100 metres hurdles, and cycling are pure tests of joystick waggling; this is a feature of many other events. The penalty shoot-out involves timing the run-up then pressing fire to set the angle of the shot. In the ski jump, timing the launch and landing are crucial. The tug of war involves choosing a candidate the player feels can beat and then out-waggle them.\n\nIn the triple jump, the player runs to the line before holding down fire for the right length of time for each of the 3 phases of the jump (45 degrees is optimal). The hurdles event involves running to and pressing fire to clear the hurdles. \n\nPistol shooting gives the player limited time to correctly move a sight into position, before firing as close to the centre as possible. This is made harder by only being able to move up and towards the target, which prevents being able to correct over-movement.","Publisher":"Ocean","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"157075":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b67d6261-7495-44e5-8441-2177e065af4d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"07559296-5fce-44e8-a44b-cae05762861f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1a69acd8-9458-4a19-b576-a2098b2db37e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1570bf6d-5d9f-4cb9-80c7-768ce63bf97e.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f169df01-cc62-4810-a53b-9e37dd23d0b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"99893403-cf4d-4ca8-a6c3-cb3d2e25285c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Fernandez Must Die","Overview":"Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people.

From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world.\n\nIn comparison to the better known console version this game is a traditional fighting game similar to Double Dragon in which the player walks from left to right while battling numerous enemies. Only if all foes are dispatched of, the player can advance in the level. It's also possible to perform special attacks and use weapons. The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental objects like phone boots.\n\nRyu can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units.\n\nThe game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.\n\nA two-player co-operative game is also featured.

The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns.

Ernor, son of King Abner, was the commander-in-chief of the armies of the kingdom of Arngur and was enjoying one of the few breaks that this cruel war offered from time to time, when someone abruptly broke into his shop trying to recover the barely breath. It was a royal messenger who extended his trembling hand to the prince, offering him a worn parchment rolled up and sealed with Arngur's shield. Ernor stood up and without a word took the scroll, broke the seal, opened it, and read:\n\n“Year of grace 1458 of the second era of Arngur. I, Helegan, as counselor and administrator of His Majesty the King, write to you, Prince Ernor, to communicate with the greatest of regrets that your father, King Abner, has passed away after suffering a merciless illness that finally we has snatched.\n\nIt is my duty to inform you that in compliance with the capitular laws of our kingdom, you must take possession of the throne, replacing your father, on the third day after the death of our monarch. By virtue of the laws imposed by King Abner himself, the coronation celebrations will be executed on that day and, if the heir by right is not present, this position will fall on the next successor in the family line, in this case your stepbrother and son of Her Majesty the Queen, Devilus.\n\nBy virtue of the proper functioning of the real states, the following ... \"\n\nErnor could barely continue reading the scroll. The grief that approached him and a strange feeling of dizziness began to take over him. He even wondered what he was reading, what was it he had in his hands. Oblivion took hold of him. He could barely remember who his father was or what he did there. Why was he forgetting? What was happening to him? Why was the parchment impregnated with a pinkish powder whose scent filled his memories? He quickly tossed the parchment into the fire, which exploded in reddish light. Ernor clung to his fondest memories, his father: the king, his kingdom: Arngur, his goal: to reach Arngur before his evil brother Devilus is crowned king in his place and, most importantly, not to forget.\n\nUnfortunately we only have three days to help our knight on his dangerous mission.

These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm. The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.

Instead, your attack command puts you in a fighting stance that allows you to input a series of directional moves. That, combined with the correct feet placement of both fighters (which can be seen in a helpful window) allows you to unleash specific throws and offensive maneuvers that form the basis of the combat in the game.

Alien enemies have occupied the planet in the year 2059. The Alien League Of Cosmic Nations has determined that you are the pilot to take the Slap Fighter (Europe) \/ SW475 Starfighter (US) and defeat the aliens. \n\nThe main feature of the game is its pickup system. You pick up stars and then you choose which powerup you want, pick up one star and you can choose speed, two stars to choose shot (which is the default type of weapon), three stars to choose side shot, four for wing upgrade (which triggers the fancy ship enlargement animation, also gives you a couple seconds of invulnerability), five for bomb shot, six for laser shot, seven for homing missiles and eight for a shield upgrade. \n\nThe shot is the default quick-but-limited weapon, having a rather short range, bombs are very powerful but short ranged and with a big gap between shots, making them hard to use.

A scanner shows the positions of both ships and the ball, so that things don't become disorientating.\n\nThe aim is to guide the ball either into a 'goal' in the middle of each end (scoring 2 points) or onto the goal-line elsewhere (scoring one point). The ball can be steered either by hitting it with the ship or by shooting at it with your craft's beam (which does not injure or impede the opposition craft in any way). In either case the ball moves in a semi-random direction similar to the one you directed it in, but can rebound off the plus-shaped divots in the wall unexpectedly.\n\nThe game lasts for 5 minutes, or until a player reaches the winning score of 9.

Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.\n\nViewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.\n\nThe game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.\n\nThis earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over."},"158428":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"fbbe7897-7b3e-428d-94e7-8b76b8d6162a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a2a5f069-9064-4d04-8cb8-58b495e7b746.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fac3b1ff-db1c-4e3d-a5c5-2783ec1608fc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"88b0cdd9-049a-4f83-97c1-d8724311a2ce.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"06954368-4666-4506-b704-194cee70aa0b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"23bebeb1-684f-463d-9e11-19a12b42bab6.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4df19c6d-0853-452e-bab0-71b679b5137a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"20db2170-621e-4b59-a47a-9d6a86e21b22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rastan","Overview":"Rastan features five levels of hacking and slashing gameplay with a boss at the end of each level.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled.

In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.\n\nPopeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.\n\nThe second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.\n\nPopeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.","Publisher":"Alternative Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"158468":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Fighting; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"865a7ea5-c813-4070-9a5f-4988d12f07f9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5024f646-5aeb-4d3d-9237-b8b6d7ed6d7a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"92c59f0c-1438-4c30-b691-b33da64366d4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"92d70cfc-b871-4ea7-a0d5-a8b73293723c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b23dea00-3f8f-425d-b03f-8ec4f1860587.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"08f22586-ed0f-4c0a-a5ce-9706688a8e28.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"400738fe-cd93-4a8b-af76-bea62ffc84e5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ff7b921f-6e6e-4c31-bb69-40ba869773ee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Popeye 3: WrestleCrazy","Overview":"Popeye has been kidnapped by the evil aliens Kraggs and taken to a desolate asteroid on the edge of the Galaxy.

Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.\n\nThe game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.\n\nThe characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).\n\nThere are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"158493":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"91a1c709-cbbe-4742-a6e0-e3541d83508f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"563e42a1-47b2-4e25-8acb-586f28531f83.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1fe8162d-d6d9-4a85-a6e7-adbacb634512.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e19364f7-3ef6-4e6f-a5a5-f03d8768bedb.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1e3c1f39-50c9-41b5-9af9-964de88996ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3cba18c1-8346-4b9f-9115-fb1fc922bac8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future","Overview":"Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future is based on Britain's classic comic strip space hero.

Dan Dare and his friend Digby fly towards the asteroid, looking to destroy it. While searching for an entrance, Digby is captured by the Treens. Now it falls to Dan alone to save the day, armed with only his laser gun.\n\nThe game is a side-view platformer with light adventure elements, taking place over almost a hundred screens depicting the inside of the asteroid. Dan must complete several goals: to destroy the asteroid, he has to activate the self-destruct. The activation mechanism however is across a large chasm, in the same place where Digby is held. To cross it, Dan must collect four bridging pieces. Once the self-destruct is activated, Dan and Digby must flee the asteroid by using the Mekon's rocket ship. Time is limited: an indicator shows how little time Earth has left. Standing in Dan's way are automated defense emplacements as well as Treens. If Dan is hit, he loses energy. If it runs out or a Treen touches him, he is captured and thrown into a prison cell. Luckily, the cell's door is faulty and he has no trouble escaping, but will lose valuable time.","Publisher":"Virgin Games"},"158494":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Simon Francis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ac817659-4bcb-4f62-a31b-b2cd3b205591.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"e036d82f-2f5c-499e-938f-876f43aaab4c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"01b11427-1d87-4c92-a0cd-a183e5c3df0b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"294f7413-c250-4c31-b930-0a9d29b44f59.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9c81aa0f-29e9-4229-b58e-d66f754bf7d2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"771c6e76-9dfc-48ce-957a-d4134da03cf0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6e1807ab-3877-4b61-ba33-7840abb51312.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Critical Mass","Overview":"Mankind has spread throughout the solar system into vast colonies, which are under alien threat.

There are six events on offer, which represent standard strongman tasks such as truck-pulling, a tug of war and wrestling. Each must be completed within a time limit; points are awarded based on how much time is left.\n\nThe game's control method and design philosophy distinguishes between each of the 8 main muscles Geoff uses. After a joystick-waggling challenge to raise as much strength as possible, you can choose which muscles to assign it to, which adds an element of strategy and memory-testing.\n\nDuring each event, the 8 muscles are displayed on either side of the screen, and as one comes into use it will flash. Controlling a cursor, you must click on this as quickly as possible to achieve maximum effect. Any energy unused on each muscle is kept over for future events.","Publisher":"Martech","ReleaseYear":1985},"158527":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Foursfield","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e47b33b3-f414-4246-b233-1d9b7d538d61.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"27050ccf-9fa7-4545-acdb-a4b85f11d4a2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3835e8cc-7bfd-4e43-8dc7-c91e1a9c6a5f.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"38f13666-b57a-4f4f-b17f-a13db04cdae4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d8d62a2-e048-4268-8393-fee6006a6f43.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9e8f8714-c29d-4227-b719-ada0dbfcf20a.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8755144-7772-44ab-b2d1-6a359b704afd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"49279aa3-9e95-45f7-a01a-fe003c9045f2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7845787e-8d1f-42b9-a1ff-6d3b2eb6d6ed.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"492b0712-d711-403f-bb65-55d1d2de600f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c1bba401-3db2-4ffb-9838-ccbba4942c7d.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"0d3fd798-45ef-498b-905c-4236e2159938.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"5ca4e99c-227e-49d0-8bdc-a187ce721848.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"950d9694-4c7f-4669-97ce-107b6b5abf32.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ghostbusters II","Overview":"The UK-produced adaptation of Ghostbusters II contains three action scenes based on the film:\n\nIn the first scene, the Ghostbusters must collect slime samples from the sewers. One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected.\n\nIn the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled.\n\nIn the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ghostbusters_II_(computer_video_game)"},"158536":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Carter Follis Software Associates","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"e8998c86-faf0-472c-add3-239cdc8d2f16.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1e90eaba-1f99-4d24-8887-d338144d032d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5ccb8365-5b36-4f20-88fe-9d45334a52f2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7388090-ef1c-4d35-b348-6e987e014661.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"344e94c4-a398-4a09-a4cb-5b3482eb792e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ae06e729-9d31-4bad-91dc-42b722b31c17.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f49c1e10-53c6-45a3-9155-bc2a33f45fa7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ab5f7da4-6521-4032-b4af-3281527c6f8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6a97dd29-d955-419c-bd83-71ad100606d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shockway Rider","Overview":"The game takes place in the future where cities are surrounded by \"shockways,\" moving pedestrian walkways.

You can train your players to improve these skills, and sell players you don't rate highly.\n\nMatches are played out via a succession of short animations, in which the home side wears red and the away side blue. At full time you are told how many injuries were incurred. The league season features 15 matches, one against each team, with the top two teams gaining promotion.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"158547":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Access","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"d709eb94-d1b5-4826-b656-2fd00a109661.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"01f1cc51-a8b0-4782-9319-28099330ffa7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f423addc-47fa-46a7-8d32-1d9e1182ecbd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a6030c37-458e-4ddd-b6fb-c08a615ff185.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8523cdb4-4914-4126-891c-e23d194995ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e3f77d9a-7461-4433-8342-284eb62117e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Leaderboard Tournament","Overview":"Leaderboard Tournament is the sequel to Leaderboard which follows the same format as the original but now has four new courses to play on.

You drive out in your specially-equipped vehicle, the Last V8, only to discover that the outside world is more hostile than you would have expected. Your task is now (as commended by a digitised voice at the beginning of each level) simply to get back to the base in as short time as possible.\n\nThe Last V8 is an over-head driving game where you must drive through narrow roads without crashing into anything, and with a strict deadline for your arrival at the base. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of screen space to see where you're driving; two thirds of the screen is dedicated to instruments (speed readout, radiation level and mission objectives). The steering method is not the usual Sprint one; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.\n\nAll versions except the C128 version have two levels. The first one takes place in an almost pastoral landscape where you must reach the scientific base, after which you must find your way back to your own base while avoiding radiation sources. A distance readout will help you find the correct route.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"158551":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Last Duel: Inter Planet War 2012"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"af9dcf12-ebb7-4dd3-84cb-43fda59ab238.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"04eb0ed6-866a-4c9a-b16e-fdac1a97b8e1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2e1439ad-1568-4836-af6b-c1c0bac9c15b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"efee688e-b5e8-4774-86e1-11f0f7c4475d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3418fd3e-782e-42dc-b0fd-db7db8f6ba39.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"343402c7-d06d-4521-9dd7-5adb2b440d39.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d84b6d44-c1ba-4f50-a750-ba886c21e7b1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6abfbdf5-0184-4ca7-a531-6862a98d425c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9510ba5a-1913-4ac6-949f-98e37a2e8a1e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"71bbd7ac-417f-4c53-81e2-1dd11cb76865.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a9387c84-9049-4338-b350-7e96690c0e91.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"779eb916-a07a-4273-a3e7-2ce5fb87ddb0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"860ea93f-821b-4c70-b2d6-56f4ffc21855.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8553c280-dd8b-49fb-9834-eacaa9b78671.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"51c8bebd-d0c5-4dec-996c-880760468211.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4ca23667-b302-4496-a58a-32b80942d07c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1f7e7960-b6f3-41bd-8bc0-89856c863916.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f971e250-9013-4101-932e-f74a6912b7d5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Last Duel","Overview":"Last Duel: Inter Planet War 2012 follows the story of two planets that are in war with each other.

Each level has an exit but this can only be opened when you find a tin opener which is hidden in a Bowel. There are various Bowels scattered over a level but only one will leave behind a tin opener when destroyed, with the other Bowels leaving behind an alien, bonus or a jug to replenish energy. Each bowel though emits bubbles and when touched decreases your energy, which is also lost if a discovered alien touches you. If you run out of energy then it is game over. To help you in your quest to escape, you are armed with a Crizza, which circles around your Kettle and will destroy any bubbles that hit it or a discovered alien which takes multiple hits. You can also send your Crizza forward by holding down the fire button to destroy bubbles and aliens. With your Crizza you must hit a bowel ten times to destroy it which then leaves behind a diamond and when this is destroyed it hopefully leaves behind the tin opener needed. Two players are able to play at the same time with a split screen and each player can either co-operate or leave the other player to do the work and nip in to get the bonuses and items. Before the game starts you can select either level one or four to start from and if you complete level four then you have the option to start on higher levels on your next game.","Publisher":"Alligata Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"158562":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"bf1d11db-0cab-4cf6-867f-3635abd8c87e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9154c216-0fcd-4b43-bdaf-a3e385802c8e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1dee3ee9-8e73-4f83-a06a-112143b62b3d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"69a2c21f-457d-4f2f-baf9-5d56067ba30a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8a52f8f5-6f50-4415-a861-d0aa039fbda8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"15dc6806-47b0-4480-af05-5cf3e730bda9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9e8de1d4-ed8e-4615-bbe4-9f60a870f953.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f5c4c77e-7dd6-42ca-900b-b21c7c33fd3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Kentucky Racing","Overview":"In most funfairs or theme parks you would find a stall which lets you participate in a horse race against other people.

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men's Nerve Center. It is MT-ED's task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. \n\nTo do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time.\n\nBesides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men's Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from.","Publisher":"Streetwise","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"158565":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c845b31c-b37d-4065-a45e-86e2df9b36ba.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"befdbf19-df5c-4f18-ba18-24fd951cda72.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bf1b624e-7215-45d0-8c91-ac5609e04df5.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c5201e8c-433d-4235-9045-47db01cdaf3e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fbce81a4-0d0d-47ad-b641-6f94a1b80691.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8217b700-9711-4dd6-b92d-908449298e1d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Justin","Overview":"Basically, if you remember the hits Head over Heels and Batman, well, it's pretty much the same thing.

Dangerous, especially if you are a frail and tender young girl, plump, lost in the jungle without the slightest Tarzan on the horizon ... An arcade game more classic than it seems. Right, Jungle Jane. Hanging on a vine. At the bottom of the vine, an open pot ready to welcome it. At the top of the vine, a papuan with an ax. Ready to detach a piece of rock which, falling on Jane, will throw her into the pot. But he waits. He is waiting for three of his Papuan brothers to join him.\n\nOn the left of the screen, they jump from the top of a promontory, a vulture slowing down their fall. Jungle Jane has to prevent them from arriving alive on the ground by touching them with the bananas she throws. The papuans fight back with coconuts. An affected papuan falls and crashes to the ground. Jane hit by a coconut loses a life (luckily, she has three).\nIf the heroine ever falls into the pot, she still has a chance to get out of it. A rebel vulture hovers over her; she can jump to try to hang on to it. Advantageous, but this exercise seemed to us absolutely impossible to carry out. A \"bug\" in the program?\n\nEach game board has a number of Papuans to face before moving on to the next. The general principle does not vary from one table to another, but the shooting exercise always becomes faster.\n\nA good little arcade game to have a good time.

Players can control an army of either the Union or the Confederation. There are three types of units: infantry, cavalry and artillery, and it's possible to decide how many of each type the player's army should consist of. After the initial set-up, the battlefield is generated. The goal is to capture the enemy's flag, but it's also possible to achieve a victory by points. Army control is handled with the keyboard - units can move in eight directions. Artillery can shoot over distance, the other unit types can directly attack by simply moving to an adjacent square.","Publisher":"M.C.

Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved. As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute. There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.","Publisher":"Players","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"158573":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"58f9310b-c831-44b5-8df6-39e8603b58f7.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4971089d-189d-4a7b-8c1b-dedf2623f07a.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"81f9a043-fdaa-472f-9a3d-a1856651cebc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"92b6756a-a0cd-4ecf-b43e-95058c352da2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8750f7cd-62fe-410a-8054-6bb052def34f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d2a4dbae-f396-45bb-b70d-9d38724a4509.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e20d6c3d-bd5a-4c40-8dae-22705307bd29.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6b7523df-0973-4c01-a81d-fb0e9399f461.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Joe Blade","Overview":"Tough guy Joe Blade must rescue six respected leaders from the madcap Crax Bloodfinger, who has kidnapped them in different areas of his base.

Being held in P.O.W. camps, these soldiers are effectively out of the war... unless some kind of rescue operation can be mounted. Heavy Forces are too slow and visible to be of any use, but perhaps something smaller and lighter may make it in where larger forces would fail. A small jeep, maybe two, crewed by about 4 people.... minimal enough not to represent too much of a loss and yet suitable enough to aid in rescue. But of course, if these brave men want to succeed AND come back alive; they'll need to fight like animals... they'll need to fight like jackals... Jackal is an overhead view jeep game for up to 2 players. The controller moves in four directions, button A fires your grenades (upgradeable to bazooka) and button B your machine gun which ALWAYS fires to the top of the screen. Your mission is to locate facilities where soldiers are being held prisoner, rescue as many as possible, and escort them to a safe landing zone where they will be air transported away. After that, you'll need to fight a boss battle against the enemy to progress. The NES version is not a straight port of the original Arcade game, but rather a remake. The Arcade version is a continuous battlefield, but the NES version is divided into 6 stages with a boss fight at the end of each stage. Also, enemy and hazard placements are quite different between versions.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"158578":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"4cdaf121-e8e0-4c8c-957d-c7dd8d88dede.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c212e486-9e28-4fd1-a7b7-0eda44f1eed9.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b50fc1d4-b3ab-4317-9758-ee39b7fff6da.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a135fb6a-1e1b-450f-b703-a1d5ed6e3204.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6603d033-d4c5-4bec-958f-638ae2bad974.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eaa38c90-ab12-4066-9a13-58ba1203b0e3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ec652a17-646a-4a7a-879f-686543da9e9c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a45c73e2-5110-4d90-b597-3d24cb4ff446.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5f01ecb9-a184-4915-97ae-ab74f78505ce.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8af06322-b43c-45d8-ad34-c5a1e7dc296a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e5e93da9-9451-4638-8b3f-b665dfc3e3cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Jack the Nipper II... in Coconut Capers","Overview":"Naughty toddler Jack finds himself in Africa, with the aim of progressing through 192 screens of platform action.

Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"158583":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"The Island of Dr. Destructo","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"0a155043-f4b1-44e0-a485-21b82cf53a55.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"038aa735-567a-4ac0-bb26-400a62208ed1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6a37effa-9cd8-4e03-b14c-e4000274dad0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dc284acd-b0bc-4610-a81e-b855643f622c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8eb252af-466f-427b-9794-71745a73e416.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1884c75d-beb4-4e06-91f0-78fa45362422.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e24b6895-1950-4c33-bff5-f481d45b7ef1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"34648288-44ce-4549-9326-3ebe7ac27c36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Destructo","Overview":"You are leading a mission to destroy Dr. Destructo's array of ships, and ultimately his island hideout, over 21 levels.

When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.\n\nAvoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat.

Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy.\n\nThe U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by \"The Boss\", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.\n\nOn May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped \"The Boss\" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.\n\nYour mission is to liberate \"The Boss\" and to bring him back safely.\n\nYou're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where \"The Boss\" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.\n\nYou'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.\n\nIn each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. Once you reach the point where \"The Boss\" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place.\n\nOn the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect \"The Boss\" whose physical condition has been worn out.\n\nWild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you.","Publisher":"Titus Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Y1be57NaNQ"},"158615":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"d1927a6d-d86a-4527-b9a8-a4a92fe0d50b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1faf3944-fc7c-4257-80a7-1cd711127f07.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0241b314-838b-4cb0-86ea-8019ca394ef5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dd8fb1a8-280d-4c8c-937d-3fd115c7998e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8137e977-b6c3-4dbb-b0a3-f6faf4190bea.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5bd3462b-93f8-4176-8b1a-63e4337e5972.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2ba4a32b-67e2-48c0-9794-8298aa220559.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9e4ce7bb-5288-483e-90bf-e3dd5cafc2d7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e2dbf30a-1c4c-4031-9713-27c35eca3dcc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a9270bcb-1338-4ba7-a2f1-fe4f2b14ddf6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f1c76184-0555-4c08-a960-448946f3bbf7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Wild Bunch","Overview":"Set in the Wild West, The Wild Bunch is an adventure game with some graphic and arcade elements where you have to prove your innocence for the murder of a man.

The further North they got, the harder it became until they reached the border between England and Scotland and were halted in their tracks. No matter how hard they tried they just couldn't defeat the Scottish tribes led by a Northern warlord. As the fighting intensified, the Gods of both sides got involved until the ferocity of the armies and the Gods was so intense that the end of the world was imminent. A truce was called between the Gods and the solution was to take a champion from each side and transport them both to a Celtic Otherworld. The aim now was for each champion to attempt to get back to the real world before the other one to be declared the winner. You as the Warlord was chosen for the Celts, while a centurion for the Romans was picked to try to beat you back.\n\nWarlord is a graphic text adventure where the screen has a picture to show what you can see while text describes each location.

It doesn't feature the questing and RPG aspects of the other title and is instead a pure strategy game.\n\nThe player controls the forces of good in the War of the Ring from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. The game begins with the Fellowship of the Ring just having formed in Rivendell and the hobbit Frodo Baggins carrying the One Ring. The ultimate goal of the game is to get the ring bearer to the cracks of Mount Doom to destroy the ring. The game is lost if the ring bearer is killed or corrupted by the ring's influence or if Sauron's forces capture the city of Minas Tirith.\n\nThe game takes place in three different views. The Middle Earth Map displays the whole of the land on one screen, with the player's armies highlighted (unlike the 16-bit versions, enemy armies cannot be seen until encountered). A more detailed view is available in the Campaign Map. This displays much more detail of the land, showing rivers, roads, forests, mountains, towns, et cetera. Units are displayed as shield icons, representing either individual characters or larger military formations. If combat occurs, the Battle Screen is employed, which shows every individual soldier.\n\nOrders to units and characters are given on the Campaign Map. Units can be told to move to a certain position or either join or follow another unit. While giving orders, the game is paused. Time starts running with the appropriate command given from the Middle Earth Map, with units following their movement orders, and stops again if the enemy is encountered. Before a battle is fought, the two party's statistics can be compared on the Campaign Map. The battles themselves are fought in real time. Individual soldiers can be ordered to attack an enemy and it is also possible to directly control each friendly combatant with the joystick. The own forces will not move until given orders, but will defend themselves if attacked. Combat ends if either side is completely defeated. If the ring bearer is involved in a battle he does not wish to be part of, he can use the ring to disappear. This of course can have severe consequences. Using the ring enhances its corrupting influence, and it is of no use against the Nazgûl, who will instead attack only the ring bearer if the ring is worn. Should the corrupting influence become too much, the ring can be given to another character in the same space on the Campaign Map.\n\nEach character and soldier is rated in different categories determining damage rate and strength, amount and depletion rate of energy and more. Elves, dwarves and men move at different speeds. Of special importance is the virtue rating, which determines how fast the ring corrupts the ring bearer. Many of the major and minor characters of the book are featured in the game and can be controlled, including the entire Fellowship, Gollum, and the leaders and captains of the free peoples like Thranduil, Celeborn, Dáin, Brand, Théoden and Denethor.\n\nThe starting positions of the player's units correspond with the setting of the book: the Fellowship is in Rivendell, armies of men in Rohan and Gondor, elves in Lothlórien and dwarves in the northern mountains. It is not necessary to follow the strategy employed in the book and send off the ring bearer alone while having the larger armies fight diversionary battles. It is also possible to keep him well-escorted and break into Mordor through the front gate.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/War_in_Middle_Earth"},"158619":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"0d3db145-79e8-4188-88c7-2a6f762f7847.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"35919bbf-1edc-4d88-ae48-aa4cbc35b75e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8d75c9ca-212c-43f5-ada6-8bcc33ca59a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d9b0beb5-6ba9-4ec1-b7a2-94ec94e9e629.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"e68c9b5a-4078-47ff-a263-b98029335db6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"War Cars Construction Set","Overview":"War Cars Construction Set is a race game where you must race against the computer around a large maze viewed from above, collecting flags.

The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.\n\nThe aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.","Publisher":"Mastertronic Added Dimension","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"158644":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Scorpio Gamesworld","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"2973f488-f231-44e0-9f73-486481bc1e0d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c19d5026-1064-44c5-876d-ac158453ea0f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4ec45b04-b80f-4d72-b3e7-172c7f8e22ac.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"844a5a38-dfa9-499e-b0ac-39d568f62913.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5c7c859c-814b-4811-8f81-8a47aa087939.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Vampire Killer","Overview":"Vampire Killer is a side-view flick-screen game where you are a Vampire hunter who has been tasked to remove Dracula from the 12th floor of a block of flats by a client on the floor below.

In your rush to get to the building you have forgotten your equipment like garlic and stakes, which is needed to face Dracula. You have to get to the 12th floor using elevators (which have minds of their own and can take you down as well as up), and you must look behind the doors of each flat for equipment to help you.\n\nSome flats are also empty as well as flats that have scares inside you and when scared, you lose part of a shock meter and when it reaches zero then it is game over. Bats and spiders live on various floors with some blocking your route so bullets can be found in the flats to clear the way. Some doors to the flats actually are lift shafts which send you back down to the 1st floor.

Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\n\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\n\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. \n\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\n\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","Publisher":"Audiogenic Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"158662":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"cae69749-b4a6-4c1c-87d8-e8a7d66e47f1.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7e0541b4-4dc5-4b1e-b2c0-768b783bc1ea.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f28d7509-503d-4881-b88e-50bc32605578.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"499738f6-0649-454d-81e1-ccfd25254948.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7e1fbb4b-0515-4fb5-801e-2769f6446aae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6704b88f-419d-47df-8f73-a8cf8d9855ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Lop Ears","Overview":"Lop Ears, the rabbit went out playing, and exploring, on his own. \nUnfortunately he strayed far from his normal territory and became \nlost.

The player controls a famous explorer who while being chased by a band of Nomads finds the entrance to a mythical diamond mine called the Lost Caves.

In each of the game's sixteen levels the aim is to collect all ten diamonds and then escape through a wooden door. To reach all the diamonds it is necessary to dig around boulders so that they collapse and create a path.\n\nDangers include being crushed by falling boulders or being caught by the Nomads that patrol the mines. There are also bombs which explode when dropped or another object is dropped onto them and lava which works the same but will spread around the mine. There are also different wall types: standard walls that can be destroyed with explosives, strong walls which can not be destroyed, disappearing walls which can be activated through a lever and magical walls which can be walked through.

It forsakes the.3D space laser action in favour of a more complicated trading game where success is in staying alive and making money is tougher than borrowing a fiver from the art deépartment.\n\nThe game begins by giving you a choice of three skill levels: difficult., impossible and suicidal get the idea? These aren't far from the truth but fear not. with a bit of experience and know-how it is possible to make profits . After creating the universe in which the game takes place (irs always different) you are put at the controls of the ship in which you'll cruise the galaxies.\nLife begins at a space station but most of your business will be conducted at planets where cargos can he benight and sold. The initial screen is packed with information, the most important of which is the central command, menu which gives you the list of possible actions. At space stations there are two functions that cannot be performed at planets banking and telex. Banking is where you can change your money between cash and credit, (cash is liable to be stolen), while telexing will tell you the whereabouts of Mr Boo. He's a forerunner of yours who went off his trolley and should be avoided at all costs.\n\nMaking a short scan will take you off the flight deck and reveal the three sectors of the galaxy around you. These can contain space stations, planets that look like marbles, space or uncharted territory, the latter being out of bounds for the ship Once a destination is selected and the ship launched the display changes to show a box in which the stars whizz past. On an uninterrupted flight the destination planet will loom into view and the\nship will land - all automatically.\n\nThe flight can be interrupted by two things: pirates and meteor storms. Both can be avoided by evasive action but if fuel is tow the pirates writ have to be fought or the meteors flown through. Fighting takes you to a simple shoot-em -up screen where successive hits are needed to destroy pirates but they also attack your shields and hull and if laser power of full strength reach zero you're dead. Meteors also damage the shields and hull again causing death if they reach zero strength.\n\nThe facilities offered by planets vary and to find out more about them you have to use the short scan. This will give some written details and a series of letter codes that changes each game. These will be continuous throughout a single game and tell you which planets have repair facilities, casinos, hyperdrive units and so on.\n\nThere are many different cargos ranging in price and availability but the obvious aim is to buy low at one planet and sell high at the other Where the best prices are is discovered by experience and keeping an eye out for shortages, civil wars and supply availability\n\nMoney can be spent in many ways on refuelling the ship, repairing it. protection money to pirates, buying extra equipment or in a casino This means there has to be a regular source of income or you'll soon be bankrupt or dead Once the game has ended you're given a rating but don't expect this to improve too quickly - it's a tough game.","Publisher":"Amsoft","ReleaseYear":1986},"158667":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"26f39d27-62b7-45cb-bcc4-997b08458cea.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"221fbc18-02b5-4f20-9da2-8bbb5b0c68ac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"21a56821-d091-4573-9e85-11ed37e59515.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"56caacb9-261a-477c-8e23-7e02ef488100.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"638a48a6-c762-44b4-9eb3-c7dc5d2621b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"70eee176-7832-44a8-bf1b-228492737773.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5b2d62b5-be3a-4545-9a4e-726fac972baf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b1f5e76f-2e0a-4c23-907e-caef7f119848.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Madballs","Overview":"On the planet Orb live a gang of notorious Madballs who decide what is passed through parliament. They have no leader, and this is where a ball simply known as Dust Brain comes in. It is his quest to persuade the other Madballs on the planet to join him in his quest for power, and he does this by bumping them off the multi-directionally scrolling platforms. Once a Madball has been persuaded, it appears in a tube at the bottom of the screen. When a Madball ends up in the tube, Dust Brain must find the 'downtube' exit so that he can pursue other Madballs. \n\nWhile searching for other Madballs, Dust Brain encounters many obstacles that include trampolines, springboards, catapults, ramps, pyramids, and oil slicks; and these obstacles can either help or hinder Dust Brain. Each platform has its own dustbin, and if Dust Brain bounces over this, he changes into a Madball already in the tube. Also, he will make contact with three bureaucrats who will make his task harder, but they can also be pushed of the edge of platforms, giving Dust Brain plenty of time to bounce around before the bureaucrats have the chance to resurrect themselves.\n\nEach Madball has its own speed and strength, and it can be difficult for a strong Madball to fall off a platform. Each of them also have their own energy source, which include cabbages, fish heads, bones, and Coke. When eight Madballs have been persuaded, this tube is full. When the active Madball falls off the platform, another one takes its place. When the last Madball in the tube falls off the platform, his quest for power has failed.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseYear":1988},"158668":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Titus Interactive","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"4b611631-dde6-4ba2-acd5-d9e68ab73617.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fbbc3adf-acd3-4ed7-9f8b-26ce1f63cd9c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f8119b4d-2552-4e78-b649-c8fbfa9f48b0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f3bc387d-cb9e-479c-bbe2-620e57031ab5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ec4ce9df-7efc-4da0-ae26-a48416a0dcae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"565ccbc5-974e-4691-889d-c081449cae87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8f4a84ae-af63-4a97-ae27-b1c46d61232d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Maddog","Overview":"Maddog or what a dog's life!\n\nWill this unruly dog manage to live old in spite of all his fantasies?\n\nThe day, animated by sudden desires, he runs and Gambols joyfully.

The events are:\n\nWheelies Trial: You must pull a wheelie and keep the wheel up for over 45 metres by holding right to lift the wheel and let it go to lower it. If two players are playing then the screen is split into two with both players attempting the event at the same time.\n\nRamp Jumps: Waggling left to right as fast as you can, you must approach a ramp and when on the ramp press fire to kick. You need to clear your friends lying on the ground and reach a distance of 16 meters or more.

Doubles Volleyball is a volleyball game for one or two players that features both indoor and beach courts. The player can choose to play alone against the computer, against another player or cooperate with another player against the computer. All modes involve two players per team and when not cooperating with a friend the player controls both players. When the ball is in play, a small x indicates where it will land and the player has to position himself with his arms aligned to it and then hold down the fire button to set the hardness of the hit. First hit is a bump, second is a set and third is a spike. To succeed with a spike the player has to be at the x spot and release the fire button just when the ball is about to land. While the ball is on the opposite side of the court the active player can be changed. The game can be played in nine difficulty levels divided into three sections: slow, medium and fast. Within each section are different rules for net fouls, ranging from being allowed to being penalised.","Publisher":"Mastertronic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"158691":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pro Boxing Simulator"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"986d0f9e-98e5-43ab-9adf-911b263933bf.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"505f4672-8c53-4f75-ab68-601191615de3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f7653444-8826-4d6f-b6a3-6db982d65923.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9c3b281b-0db2-4a3d-8bdc-82532ebb8159.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6360d4b4-d9de-4301-b9a2-76304d558d34.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6e035b18-93fa-49df-9abd-ec75d42e08d7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"011fb79e-fbb5-49e6-8f29-c638fdbb3695.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"30de9ebe-0180-446d-a1ce-54b28240241b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4b132156-d6ed-494d-a14b-04df757b5663.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0fa63bb5-e3fd-41e2-aa29-1d8cc0192f8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"By Fair Means or Foul","Overview":"On ST and Amiga features a full range of jabs, uppercuts and weaves.

As a service droid it is your job to prevent this, and maximise the output.\n\nAchieving this involves a lot of planning and resource management. There are several buildings at your disposal, containing seeds, solar panels, weaponry, fencing and traps. You must plant the seeds, use the solar panels to maximise their growth, and then harvest the finished product so as to trade it. You can carry a gun to take care of the bugs, but this needs recharging frequently, and the location of the munitions store must be determined.\n\nWhen the bugs break part of the fence, you need to replace it to stop lots more coming through. This can be done more quickly by reducing the compound size, which causes the trade-off loss of growing room.","Publisher":"Bulldog","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"158719":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Jewels of Darkness Trilogy I: Colossal Adventure"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c92b7674-20b8-40a1-a39c-c01a86864323.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"91e2748b-364d-440b-addd-977bf50b42f6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"dd4642ce-dbfa-4859-a113-bb2c78864992.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0a61ac65-75fa-4ae1-b192-dbfd16f895da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b720ab60-559d-43b2-89a2-12803bdc9cf0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Colossal Adventure","Overview":"Colossal Adventure takes its cue from the very earliest mainframe text adventures.

It's a words-and-numbers game show, and the original format of 6 letters games, 2 numbers games and a conundrum, is recreated here. There is no computer opponent, so 2 people are required.\n\nIn the letters round, a selection of 9 letters is formed by alternately choosing a vowel or consonant, and the players have 30 seconds to find the longest available word. Generated letter combinations are not always realistic with the show. As in Computer Scrabble, the full dictionary is not stored in memory, so the game will ask if the words you enter are real. The longest word scores its length, with 18 points for a 9 letter word - both players score for equal length words.\n\nThe numbers game also takes 30 seconds, and involves choosing 6 numbers from a set including 25,50,75 and 100 as well as 2 each from 1-10. Choose how many large numbers you want, and the set is chosen randomly. A three-figure target is randomly generated, and you have 30 seconds to add, subtract, multiply and divide to get as close to it as possible.\n\nThe conundrum finishes the show - it's a 9-letter anagram, which the first player to solve buzzes in to give his answer, scoring 10 points if correct.","Publisher":"TV Games"},"158735":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"128e8523-ab82-4c66-bd29-70507287105f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a8310f1-0944-4367-bcee-abf3f3ce9f8f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8145accd-7267-450b-ba55-c041b02a06f9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a814d113-93d9-45e2-ab19-51ab15653b01.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf3cd9c9-9eef-4b93-8f4f-f11d34a80194.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0e1197f5-3b0e-4513-a8ba-da5dc50c9ead.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cowboy Kidz","Overview":"Cowboy Kidz is a top view vertical scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls constantly upwards as you control a cowboy on a horse shooting bandits to protect a mail-train.

You play John Marsh, a soldier turned leader who must go to Mars and locate the original plans.\n\nMarsport uses the same game system as Tir Na Nog and Dun Darach, although a 3D effect is incorporated into the graphics. A single path is displayed on screen at a time, and the view is rotated at junctions. The Warriors and Warlords must be shot down using weaponry, making this Gargoyle's most action-driven adventure up to this point.\n\nThe Marsport is split into ten distinct sections with their own functions, such as Stores, Administration and Computers. There are robots to interact with, for gaining information or objects. Pairs of objects can be combined to manufacture new ones. A central computer locks out many sections until it can be found and disabled. You will have to shoot the Sept before they can touch you, and also be wary of Warden robots which may malfunction and mistake you for a Sept.","Publisher":"Gargoyle Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"158751":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"84ce8287-4d64-408f-8e61-9623af0016d8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"abbe0081-a4b2-4696-95e0-dc7947d6d9a2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8fc0ef66-f21c-46ab-a432-45c18b4bbbf3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"62b681dc-9316-45d5-ab8e-79b33772acb5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Martianoids","Overview":"After a long journey, robot ship Markon Dawn is attacked by the martianoids aliens which disrupt the passage of programs, destroy active components in the ships brain and drain your battery in attempt to destroy your ship.\n\nYour mission is to defend the Markon brain from the infestation using a defence droid that has to guide programs from a transmitter to a receiver to activate the ships defences.

In addition to the TV series, entitled M.A.S.K., an acronymn for Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, there was also a series of books, authored by Kenneth Harper and illustrated by Bruce Hogarth, and comics. A new line of toys was produced to accompany each TV series.\n\nThe stories all centre around the M.A.S.K. organisation led by the fearless Matt Tracker. M.A.S.K. agents wear helmets or masks to protect their identities and to give them super powers which help in their fight against the criminal V.E.N.O.M. organisation. They drive super powered vehicles which can transform.\nV.E.N.O.M., aka the Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem, are the bad guys. They are by Miles Mayhem one time friend of Matt and co-founder of MASK who betrayed Matt long ago. \n\nThere are four areas to the game and in all Matt must drive his Thunderhawk vehicle around the game area, avoiding V.E.N.O.M.'s armoured vehicles and tanks while accomplishing tasks in a specific order.\nIn area 1 : Boulder Hill, his first task is to recover his own mask and later an abducted agent. However it's not just a case of driving around until the agent is found. Matt must first and collect a scanner which will direct him the missing agent (who will be hidden). However the agent cannot be picked up until his mask has been collected and the scanner will not function until the four pieces of the security key have been collected and assembled. Items, including bombs, are collected by driving over them. Bombs are Matt's only weapon against V.E.N.O.M.'s tanks and, as bombs do, they will damage Matt and his vehicle if he's too close to the explosion.\n\nThe remainder of the game consists of three more areas, Prehistoric, Far Future, and VENOM Base each of which have two abducted agents to rescue.","Publisher":"Gremlin  Graphics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mNss9ztWIfk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/M.A.S.K.#Video_games"},"158753":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Mask II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"5cf571f3-243d-4a43-893e-36685d491e71.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"30920b8e-601b-460b-b297-bbe15c222c7e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9101868d-5958-4fe5-ae08-7976ea1507be.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a98c9b99-7943-4961-84f7-813d094b5ef8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"11c58b14-11db-4dd0-853e-6c980298130a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"36bd5119-ae30-4988-a23a-6ea8bb671b4e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1cd24a65-3e73-4a33-99e3-d00e58f7bae6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6258d37f-4d48-4744-b268-ac0b05bc047d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"55787d45-c52b-40a9-9638-e9504ff9a7c0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"67a1c723-d195-45ba-882e-e8713aa88ab5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"20ce3a43-6f39-40fa-b3bb-7d42c2d7dc43.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"447c7d84-c839-4255-b4b7-7fb032a6bf1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d59830c3-6412-44e9-972a-4b41cae03483.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"MASK Two Two","Overview":"MASK II is a single player side scrolling shoot-em-up and is the second game in the M.A.S.K (Mobile Armored Strike Kommand) series that was based on a TV series \/ comic \/ toy license of the mid 1980's.

To position the pod, your ship will attract the pod when it is nearby, but on higher levels it will be repelled by your ship and with careful manoeuvring, it can be placed in position (P). Once this is done, you must return to the access hatch to be teleported to the next satellite.

When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can only be stopped by shooting them. \n\nWhen you learn of a meeting, you can enter it on foot, either to gain evidence or make an arrest - but remember that a joint full of crooks will not simply allow you to do your civic duty.

The powers-to-be who own the computer feel that it is a waste of time sending in trained engineers to solder broken parts of the circuit when small robots containing a cyber brain can do the job themselves. You have been tasked to train a robot in the shape of a mouse by moving the robot around the circuit manually, repairing broken sections so that it will learn the job in hand. To repair a broken section you must move over one of various red crosses containing solder tracks with a certain shape track appearing below the playing area. If you don't require that shaped track then you move over the cross again until the track you need appears. \n\nOnce happy with the track, you then move to a broken part of the circuit and press fire. You then have to go back to a cross to collect another track to repair another broken part of the circuit. To make the job more interesting, you have placed various droids that move around the circuits and these must be avoided or your mouse loses part of a damage meter and when empty loses one of five lives. Another meter shows how much of the circuit is broken and when a part is repaired then this decreases but certain droids will break the circuit so this will decrease. Once the broken circuit meter is empty before a time limit reaches zero then you can move to the next part of the computer to a new broken circuit.","Publisher":"Mastertronic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"158775":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"573cf572-5a76-4e9b-8069-a391e64ba425.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"eb2c1462-7618-4db3-aa8c-babd0ea7068e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3efa79d1-9584-42de-b7cc-33c2a5d5d5e7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4cc8c046-4b81-48aa-a450-5af180329ac7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f21a2fa5-b078-47c0-b919-2eeeca876179.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e6c760fa-b594-4ff3-82b5-7292b9fe7ecd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3f128dcf-fd66-4d1a-bffb-ba4e08422520.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Microball","Overview":"A pinball game for up to four players.

The manual provides a detailed look at ospreys and their history in Scotland.

You must pick them up and quickly throw them out of the building to safety - failure to do this costs you a droid and a room (occasionally blocking off other essential rooms). The game's levels have grid-like arrangements with doors, trapdoors and poles, and increase in size as the game goes on. For both these reasons, mapping is essential. Security droids are on patrol, but these can be tricked into falling down holes. A computer room is the hub of your activities - this allows you to use teleports and turn off force fields, via the appropriate circuit boards which are hidden throughout the levels. On later levels the gravity isn't constant and you will find rooms with distorted directional senses, increasing the precision required significantly.","Publisher":"Ariolasoft UK","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P0x2bHE-snc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Deactivators"},"158833":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"970a318f-e178-4803-beb0-4690fe268254.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d6eba107-d353-4231-88b3-b14687fee3f4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1b8b47f3-9b12-413b-bdd8-b2841cf6d1af.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c277500b-3ebd-45a5-bbdd-9034826e8b7c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5454e6be-0812-497b-805f-83b10e90e936.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e5a77818-7f38-486b-b82c-df6956bea52c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9951410f-6d09-4987-ac71-8c10b7eea8f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dad29593-6c2a-458f-aa08-3d0f8b350146.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dead On Time","Overview":"Dead on Time is an \"if it moves, shoot it\" game.

The player takes the role of tank commander Lone Wolf who has to foil Rommel's plans in Northern Africa. The strategic part of the game plays on a overhead map which shows Lone Wolf and Rommel's positions. The overall goal is to save the Allied depots which are attacked by Rommel's troops - the main challenge is to save all of them in time. Lone Wolf can be moved over the map and one airstrike per game can be used to buy time for one depot. Lone Wolf also has the ability to gain enemy intel with his radio - this is useful in order to find out where obstacles await.\n\nWhenever Lone Wolf runs into one of these obstacles or Rommel, one of five action sequences starts. This includes tank duels, a turret section against incoming fighters, navigating a minefield, protecting a convoy and escaping an ambush. Those action sequences can also be played separately from the campaign. Lighting conditions change depending on the time of day.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseYear":1986},"158847":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"2e6797a1-d43a-46dc-8d3f-734050fc454b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5e7ce53b-241f-4424-89d1-08dc7c1da3ee.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6aabc334-a904-4f36-ba81-e12c1d1e0a33.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b4a698fa-f92c-4a47-8a94-15cdc49cd21a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"cbf25160-d44d-4823-b1a5-74bce5a18222.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f30c7872-b12b-454c-aceb-9ffd7123d5b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Desert Rats","Overview":"Desert Rats is the second entry in R.

The bitter campaign includes Operations Battleaxe and Crusader and the Battle of Gazala. The game is named after the men of the 7th Armoured Division who were known as the Desert Rats after adopting a 'gerbil' as their insignia. Several versions like DOS and ZX Spectrum 128K includes two additional scenarios: Operation Compass and the Battle of Beda Fomm (December 1940-February 1941).\n\nThe gameplay is shown on a scrolling map by turns. Players select the units and give them orders to hold position, move to, fortify, or assault. Units move on the grid of rectangular cells. The balance of battles may be adjusted by Malta Status (Historical, Operation Hercules, Not used as base) as well. Historically, Montgomery defeated Rommel at El Alamein, and it is player's opportunity to alter the history making it sooner or vice versa.\n\nThe game is accompanied by a detailed instruction booklet including historical background notes of the campaign with maps and photographs.

As you fight your fuel will decrease and any hits from the crafts decreases your shields and if these reach zero or the countdown clock reaches zero then it is game over. Once a wave is destroyed then any planets or generator pieces appear and you can track the locations of these objects and crafts shown on a radar scope which gives a 3D effect of space. \n\nYou can carry two pieces of the generator at a time and these need to be taken to the time continuum hole whose location is shown on the Galactic Map and the actual hole is a grid of nine squares with the squares being removed for every piece placed.

The Knight can teleport around the board at will and will turn a line of squares in front of him into deadly traps.

He ventures into the domain of the Lizard King, where according to legend a large pot of gold awaits bold adventurers. The player controls Dirk through eight distinct scenes:\nYe River Caves: Dirk must go down a wild river in his boat, avoiding rocks by steering in the direction indicated by arrows as well as avoiding deadly whirlpools.\n\nBoulder Alley: Channeling Indiana Jones, Dirk must escape a giant boulder rolling towards him, leaping over holes in the ground and avoiding other obstacles in the way.\n\nThrone Room: Deadly magical traps await in the Lizard King's throne room. Dirk can only survive by using the correct sequence of sidesteps and sword slashes.\n\nDungeons of the Lizard King: Dirk is very close to his goal, but the Lizard King has laid a trap: he stole Dirk's sword, put it near the pot of gold, and now is close on the hero's tail. Dirk must navigate a maze of rooms to find the sword, avoiding the Lizard King who is in hot pursuit. Once found, the sword must be used to strike down the King.\n\nMagical Flying Horse: Riding on a flying horse, Dirk must evade rocks of ice (which sap his strength) and solid walls (which end his journey instantly when hit).\n\nDoom Dungeon: Traps and evil creatures abound in a dungeon room. Again, only the correct sequence of attacks and steps will allow Dirk to survive.\n\nMystic Mosaic: Dirk must cross a room to get to one of two possible exits (only one of which leads to safety), but there's a catch: the floor consists of a magical mosaic, which constantly changes shape in a repeating pattern. Standing in the wrong place at the wrong time means certain death. A giant bat that inhabits the mosaic room can be vanquished with a sword blow.\n\nMud Monsters: The key to final escape is a magic bottle, a long way from the place where Dirk starts this scene. He must find a way across a gap in the canyon and jump across a huge mud-spewing geyser, all while avoiding the mud monsters.","Publisher":"Software Projects","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"158868":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Jewels of Darkness Trilogy III: Dungeon Adventure"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Level 9 Computing","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"620e5b1e-efe0-4eb6-8402-92d8946757db.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7c6ba336-0804-4c4d-87bc-155530462184.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0d6600b3-a301-4055-aa29-3811c027fef8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"97f02f26-e44b-44c6-88da-9d1c8d55df6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"aa8909b0-d8ff-48b6-870b-fc82b7d59f3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dungeon Adventure","Overview":"Dungeon Adventure concludes Level 9's Middle Earth lineage of fantasy interactive fiction games (later reprogrammed with graphics in Jewels of Darkness).

The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. \n\nFour historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.\n\nThe game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be.

The secret of progressing in the game was therefore learning the patterns of the aliens and learning where to place the ship to shoot down the various hordes without getting crushed by the hundreds of dropped bombs or colliding with an alien as it hit the bottom of the screen, where it just wrapped around to reappear at the top.\n\nThe player only has three lives and many players found this game to be extremely difficult if not completely impossible after just a few screens, however, the game is completable.

They take place from behind your plane, which can be controlled with ‘up’ referring to ‘climb’ or ‘dive’, depending on player preference. You are armed with 10 missiles as well as standard weapons. The plane can survive a few hits, so watch the damage report as it goes from red to black. Fail to complete a section in the time limit and you use up a continue, but the amount of planes previously shot down is not reset, making the second attempt easier Chase HQ style. As you destroy enemies you gain access to better planes, and the rank reported at the end of the game improves – this is also dependent on the skill level you play at.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/G-LOC:_Air_Battle"},"158994":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Firebird Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a2e08d48-0f0c-492f-85cb-5abc9eff1b55.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a67c33e8-9d21-433c-95c4-2f5a3ecce0d0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"780f00bf-ab49-4c4a-8900-1ee75232659f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a5a06f0c-3bdb-49a5-bae8-c562d02c31c9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e6297484-10ee-4e3d-9df1-405d86bf18a4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"a242a903-987f-4d1d-af9c-359a174e2633.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fedb4257-cc63-41d7-a50a-0cf76a69e51a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0ddea19f-79d5-4c8b-a2ca-b4a7dbc2d0e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gothik","Overview":"The lands far north of Belorn are ruled by an evil lord with an iron fist . Only the powers of the druid Hasrinaxx would be able to harm the lord, but missing any support by his people, Hasrinaxx has been imprisoned. To ensure he can never be freed, the lord cast a spell on Hasrinaxx, splitting his body into six parts and hiding them in the four towers of the lord's huge castle, each part guarded by a powerful demon.\n\nIn Gothik, the player takes control of a young warrior whose task is to collect all six body parts and reunite them with the druid's robe in order to finally defeat the evil lord.\n\nThe game itself is inspired heavily by the arcade classic Gauntlet. Two different characters are available: Olga can take less damage than Olaf, but her magic powers are greater. Seen from above, the player moves through the castle and must vanquish the lord's minions within the four towers, each consisting of seven levels.\n\nTo defeat the sixteen different types of monster, Olga or Olaf can use arrows (which require ammunition) or magical lightning bolts (which bounce from one enemy to the next) and fireballs (which can destroy barriers and walls in addition to enemies), both requiring magical energy. Health, ammunition and energy can be refilled by picking up food, quivers and magic chalices, respectively.\n\nOther pick-ups include gold, extra lives, and 32 different types of potions, which may have positive or negative effects. Also available are magic relics, which can make the player invisible, mimic a certain type of monster, as well as temporarily freeze or even kill enemies nearby. All of the relics must be specifically activated, drawing magical energy when in use.","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QGaMk0Eh7Bw"},"158995":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Michael McLean","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"77218e2d-ad9e-447e-b89a-ad5d76a379f1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10ae19e2-e551-4aee-92c5-b936b21d99ba.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4cc13302-1b0b-4214-88b9-52bf97148517.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fe50a484-15ec-4c1e-9bc3-49e7940b8752.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"231a0f01-8873-4ec0-a1fb-b40dca1afcab.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"32df779f-3749-4463-ad01-f86828b09883.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c7b82c69-fd09-402a-b73a-5a388c6d016a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Graham Gooch's Test Cricket","Overview":"Time to get your bat and pads, put on the whites and have a game of cricket.

Gonch has had his Walkman confiscated at school, because he was listening to it during lessons, which was then stolen from the staffroom.

High priority conditions are checked before the player can input any commands. Their uses include checking whether the player is still alive, or letting certain non-interactive events happen (upon entering a room, for example). Local priority conditions are checked after player input and deal with things local to a particular room e.g. whether certain objects are in that room. Low priority conditions work similar to local priority conditions with the difference that they are not confined to individual rooms, and check ,for example, which objects you are carrying.\n\nThe parser features it-detection and understands multiple commands per line (e.g. take box and open it).\n\nTo make creating games a little easier, GAC includes a quick start file with many preset verbs and messages like \"take\", \"look\", \"What now?\", \"Pardon?\" etc., that are commonly used in adventures.

To help on your mission, Roderick Hero has several useful types of equipment. A prop pack will allow you to hover and fly around the mineshaft and (hopefully) avoid the many dangers within. Your helmet features a short range microlaser beam which can be used to destroy the bats, spiders, snakes, and other creatures you'll encounter in the mines. From time to time, your path through the mine may be blocked by stone or lava walls. You begin each mission with six sticks of dynamite which can be used to destroy these obstacles (be careful you don't blow yourself up, though!). If you run out of dynamite, your laser beam can also be used to destroy the walls, though this will take longer and use up more energy. As the levels progress, the mine shaft will become longer and more maze-like, creatures will more frequently block the path, and lava walls and pools will appear which are dangerous to the touch.\n\nThe Amstrad version is an unofficial fanmade conversion made by Philippe Widmer in 2005.","Publisher":"Public Domain\/Freeware","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2005,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yonmzs5OzH4"},"159019":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Activision","Images":[{"FileName":"e74cd63d-c59a-4bab-881c-bf420408121a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"883aa6bc-5beb-4cfa-88aa-13b42994faf7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"21bffb1d-5ba2-4ffd-b0af-370747aa96ac.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cf8630af-465e-4f45-8ee9-7b519b3b8533.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"56288693-8626-47cd-8145-6af918fcc979.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4303fc75-e370-4d15-9aa2-c87a24397b4d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"97a9f87d-3c90-414b-af63-b2b7eec31b50.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e927b42b-7c12-413d-b8bc-8ad14a57423e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a80af87-6a90-4685-a88c-195210bd76cd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aae1b698-b99b-4e52-bddf-59b3ed23501c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a9bbec5-feb4-4cee-9e5b-821e62be1f21.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7ea3082-88ea-45a3-ac59-37d94ccf65b2.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f00dee73-3eb5-4c08-9bb5-37c870cba293.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"74f8a86a-58e5-41fb-afc3-9cd57e4f11ec.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c04ca40-50e6-4abb-b767-9e1b413285ea.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6b9e79e5-9d13-445f-8482-7a6a2ce0ac02.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Hacker","Overview":"Hacker is an adventure\/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.\n\nOnce in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI.

It is the sequel to Hacker. Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the \"Actisource\" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden. In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

It is.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159021":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"a456b5d6-e3e5-4585-8465-47861e4a6512.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"bd292c50-1a5b-4bdb-8a9e-b58f6b777b91.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"96863636-d603-4148-b6ce-b3101f814f02.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"08301d26-612b-480f-b01a-ccbac3ab2bf5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8e2d4654-7041-4eac-babf-e8b4158130a4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5c3ae1ef-2ddd-414e-9a2a-df6abf3a17ef.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"37921730-ad33-4f02-a87f-cdc2249b18ec.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"77df8b65-7f03-45a7-8747-2e32cc5d04f1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04d3665b-a9d9-49e0-9add-6aaa60fdcb0a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"34c74851-f0c7-42c3-b627-7c18bd4b4716.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e7ab0743-3884-47ca-a86d-072c22105868.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"11493eb6-4d28-4a7b-865f-c5c7d3c396fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c66ba752-b220-4d9f-9ce1-368552675dd7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Hammerfist","Overview":"In a grim future, the people are kept under control by a horde of genetically-modified beings who look identical to everyone else, and appear to act the same, but are subtly controlling minds and actions.

The game's influences draw heavily from the occult, with the Master Therion in the plot below a reference to Aleister Crowley. To finish the game, the player must invoke numerous demons who are based on their \"real\" counterparts, e.g. Belezbar is based on Beelzebub. The player controls the neophyte wizard Axil the Able and must help him escape from the dungeons below the castle of Colloden's Pile. This a keyboard-only game, and uses a set of commands (called \"Merphish\" in-game) such as the standard north, south, east and west (N,S,E,W) and some additional unique commands such as invoke (I), freeze (f), and blast (b). Conversations with certain friendly characters such as Apex the Ogre are initiated in the following syntax: \"[character],[speech]\" e.g. \"Apex, thanks\". The dungeons are full of dangerous and hostile creatures such as wyverns, goblins and vampires. Axil can defend himself using magic to stall or kill these creatures.[2] Not everyone in the dungeon is an enemy, some inhabitants (such as Apex the Ogre) are friendly unless provoked and can be conversed with. The dungeon itself is separated into several distinct levels which Axil can travel to and from at will provided he can find the staircases up or down.","Publisher":"Gargoyle Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159030":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Melvyn Wright","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"18a7b145-ad6f-4b88-9daf-6239b5ecd6bc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0d99ed23-d000-4f45-8f95-7c4afd36f5f9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1cd7fea9-9418-4f7e-bcf0-47c56c5e4d1a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"95116a7d-6578-4f2c-a78c-1470681ef378.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c28a9d9d-00ab-41e3-a99f-e3d49548671b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"279f9f2f-be6b-443c-abf6-f7fdc2e7cb51.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"70590939-3d0c-4e16-9f42-0e8da6ee53b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a536641c-6858-4052-9118-a1d548809dea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"336741b0-105e-4cbc-9449-a82119928ad3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Helichopper","Overview":"Your people's clones are trapped behind an electric fence on each of the 23 levels of this action game.

You have three potential ways to foil them – get enough money to bribe them, use political influence to over-rule them, or bring in military force. To achieve any of these tasks, you will need to work with the President, FBI and CIA agents, Military and Political Advisers, and other staff including the Secretary to keep you in contact with them. You have a time limit, which the President can attempt to extend with the hijackers if you request this. You control your characters left-right movement through the buildings directly, including entering lifts to switch rooms, but moving the controller up or down moves a cursor along rows of icons at the top and bottom of the screen. The screen also has graphs to indicate your current political, military and financial situations. Most important of these are the chances to interact with other staff members, provided they are in the room. There are at least two requests you can make to each of them – The President can be asked for more support, an FBI Agent can question staff to ensure that there is no inside information. CIA Agents can give information about the hijackers, with 3 levels of detail, the more advanced ones taking longer. Press releases must be issued to ensure good publicity (and thus keep the President on your side) and funds raised to help with a financial solution. Your final target is to go to the scene of the hijack and negotiate with the terrorists.

The player's mission is to kill the queen by entering the hive with a special vehicle representing a grasshopper. The basic goal of each level is to find the exit which is is made more difficult by the maze-like structure of the tunnels. Three markers can be dropped at will as waypoints.\n\nOf course the player also faces opposition from various enemies and obstacles which can be either shot or dodged by ducking respectively jumping. There are also various items to find which are stored in an inventory until used, e.g. shields, enemy freeze or a grabber to reach objects from a distance. The grasshopper uses up energy which is either taken from pylons or the life force. Obviously the latter is not desirable because reaching zero life force results in death - so the player needs to find pylons inside the hive. When having two pylons, the life force automatically recharges. Two specialities of the game are the vector graphics and a password which is constantly updated and always on screen.","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"159042":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"9d449c16-02f1-46d7-b641-0616fc4e5345.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"39593d7a-40f1-4cb1-a246-5d1d12ffe774.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7656b544-09cb-4d63-a3f8-ba33b21c80b0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0ea1a294-1e29-47ac-ab18-d06f33002888.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c43da825-c8fd-46d3-8e9a-3ec43d7b3828.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9c10d92f-10a9-4685-a52a-17eece6308b1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"1835cb0b-66b5-4f60-8305-11e3e9283818.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ef1cfa74-24c7-4d1a-888f-cf4824aa250a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Hobgoblin","Overview":"Zanock, the only son of the king of Altoris, must cross the swamps of the hobgoblins to bring back the stolen Golden Orb, which has thus far kept the kingdom of Altoris safe.

The gameplay is shoot 'em up based, with the 16 levels scrolling vertically. They are full of hazards ranging from step-like sequences of blocks and metallic edges, to Terry Ball's unleashed devices including microwave ovens and crabs. The initial weapons is quite puny, but collecting discs allows upgrades to be obtained, including multi-directional fire and turbo boosts. You have four lives, but must complete each level within a time limit. It was also one of the first games to feature a wide range of power-ups (via power discs).

Ten-Pin Bowling, Air Hockey (not on the Commodore 16), Darts and Ping Pong (not on the European Commodore 64 releases) are featured. The menus and options screens have the same feel as Clubhouse Sports. Each game has computer opponents at multiple skill levels plus human-versus-human and demo modes, and matches can consist of varying numbers of rounds, with other options depending on the game. Ten-pin bowling is played from a side-on view, although once the shot has been taken you see the results unfold from the bowler's view. There are three stages to taking a shot. Move the player up and down to line up his run-up, pressing fire to set the position. Then, do the same to set the angle of the shot. Finally, after pressing fire to start the run-up, press it again to time the release of the ball, as close to the line as possible. Darts has 4 skill and 3 speed levels, and players can play to 301, 501 or 701, to vary game length or provide a handicapping system. You can also set whether scoring must start or end with a double. Viewed from behind the board, you must first line up the dart, then set the dart's curvature and power by stopping a curved gauge on the right, then a rising power bar on the left. The view then changes twice - first a behind-the-player view to show the dart's approach, then a close-up of the board to show where it landed. Air Hockey plays for five minutes, or until someone has scored 12 points. The view is above the pitch but angled so as to emphasize the goal at the top. Ping-Pong features a handicapping system - six ability areas can be graded from 1-5, to ensure a closely-matched game. Again the view is from behind one court. To impart direction onto a shot, the angle must be pressed at the same time as the fire button. Superstar Ping-Pong is included on the Disk version.","Publisher":"Databyte","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"159069":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"be4a3707-585b-4638-b45b-a7f773f98144.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c5f70846-3bfe-4af8-9f13-02095a42004d.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fc76ad80-8843-4266-9112-48983bd1f7db.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1de018e1-f4af-4102-adc8-376d684cea3c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"48cf2538-5bf8-4fb7-82ff-9988621920aa.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3b46c883-a6c5-43c1-bd60-a81d179b060b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3f984f03-d81b-4388-8628-2d38515ed4fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Infiltrator","Overview":"You as Johnny McGibbitts, ace pilot and neurosurgeon has given a mission against the \"Mad Leader\".

Many arcade games of the period would have a hard time with the transition, lacking enough of a skeleton of plot to flesh out with characters and events, but the Hunchback franchise has always enjoyed descent from one of the greatest works of French fiction (not incidentally long since in the public domain, hence ripe for free squeezing), Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris... even if it hadn't made terribly extensive use of its heritage up to this title. You are still Quasimodo, deformed ward of the Church, and you still quest for the favour and well-being of gypsy Esperalda, but for once you don't do so by jumping over pits and ducking under arrows (and, uh, participating in organised sporting events)! Instead, you navigate sites in, around and under Paris, including the Cathedral of Notre Dame, collecting inventory items to use to solve puzzles and overcome minions of the Bishop and Cardinal -- foes who no longer cause you to lose a life at the merest contact. The narrative does sustain a bit of garbling along the way in the transition from high literature to action arcade game and back to crypto-literary interactive fiction, but they take what they've learned about design along the way and present things clearly, possessions and companions continually visually indicated above a baroque text input\/output field. The interface is as intuitive as those of the prior games in the franchise, despite the enormous gulf between their respective styles of gameplay. Now you can give your twitchy fingers a rest and let your brain take over for a while.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159076":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"42664db8-fb27-4d48-982e-a697faa510ce.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"94209f74-0b03-4d06-8b97-5d09a5e3ad77.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"21ad75dd-da2b-4b9c-a69b-3ee401a91a05.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e43cb3fb-c159-43b1-a832-1fb01a685b64.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fdff2783-e442-497e-9cd6-0fc8b79a0ec5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4f300eae-f4cb-4e4c-938d-e80f5f6744f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Hunt for Red October","Overview":"The Hunt for Red October is a video game based on the book The Hunt for Red October.

This game will test you to see if you're really up to the job. You play a park ranger, whose job is to collect twelve items scattered around the park, such as soda cans, bottles, and balls. Unfortunately, getting these items is not as easy as it sounds, as your task gets difficult by swimmers, swamps, snakes, turtles, and ants. To make matters worse, your energy gets depleted quickly, so to restore it, you can either return to your hut, or snatch food off an ant's back in later levels. More often than not, some of the turtles will follow you into the lake. If they enter the lake, you can run them over for 500 points before they decide to jump back out again.\n\nBesides collecting items, you also must rescue swimmers that are about to drown in the lake. Fail to rescue a swimmer in a limited amount of time, and you'll also drown, and the same can be said if you bump into snakes. Rather than collecting items, you can also roll on logs. Doing this will earn you 5000 points if you manage to roll for a long time. There are five levels of Park Patrol to complete, and once you complete all of them, the diffculty level gets higher and the game becomes much more difficult. To give you an example, the turtles will stop at nothing to kill you, and there will be more than one swimmer to rescue at once.\n\nThis game can have two players. Park Patrol even provides you with a menu, in which you can alter the number of turtles, ants, swamps, swimmers, and snakes in each of the five levels. With the menu, you can have none of these in every level, but what's the fun of completing a level without any enemies to avoid? Also, you can play as a boy or a girl.","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159084":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3fa3b759-f7e4-4f4b-b5a9-05a3fcbfd91b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e29d4939-5173-4f8b-a95a-f8ca99d8f58e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6f6bcd2c-4cc2-44b8-855a-5693f0f2863a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6cb8943d-a95d-45ae-a199-772b441b4a43.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"73a3b0cc-fb51-4ed8-9e84-37000968700f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"08669f7f-6c60-4a33-94c7-497deaadd4aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Passing Shot","Overview":"This is a conversion of the SEGA coin-op game of the same name, playing lawn tennis around the world.

Other than that, you have nine lives.","Publisher":"Artic Computing","ReleaseYear":1985},"159086":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"9e07426f-e3df-4f32-b804-4af6cbbb9cf0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b432ebd1-0b50-44a3-a995-a01f3bae9433.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"2bc075d2-efb0-4ab7-92c4-32e6d7f92f76.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b16257f5-f672-45c9-a861-081a152efc2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b60d9230-8662-4db0-8ae9-8426b4264955.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"233ab2c6-e668-4d89-ad97-a591a9a04b3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Pegasus Bridge","Overview":"Few hours before the Allied forces hit the beaches on D-Day (6 June 1944), an element of the British 6th Airborne Division made a night landing using gliders and parachutes, initiating Operation Deadstick.

The TV show had two couples playing against each other but this version is for either one (against the computer) or two players. The game was split into two parts, a question and then playing High\/Low with cards. One player is asked a question about how many out of 100 people gave a specific answer, then the other player would say if the actual answer was higher and lower. If the 2nd player was wrong then the other player would then play with the cards first, and vice versa. \n\nEach player has five cards with the first card showing a value and the first player would say if the next card was Higher or Lower with Ace as a high card and the same value would mean a loss. The player also could change the first card or freeze their go to answer a new question so that they can change the card on their next go. If the player gets the next card wrong then the next player has a go with their cards. If the player gets it wrong then a question is asked again but if they reach the other end of the cards correctly then they get a point and a new question. Once a player receives two points then they play the final board.\n\nThe final board has three rows of cards with the bottom row having four with one showing its value, middle row having three and the top row having one. The player has 200 points and they then decide how many points (minimum of 50) to bet on guessing if the next card is Higher or Lower. If they are correct then they get the points back plus the same amount of points. The first card can be changed as well. The player tries to guess the last card with as many points as they can but if they reach zero points during the game then it is game over.","Publisher":"Britannia Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159151":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"e7a16510-d9df-4fc4-9d8c-814210b5e2cf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7c87df20-0473-4d27-8e8e-45eddf4c92b7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"88ec2da2-7c7d-4386-89d5-be8f0079d310.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7b0b16d1-1c50-4400-aa3d-1cf010b9c579.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"20d3919d-abf8-416b-a730-2c474395d9dc.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e907eb9f-2b1f-43df-b9c7-f31fa93441f6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7122d856-2951-447f-863d-880ac94cda04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f1967e4a-7721-4bf5-b3b2-1602462ebcbb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pneumatic Hammers","Overview":"You are Red O'Blair and you have arrived at the Lee Valley Gold Research Base to stop it being destroyed from a rockslide.

This package is aimed at young teens with the inlay card containing words like 'Here's your chance to find out what it's like in those smoke-filled haunts of adulthood'. All the games are two player games of the 'hot seat' variety - with the exception of Table Football where both players have their own action keys The games can be played either as a 'Full Pub Games Run' - which takes the player(s) through all the games and will take around two hours to complete, or a practice mode which allows the player(s) to select and games in any order.\n\nScoring in each game is self explanatory but in the 'Full Pub Games Run' players win £1 per game so the winner at the end of the run is the one with the most money.\n\nThe games are split on both sides of the cassette Side 1 - Menu, Darts, Bar Billiards, and Dominoes Side 2 - Table Football, Pontoon, Poker, and Skittles\n\nThe Menu.\nYou must go through this at the start of the game to enter the players names and choose which mode is being used, 'full run' or practice mode. \n\nDarts\nThis is played as the best of three games starting at either 501 or 301 and finishing on a double. In the pub run the winner of each game gets £1. There's a choice of colours for the dart board. Predefined keys are used to position the cursor over the board to make the shot, however the cursor does not stay in one place, it circles erratically, so the skill is in pressing the 'fire' key as it passes over the desired target. Every dart will hit the board though it is possible not to score by either missing the scoring segments or hitting the wire. When a shot is made there's a little animation on the left of the screen showing a man throwing a dart. No option for lady players though. \n\nBar Billiards\nThis game is played with eight balls (7 white and one red). The object is to pot any ball down any of the nine holes in the table. The red ball starts on the table and any score made with it in any break is doubled. Any foul shot, a ball returning to baulk, failing to hit another ball in play, or knocking down a skittle, ends and zero's the break. As in the 'real' game, for the first ten minutes balls potted are returned. After that the balls are not returned and the game continues until all balls have been potted. An on-screen timer is provided. To play this game predefined keys are used to position the cue ball, and the cue, and to set the power of the shot. Only one game is played in the 'pub run' and the winner gets £1.\n\nDominoes\nBoth players are dealt a set of dominoes. These are displayed face down so that they cannot be seen. As each player takes their turn they reveal their remaining dominoes, select one, and position it on the board using predefined keys. This is played as the best of three games and the winner of each game gets £1. \n\nTable Football\nThis is the only game that requires two players to use the keyboard at the same time. This isn't really a pub game, this is the game that's in fun-fairs, arcades, student common rooms and the break room of some enlightened work places around the world. It's the game with players on metal rods that slide and twist to block and shoot the ball past a keeper into a net. Players have one key each action up\/down\/back\/kick but they have three lines of 'men' to maneuver. The game gets round this by only applying the action key to the line of men nearest to the ball. Once the ball is kicked it keeps on moving until it is either kicked again or a goal is scored. No getting stuck in the corners here! In the 'Pub Run' this game is played as 'best of three' games with nine balls per game and the winner of each game gets £1, the practice mode is best of three games. \n\nPontoon\nOtherwise known as Blackjack. Each player starts with a £10 stake and you can bet between £1 and £5 per hand.Bets are placed and after the second card is dealt players can twist, stick or buy. No sticking is allowed below 16. The game is played as ten consecutive hands for each player and in the 'Pub Run, the final kitty is added to your score, so this is one game where one player can leap ahead of their opponent.\n\nPoker\nHere the player is again given a £10 stake and is dealt a series of ten consecutive hands. Players do not compete against each other, they gamble on the hand they can make. The game pays out 2-1 for a pair, 4-1 for 2 pairs, 6-1 for a flush, 8-1 for a prial (three of a kind), 10-1 for a run, full house, or four of a kind, and 20-1 for a running flush. Again in the 'Pub Run, the final kitty is added to your score which means a good win here with a high value hand could be all a player needs to win the match. For each hand of cards dealt the player chooses which cards to reject. The entire hand can be re-dealt if necessary.\n\nSkittles\nIn the 'pub run' this is played as the best of five games with ten balls per game. Players get £1 per win or per draw The practice game is played as five games with two balls per player per game. A lane is drawn on screen and six skittles are set at the end of it. The ball to be bowled moves back and forth at the end of the lane 'nearest' to the player. A target moves back and forth at the end of the lane behind the skittles - but at a different speed. When the two are positioned to give the perfect bowling line the player hits a key, launches the ball and watches the results. It's very hard not to hit something, and equally hard to knock them all down. Each player bowls all their balls consecutively. Ten points are awarded per skittle knocked down. All skittles are reset for each ball bowled."},"159166":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pub Trivia"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c7a70714-573f-4e00-a483-14a165c05bb4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b7ccd456-a000-437f-8fa0-bae5888f00ae.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c9d3298f-c8e3-42bc-a1e0-22ad2bd833a4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"84bc1c8c-f35c-40ff-8a6f-d590d5b2aff0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"efdb75f5-0153-46f9-b02c-0d55624aa020.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c4475af3-f9ee-4889-9d9e-8d8be1716fbd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bc48f47b-321d-42b7-92fb-4cdf8ae80b6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"96585206-acfb-40fb-bff4-526d32a1fedb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pub Trivia Simulator","Overview":"Pub Trivia Simulator is a game that attempts to simulate an Arcade Quiz Machine found in public houses.

When you have selected your question you then move to a new screen and press the start button. The question appears with the choice of three answers and you must answer before a timer reaches zero and if you get it correct you receive points and move back to the pyramid screen. You pick a new question on a new row and one that is touching the square you last answered. If you get it wrong and you are on the bottom row of the first pyramid you can try again but get it wrong at any other time and it is game over. The next player if selected now plays and if you have any money then you can play again after the other players turns.\n\nIf you reach the top of the pyramid and answer the question correctly then you move to the money maze. This is another pyramid similar to the first one but now has money hidden on certain squares. If you answer a question correctly with money then it is added to the bank and allows you to carry on if you get any questions wrong. Once all players have finished then the points collected during the game goes towards a high score.","Publisher":"Codemasters","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"159167":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"016c51bd-6bdc-464c-9257-bbbe704e55fe.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"99f969aa-2b17-46e2-8fce-912285bd5a54.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d67cf405-de1e-42fb-a4bd-1203c3bf02ca.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b7c9e95b-12f0-405c-824f-4215c1f73aef.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"09baa842-cd2a-4d9b-9e35-9aac6d047169.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fbf05d91-198a-4557-b1bf-7368ddb18ca0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pulsator","Overview":"Five pulsies were trapped in a maze (49 screens each) and the player, as a pulsator, has to rescue them.

There, using the power of the Jewel of the Seven Planets, he intends to wreak havoc on the universe. The player takes on the role of a crusader and, armed only with a sword and a shield, must destroy the Jewel to put an end to Rasputin's schemes. To reach the Jewel the player must first enter the netherworld and neutralise the eight magic spells that Rasputin has cast to protect it. \n\nRasputin: The Crusader's Quest is a single-player \"search the dungeons to find the jewel\" type of game. The netherworld takes the form of a court-yard from which doors take the player to different dimensions. Within each dimension there are magic stones that the player must step on to absorb their magic power and turn them from the dark side to the light. When, finally, the player has absorbed all the runes in a dimension, Rasputin will release a bigger and more dangerous monster from the dark side which, when slain, will give up a rune that will counteract one of the eight magic spells.There are also four rune stones to collect and these give protection when they attempt to neutralise the magic spells, except that the runes are colour coded and the player must have the right rune for the spell that's being broken. In addition there are all sorts of traps, pitfalls and nasty netherworld creatures that will either try to kill or sap the players energy. \n\nThe game can be played with either a keyboard or a joystick. There is no difficulty setting and no keyboard re-definition. There are only six action keys. Left \/ right rotates the character who can either walk or jump forward. There are two keys for fighting, one to use the shield and one to use the sword. Using either of these uses up their energy, indicated by a dual power bar in the lower right of the screen. \n\nThe game world consists of a series of rooms which may or may not have anything useful in them. The player has to work out how to cross the room in order to progress in the game. Items to collected are usually guarded by denizens of the netherworld who the player must either fight or creep past. Failing or dying in this game does not mean that the whole game has to be replayed. The game re-animates the player at the start of that section, doorway of the room to replay that section again. However, each reanimation consumes some of the players life force and when that's gone the game has to be reloaded.","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released"},"159236":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Raid!!!","Region":"France"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3d83822a-f1ec-461c-a70c-fdb340657b3d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea7c1653-bc8e-4fbe-a5a8-9d112218c6f6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2e193605-1140-4280-af21-f53e2ac894fb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9dff47b7-7a86-4eca-b2e4-ea44c308c72b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ef579277-24e8-4cd7-9a17-bfcad1e31e12.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6be65572-1e57-4595-bfbc-d7d29e6f521f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ca7548be-9a64-4fb5-b4ce-e48bc6290711.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"82f58cee-7fa8-4b29-acb3-dfad24a99de4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d5af686c-e243-45cb-913e-b7fb58f749df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Raid Over Moscow","Overview":"The USSR has launched a huge attack on the USA, and the only hope for the free world is for you (as leader of a US Squadron of fighters) to destroy their defense bases.

You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. \n\nThe game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, grant you access to bonus levels, or cause you to lose control of Danko for a few seconds.\n\nOne peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"159245":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Battle Droids","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ariolasoft UK","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"a9afad57-a8ac-4fcc-8cf5-d97f21edd01f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6bc006f6-a2ae-4996-a786-68a65a7e6b33.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e711414c-d645-4f4d-8810-307539f515c8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5e7c38bf-25f2-40af-ae7a-95d8f5f08f90.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"78dba5e5-0f1a-4a7b-b78f-42c220bde39c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9e77b132-7d33-4827-a0c6-6e765c0f6b84.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ae906d94-0f8e-4da5-952b-8fb2910dfdce.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6782ae63-04b0-46b9-8b40-d7745e8e7847.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"85421d52-bf94-457b-8ca1-4faa9eb873ae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"3db7d00f-213b-46b5-be79-9bc58c62d447.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8bf80d3b-db05-434d-8e78-a85a331562f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"07f8e9de-557c-4d87-8d69-5bb633fc4b72.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Red L.E.D.","Overview":"Earth's resources are running out so we need a new power source.

The player controls a jumping ball in eight isometric levels and has to solve four (randomly distributed) puzzles in each. The principle is easy: There are two red blocks which belong together: touching one causes it to glow for a few seconds and during this time the other one has to touched, too. They may be in different height positions or move and the puzzle is to work out how to reach both in time. \n\nThis is made more complicated by roaming enemies, which have to be avoided, and different grounds which may cause acceleration or breaking. The player can change how much energy the ball uses for jumping; this directly influences the height and bounce energy. Directions can't be changed mid-flight. The player is given 5 lives and must also contend with a time limit which becomes progressively shorter as each level is conquered."},"159252":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"eff74786-2d3b-4656-a499-cac25f55aa9b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"538a4a43-762a-4e54-a965-e4843cc789dd.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"948a2ffb-b267-407c-b299-96b5a35d0a31.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fcbde78e-6c5d-46e0-aeba-4033d7b7cc0b.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"f074a60f-623e-4a56-ac61-f98d10a0e12e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6e0fe90e-27a2-4c9e-9d5c-eaef42cf23e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rex","Overview":"Rex the dinosaur is fed up of the environmental damage being done by a nearby nuclear plant.

The player character starts on the upper-most level and slowly makes his way downwards.\n\nThe game uses ASCII characters to represent locations, items, monsters, and the protagonist himself. There are twenty-six different types of monsters, symbolized by their initial letters (e.g. L for Leprechaun). Monsters have different abilities and modes of attack. The dungeon and the items in it are randomly generated each time the player begins a new game. Each dungeon level contains a grid of three by three rooms and dead ends. \n\nLevels get progressively more complex and maze-like, and monsters grow in strength the deeper the hero ventures into the dungeon. The player character can acquire better weapons and armor, gain experience points and level up. Should the protagonist perish in the dungeon, the player must restart the game anew.","Publisher":"Mastertronic Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"159411":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"cfe18150-ef06-4741-8077-8eeec84640e2.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"39a0be8d-e5b6-4c59-8ab9-8fa4b5b250e8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3ec44ecc-b7cb-4f80-b4d6-b23a00e83ead.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ca1cd427-ac40-443d-a0f6-e09973b5c372.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46a5b86c-3a31-4313-b3cf-39631c70c235.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f5af5fef-2b23-4d18-907f-608f661bdfe3.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bd1e241a-34e3-458e-85df-1d82bf7fe6c1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"56e59703-d432-468d-b5c6-137c0ca7b72a.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7fc23fff-9407-4f23-b3a9-e26feee7dc50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"759ca008-dedc-4efa-bec5-a92e043705c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rogue Trooper","Overview":"On the planet Nu-Earth, the perpetual war between the Norts and the Southers has left the entire world a wasteland. The Southers have developed a new weapon: Genetic Infantrymen (G.I.s), designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions. On their first mission, however, they are betrayed: the Quartz Zone Massacre leaves only one of them alive. The surviving G.I. goes AWOL, bent on a mission: to prove that there was a betrayal and to bring the traitor to justice. Helping him are three of his former comrades, who survived as biochips: Helm, Gunnar and Bagman.\n\nIn the first game based on the popular 2000 AD comic strip, the player controls the Rogue Trooper on his mission to find eight vid-tapes which have withstood the destruction and can prove the traitor's involvement. The tapes are scattered over various screens depicting Nu-Earth. Rogue can dispatch Nort soldiers patrolling the area with his gun, while taking care he doesn't get hit too often himself. Nort bunkers also await, being tougher targets than simple soldiers. Supplies in the form of ammunition packs and first aid kits must be found if the need arises. And while Rogue's genetic makeup makes him very tough, he is not invincible: traversing certain types of terrain drains his health automatically.\n\nAbove the main game window, the screen shows the battle computer, consisting of a map of the surroundings and Rogue's vital statistics and inventory. Another part of the screen is reserved for Rogue's biochip buddies, displaying any comments and remarks they might have on the current situation.","Publisher":"Piranha","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159412":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"10e49258-aa7a-4c10-99f1-2a94bd3af125.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0d71c5ab-27ca-43ae-9488-a2182312adf0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d182406d-5480-4ca2-8009-577b98aaba40.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"57aa397f-2669-4842-9e93-1b6d204213e2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"09396f47-6260-421d-bfab-4b2e644827a6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a7858abb-218f-4dc2-91a5-edcf9cf66ade.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ed3819cd-73c3-4d00-bf50-f12d5c6436f2.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4bce6897-a2bd-4a27-829f-b985261bb933.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9f6c5cf3-354b-45af-be71-3b02a61cd584.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Roland Ahoy!","Overview":"Roland Ahoy! allows player navigating a pirate ship on a map of the ocean in order to reach the Golden Harbour and the Treasure Cave, while avoiding the sea monster and other numerous deadly obstacles, such as mines, spiders or fire balls.

Once complete, this weapon will allow Roland to defeat the evil Maestro and save the universe. The game is a direct sequel to Roland in Time and has similar game-play and mechanics.\n\nThe player can choose which of the seven worlds they wish to explore from the planet screen. Roland then appears from out of his phone-box like space-ship on the selected planet and can start collecting weapon pieces, represented by flickering blue orbs. Roland can move around the screen using left, right and jump keys. Other keys allow you to scroll the screen independently of moving the character. The landscape is odd in that some of it allows Roland to walk and jump through it and prevents him falling. Some other areas will collapse under him as soon as he walks on it, and there are even invisible semi-solid areas that slow Roland's rate of fall, but will allow him to gain height by continually jumping.\n\nRoland starts the game with nine regenerations, but these will easily be lost to fast moving enemies, inconveniently placed traps and falls from reasonable heights. Once all of the weapon fragments on a planet have been collected, the screen flashes. At any time, Roland can return to his phone-box and so back to the planet screen. The collected weapon parts do not re-spawn when the planet is visited again, but the rest of the level does refresh.","Publisher":"Amsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nUM2bZGvf8k","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roland_(game_character)"},"159416":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Indescomp","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"dfe83054-280a-4355-a20c-a620eabdc193.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7138d1a3-0078-4d38-be75-64a3d9f39eb7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"30031b98-d8ab-4a94-9976-d4c5467447e1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"53a3e63d-a0cf-4d77-9329-8e0b32033c95.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"7fd26e32-57af-4c2f-a0f2-d4487ee97228.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1ee9af83-df42-4033-8fac-d723766fed77.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d047b69a-7a21-469b-a482-2c703e745439.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"992dd381-2c2d-4117-ae8a-3e30e2834c03.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8d63cca2-f6b4-4b42-b338-00944dd71024.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0ef43c8e-3b0f-40e7-8d44-9a592a010344.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"145faf79-eac9-41d4-8d5c-ea4245eb7212.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"07873742-d76a-4aea-82a2-1fbeeda8c42d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Roland on the Ropes","Overview":"You are Roland, an intrepid archaeologist, interested in visiting the pyramid of Tootiecarmoon looking for a new experience, and in search of treasures and great adventures.\n\nThe game consists of 6 levels, on which you must obtain treasures and - of course - a map that allows you to leave the labyrinthine pyramid alive.\n\nYou must avoid dangerous acid drops, mummies, spiders, vampires, etc. In order to defend yourself from those disagreeable enemies you have at your disposition a gun (with limited bullets), but some enemies are immune to guns, and you must jump or avoid them.","Publisher":"Amsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N6bJnZkNSQ8"},"159417":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Egypt","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"20b892c7-ee5a-4e08-ae3e-001cc3ab407e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a4fb88b5-08ea-4c32-ab82-f8c4fc2b9f3c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b27a8ebe-338b-4ca9-a6e2-ae3769efd93d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"223f2f05-92f5-4be4-9247-74e93e66005a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"36858365-0cf5-4dbd-9d96-a0cc3048a4b0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a8dd967a-c378-4004-98e9-d5afc555788f.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b2b227c9-7965-4bdf-8a1e-71dcab1d9a16.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b068ad8e-f798-4cc8-b74f-96a37fcf510c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Roland on the Run","Overview":"A bit of a Frogger clone with a frosting of the popular Roland franchise to make it all go down easily.

You have the ability to directly enter buildings, and a changing score is constantly kept.\n\nThe land of Belorm consists of Warriors, Wizards and Elves. The Great Wizards ensured centuries of peace, before legions of orcs attacked from the Northern Wastes. A series of sneak attacks weakened Belorm, the last of them killing Elwin. However, the Great Book leads Greymarel the Wizard to believe that Kordomir is the mythical Dark One, and the greatest threat. Now Belorm and can only be saved if Greymarel, Eliador (the last of the Elves), and Morval the Warrior can find the Runestone, a sacred device sculpted by Zaphir the Great Wizard.\n\nCommands are input from the keyboard. You can move in a direction by typing (for example) GO or MOVE E, or alternatively can LOOK E and then GO – only N\/S\/E\/W movement is offered, so moving northeast requires 2 moves. Instructions for other characters are issued using TELL or ASK. When issuing combat instructions, you can specify the target orc and the weapon to be used. Chain commands are accepted.\n\nGreymarel has little spell-casting ability as the game starts, but can gain many as they are discovered. He also has many strange relics, which may prove to be of use. Key NPCs include Chronos the Wise, Quester the Hermit and Brunor the Bold.

Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.\n\nThe winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed).

At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. \"Energy\" plays an important role, there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you.\n\nThe object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. \n\nThe Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a \"robot hull\" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. \n\nThere are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a \"Meanie\" which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.\n\nSentinel Returns is a remake very true to the original.","Publisher":"Firebird Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"159439":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"74df9a65-5445-48b1-b806-09dcaf6984eb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c70bf81a-0e4b-4a81-9087-ddb2acd1c7e4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a17ef668-ccc6-451b-98a7-7844d298bff2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f83fb85-7d89-458a-8856-8495a923d8f2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26b25743-572c-4ed2-8ad7-2e06457b347a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e1dd4dcf-45ee-4bba-a41e-f6bcb769cd3a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ea199cc3-06a9-4adf-9191-89a7e7ec71dd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c9df8c53-3f53-4814-9971-116384365d65.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d5a3fe8c-102d-4f16-bf15-1f375aef2179.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sepulcri","Overview":"It is the year 2075 and the first satellite of Strategic Defense initiative is in its early stages of development.\nIt has been discovered that it is really impossible to test this weapon system, without causing the conflict whose prevention is its design objective.

It is best to shoot them, however, because surviving mines may come back from the side, which is deadly. After reaching the station, the game becomes a Pac-Man variant. In a maze-like field the player needs to pick up glowing balls on the floor without being touched by the enemies. But there are two important differences: the player controls a tank, i.e. he can shoot the foes, and he doesn't have to pick up all balls. If he got enough, he can simply use the exit. However, a few balls can't be picked up and the pattern needs to be remembered,\n\nDuring the last mini game the player gets presented with a panel of buttons. He bounces a ball on those buttons to recreate the pattern from before. He needs to look after a force field which follows the ball's movements - touching it results in losing a life.

Not only are rude actions like flying kicks allowed, but the playing field is filled with obstacles like pits or disintegrators. Stepping on those causes the athlete to die and the need to use one of the two substitute athletes. Those have different stats (strength, reaction, shooting and balance) which influence the match - if there are enough alive, the player can choose the used athlete at the start of the match.

Famous detectives from all over the world have been summoned to investigate the thefts. You play Benton, the bumbling butler who wants to try to solve the case before anyone else, while at the same time providing timely butlering services.\n\nBenton may start the game in one of five house layouts. The houses are populated by walls, furniture of various sorts, collectable objects, and moving inhabitants (such as the Snodgers, their pets the Snodgits, and famous detectives such as Padlock Holmes and Hercules Parrot). The view of the house is isometric, and the view can be rotated by 90 degrees by pressing the fire button, which is sometimes necessary to see obscured objects. There is also a plan view of the current floor at the bottom of the screen.\n\nBenton's main job, screamed at him by one of the snodgits, will be to collect an object from around the house and give it to a particular Snodger family member. Benton's current position, and the position of the object to be retrieved are marked on the plan view. Stairways between floors are also marked on the plan view by a very small dot next to one of the walls. Benton's currently held object is displayed at the bottom left, and he can swap this for another object by walking into it. Passing by a Snodger allows Benton to swap his item with whatever they are carrying. Once the required object is collected, the receiver of the object also becomes highlighted on the plan view. Successful delivery of the item will allow Benton to collect a clue to the mystery.\n\nThe clue is in the form of a vaguely Mastermind like \"clue table\". The left side of the table shows three rows. Each row contains four people. Each person is associated with an object, and those objects are displayed on the right hand side, but not in order. Benton's task is then to determine which person is associated with a particular named object within the time limit. If he guesses correctly, that person is added to the \"guilty\" box at the bottom right of the screen. You then have to tell your information to a detective. Providing information on three criminals is enough to solve the level, and you immediately start again in a new larger house.\n\nComplicating matters is that Benton has a limited number of snodges and bodges.

Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttles engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (autosimulator and simulator mode) are included. The autosimulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"159542":{"Cooperative":"true","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"efc65103-47e2-4869-9545-6e9f507163e6.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"82e99646-0fd2-46ed-be78-6251cff7f42f.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"542927f4-1e98-428c-bb2b-140892a82a09.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1af05412-416d-4944-85d3-effe287258c0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be80ca64-4288-47b0-953d-0dab2e82c4dd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"ac1fb52d-2619-4ba0-beb1-a644896698d9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"46b677d7-7f42-4f10-ba09-27adae6fc4e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1f34227f-261d-4b2d-a619-8684e87fc66c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Space Smugglers","Overview":"Download the original manual (Spanish) in PDF\/JGP\/ZIP \n\nIntroduction\n\nYou've just been elected to clean up the galaxy from the Space Smugglers (Space Pirates), the most dangerous murderers of the universe.\n\nStay tuned, because any failure can be fatal, your enemies will not have pity on you.\n\nYou know, steady pulse, cold - blooded, aim and ... for it !\n\n\nCharacters: \n\nBARBARA: It 's a space warrior accurate.

No spots, but they do randomly set up two numbers between zero and six. Throwing a double means you move twice.\n\nThere has to be competition, in this case the Nasties. These swarm over the playing area and try to get in your way. You can't jump over them, but you can move on top of one to space it out. Hence the name of the game.

Every screen has pipes and platforms and ladders and nasty rats.  The pipes start to leak and you have to use your trusty spanner to stop them.  As the water leaks out, it starts to fill up the screen from below, if the water gets too high then it covers some of the platforms and pipes.  This means to fix those pipes you have to hold your breath, once under water a counter starts counting down from 99, once it reaches 0, you drown (it resets when you come up for air).  And if that wasn't bad enough, there are huges rats after you as well AND there is randomly falling debris coming from the top of the screen, which you have to dodge.  To get around the rats you can either jump over them or kick them.\n\nThe action gets quite frantic, with the pipes leaking, the water rising, debris falling and rats everywhere… you are madly trying to run and jump and climb up and down ladders to fix the leaks.  You know eventually you will croak from something, it's only a matter of time…","Publisher":"Amsoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"159546":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"8af8a1ed-e6d0-4998-8210-a31a9e0525ff.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"404e63f6-9a05-44d0-93fa-6af613241777.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"24c1419d-d169-4775-ba39-0e1c2e558803.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"92f0b3eb-be9f-45ab-8e60-f171c306a361.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5466f8e6-ee2a-48d1-ae6d-2ae22c640e2d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1aab23d8-68f2-4032-9942-9c7f1d073b9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Special Operations","Overview":"During World War II a highly guarded compound has been photographed by a reconnaissance plane hidden in a forest. After many intelligent reports it has been discovered that under the compound is a research complex which is getting nearer to the development of a bacterial virus and a new type of rocket which when combined will cause devastation and disease. You and a team of four, have been tasked to parachute into the forest in the surrounding area of the compound to find it's location, then get in the compound before trying to enter the complex. Once in the compound you have to get the plans for the virus, rocket fuel and guidance system before finally blowing the place up. Once your mission has been completed you must then get to a rendezvous point to be picked up by a plane. Remember though, the surrounding areas have patrolling guards and the compound and complex are heavily guarded.\n\nBefore you start you can pick from seven missions where each one is more difficult than the last one. The first mission is just to find the compound and photograph it while the last mission is where you have to actually blow up the complex and reach the rendezvous point. You then choose how long in hours (1-9 times ten) the mission will take before the plane arrives. Each movement in the forest is worth 20 minutes while inside the compound it is 2 minutes. Once you are happy with your selected options you must pick a team of four soldiers to attempt the mission with yourself. There are 30 skills to choose from in which you as the leader have all 30 but the other soldiers only have two of them. You are only aware of one skill for each soldier so you can interview each man to find the other skill or just select them. Each interview will take a day but you only have eight days before the mission starts. \n\nOnce you are happy with your selections you then start the game. You view the forest from above with the whole forest shown on the screen. You cannot see any terrain but just the trees. You are shown as a flashing square and you can see any objects one place around you in the North, South, East and West positions. There are location's that can be found as you explore the area and they are caves, potholes, lakes or houses. These can be explored for any equipment that might be left there and next to the map of the forest is a map of the location you want to explore. You can only see so far in front so you have to move around to see more of the location's passages. Any items found can be picked up. Occasionally in the forest you will come across a patrol and these will need killing. To the right of the forest map again is a map of the area you are in showing your men's positions and the positions of the patrol. You then select which enemy soldier any of your soldiers will shoot at then move your soldier selected two places. You fire at the patrol and then they fire back. You then choose which soldier shoots who again and move them until all the patrol are dead or you have all been killed.\n\nOnce you have found the complex, the screen shows an aerial view of the whole complex. Here you then attempt to complete what mission you picked at the start. It is now up to you how you want to enter the compound and move about remembering the guard patrols inside cannot be seen. If you manage to get into the complex without being discovered you move around the complex to complete the missions. Once you have fulfilled your objectives you must get out of the complex, then the compound and finally find the rendezvous point to go home. If you are captured you will be interrogated and shot.","Publisher":"MC Lothlorien","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"159547":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ed Hickman","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"2d6b5771-7be2-4b46-a025-90f8b34d918d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"82bf5496-e974-4b2c-b02f-a98121912ff0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2dcc5dfc-fe1c-4128-b7d1-3b8f9dc24a38.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"34ed3f64-8b9b-44bc-89d8-f8e3838328ee.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f8260de5-ae2c-4c4c-b449-d4b9c3f9a267.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5b224e4d-2049-4650-8669-affe6ba50c16.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"23c7b967-6ec9-4922-81c2-6b970d100844.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"b21eb53b-f2bb-452f-9871-73ce5a16dcff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Speed King","Overview":"Speed King is a motorbike racing game that allows you to race or practise on one of ten famous tracks like Silverstone, Monza and Daytona.

The planets are split into five groups, each of which can be chosen at the start of the game. \n\nThe combat is intense, and aims to create the likely feel of space combat, with lots of ducking and weaving to set up shots. The game features filled-in graphics, unlike the Elite-esque wireframes of the first game.","Publisher":"Firebird Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LUlCkXguDJM"},"159574":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"83a404e8-505a-452e-9f04-c5f8228e3d83.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f040d8d-8a58-46ad-969c-1e6faebc5a5b.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bc16e587-57df-47f2-9fec-a809e6685b45.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e9c3fbcd-43a0-4a43-a32c-e2f976e32298.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"4f6b9aae-a291-4991-9e05-ac0a33125eb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"46ca4854-0276-49f0-b307-cf31bb0d0df7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"721c979b-cc30-4658-8ce4-205ad26f1f5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Steve Davis Snooker","Overview":"Mike Lamb recreated the basic rules of the popular English game of snooker in this simulation, which can be played by one or two players, but has no computer opponent as such, unlike the later 16-bit remake.\n\nInstead, you are scored based not only on how many points you score legitimately, but also on how many points you concede through foul shots, and how many shots you take in total. You always take the next shot, even if you've missed or fouled, so in a one player game the break-building strategies can be slightly more aggressive than in a real match, as there's no risk of leaving an opponent a chance\n\nAs in the real game you start off by trying to pot a red (there are 10 or the real 15, depending on which mode you choose), and if successful choosing one of the 6 colours (by pressing the number corresponding to its points value).

The baddies are driving XR3's, so all it would take is one laser blast in the XR3 fuel tank, and the cars are immobilized.\n\nZooming along, the player has to serve through traffic, dodging the bullets fired by the bad guys and eliminating carloads of criminals while taking care not to kill innocent citizens. As well as the built-in lasers, Jesse's bike can leap into the air, and a well-timed spring can avoid a collision. A crash or a blast from a villain's gun is not fatal, as the bike can take a fair bit of damage before it is immobilized. Reckless driving is not tolerated, and if too many civilians are killed, the police will be in pursuit. If the police catches up with the bike, the game ends. However, the turbo facility can be used to make a quick getaway.\n\nAfter driving along, the player needs to keep an eye on the gauges that indicate the condition of the lasers, the damage inflicted on the bike, and the engine temperature. Points are awarded for each of the villain's car blown up and for each civilian overtaken. While driving, Jesse receives a message regarding a break-in at the liquor store. It is up to him to take it slowly so that he can arrive there safely.\n\nAt the liquor store, you must destroy three villains who run out of the store and attempt to escape in their getaway van.

The screen during the race is divided into three parts: at the top you have the main view of the rider on the track, profile view with horizontal scrolling to the right; in the middle, a view on a smaller scale of the track from above, always with horizontal sliding; below are the on-board instrumentation (tachometer, speedometer, gear) and the time and score indicators. The player can steer, adjust the speed, use the three-speed manual transmission, rear wheel or rear wheel both on the ground and in the air, lower the rider. The steering changes the lateral position of the bike, which is only visible in the plan view. The routes may include various obstacles such as steep slopes, suspended trunks, rivers, parked vehicles, rocky stretches or with bumps, all to be faced with different techniques and speeds. At the beginning the obstacles are all aligned, but as the difficulty increases, the lateral movement of the bike becomes necessary to intercept them. You can suffer time penalty in various ways: missing an obstacle, facing it incorrectly, or falling, which may depend on unsuitable speed to the ground, landing with the wrong wheel, stall. After each mistake, the race is immediately resumed from a point just before, with no damage except for the time penalty; after a certain number of attempts the obstacle is automatically skipped."},"160012":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"69eeea06-164c-497e-8539-ae380e47bb71.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"24eeb2f2-2507-4594-929e-035274dcbfc6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f0c7e740-8754-4731-9ef6-c47fae1d27f2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"69f0ac0c-ede8-4a77-8b96-241931b0d552.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8a63bf01-b002-4383-bedd-1afcb5c33809.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8a5217c1-f3ea-42cc-9f24-f2f55b8b0606.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"72b6a56a-3ea9-4fe4-839c-05c6776215e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"45a69e1f-abbf-46a8-96b7-7bd8870797de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e84dbec9-06dc-4e47-bd95-f52ea11d807f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Super Space Invaders","Overview":"Remember that arcade classic Invaders?

It was converted to the Game Boy Color in 2001. The game was considered a spiritual successor to Tecmo arcade game Silkworm, which The Sales Curve had previously converted to home computer formats in 1989. The game's heritage is evident from the game design whereby one player pilots a helicopter, and the other an armoured Jeep. SWIV is not an official sequel, as noted by ex-Sales Curve producer Dan Marchant: \"SWIV wasn't really a sequel to Silkworm, but it was certainly inspired by it and several other shoot-'em-ups that we had played and loved.\"[1] In the game's own manual (for the Amiga, at least), however, it was explained that \"SWIV\" was both an acronym for \"Special Weapons Interdiction Vehicle\" and also short for \"Silkworm IV\" (even though there was not a Silkworm II or III). SWIV is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which plays in a typical fashion to other games in its genre. The player chooses between using either a helicopter or a jeep at the beginning of the game and then plays in their chosen vehicles through scrolling levels, shooting at oncoming enemies. If two players are present, both vehicles will be used at once. Certain enemies when shot drop shield power-ups which can be either picked up to afford temporarily invincibility or detonated to destroy all enemies onscreen. Every so often a boss enemy will attack. The destruction of these bosses will give upgrades to the player's forward firing gun.","Publisher":"Storm Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"160029":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"0fc26a16-6fb2-4c6d-9f2f-addce22e2412.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"84643682-ecfd-4d4d-9a08-1350699ae9f6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b927751-a63f-4865-a247-070362814e65.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0f8e13d8-1d22-427a-9fc2-fe55478b8887.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"6a1141e5-4398-4351-9eca-867d1adf232d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf0e4832-8d20-45bc-9510-8dbfc4f88153.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sword of the Samurai","Overview":"The object of the game is to rescue the hostages who are being held against their will by a renegade martial arts gang.

The Samurai has the ability to drop a magical crystal by pulling down on flat ground. This means that the Warrior will return to this spot after he has lost a life. The Samurai can also pick up the crystal by the same method and take it with him to a later part of the level. As well as the deadly Sword which can only be drawn in hand to hand combat, the Samurai has Shurikans which can be thrown at the enemy from a distance. Once two hostages have been rescued, the Samurai has the ability to throw cut throat daggers instead of Shurikans. After all of the hostages have been rescued, the Samurai must take them to the end of the level to successfully complete his mission.","Publisher":"Zeppelin Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"160052":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3d5bbb29-ba6a-4f2d-a7de-5424187a8959.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"de56ec47-4d82-45db-a541-c9181a7c5b98.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b4fe50a1-3f92-4000-a614-957c4e5e8e95.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e9091de5-372e-4eb9-babe-24a4f9815be9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9b80bf88-8cfa-460f-a610-d4538943c254.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d7c71f56-6e0e-444c-b9eb-639a7c06f711.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"15da0b83-80ee-4612-8cc1-e5d89c079b55.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5d10e75c-1b59-4f3f-a353-9745f265b38b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"05fe14ed-c2a5-4b8f-a30c-ee5fd36f1c11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Sword Slayer","Overview":"You are Spartacus and you are a Gladiator planning to rebel against the Roman Empire by escaping from slavery and releasing all the other slaves from the Roman Crassus.

Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. Now is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther. After consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. Objects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them. If Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup."},"160061":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"749308dc-39fa-4c3f-986e-2f95078cc8cb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ab371c9-af5b-44d4-9ba7-fb6291172862.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e7b8f23a-6a78-44d8-b263-3b4048ca4ad9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"96ab9730-29d2-4cd3-8402-da252f6b2224.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4ea9febf-a49e-40fa-b31f-20d9e2444f2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Task Force","Overview":"Although having the same name and plot from the Commodore versions, the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum both have enough differences to warrant a separate entry.

Find the Princess and ... who knows what may happen but I'm sure you have a fair idea. First you have to kill the STONE-MASTER. This is not as simple as it may seen. There are many problems to p erplex your green brain as well as a whole host of nasties to drain your reptilian energy. *THE THIEF* After six toad time units a thief will appear on the screen and infuriate you by stealing any items it finds lying around; you may very well need those particular objects. The thief can only hold one item but is very greedy (and stupid) and will d rop what it is carrying to steal another. It is possible to kill the thief but it takes a lot of en ergy and when he dies, takes whatever he is carrying with him to hell and damnation. Bad luck on the thief but it may be impossible to complete the mission without the missing object. *TRIPLE EXISTS* There are some occasions where there appear to be three exists in the same direction and they look the same from your side, but if you choose the wrong one then you will perish and lose all subsequent lives. To add to the fun the correct pat h may be different each time you try it but there is a way of predicting which path leads to the other side so keep your bug-eyes open for the position of rock cracks and flowers! *ON SCREEN INFORMATION* At the top of the screen there is some information which you really ought to look at. On the left are the contents of your four pockets (no pocket fluff in this game)! Next to these is a display of the percentage of the puzzle completed. Do not get too depressed reading this and remember finding the Princess gives you the 100%. The display next to this is your energy and this is explained in 'HOW TO DIE'. On the right hand side of the screen is the clock ticking away in toad time units. *HOW TO DIE* This is certainly the easiest part of the game! The re are a whole host of ways but they can be divided into two categories. The first way is by being squashed or taking wrong exit at a TRIPLE EXIT. These not only kill you but take all further lives. They say a cat has nine lives but a lesser known fact is that toads have five. To experience t he sensation of dying five times you have to drain your energy. This can be done by touching a flying bug (the only ones in this game!) or one of the guards at an exit. One or three of the guard s may take all your lives if they are feeling spiteful. You will see your energy draining in the display at the top of the screen. The best way to understand this is to try it. Stand next to the knight of the first screen. Once the meter turns completely black you will lose a life. A toad can o nly stay out of water for 75 TTUs and so after this you will go to the big green pond in the sky. *HINTS* Most, but not all, of the guards\/objects blocking exists can be removed. Trying to squeeze trough cannot be recommended! Once an object has been used then it probably will have no further use. Don't give up! So pick up your warts and hit the road and remember...be careful out there.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"160158":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f1f359db-d712-40aa-b793-d2432fbb707b.JPG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5de40149-c172-4867-84b3-13e3b76d6202.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"160b9f10-124f-4348-8b6e-5f353a52e092.JPG","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"87027a76-42ad-4364-969d-75c5c10dd8f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a375aa8a-5e54-40e2-9ae4-c6b6dda65988.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cb393cab-2395-4009-bdd8-ae4cc66dca3a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"73089992-8153-4518-94d5-b15a1420e113.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tensions","Overview":"Tensions is a closed poker game for four players.

In each classroom, Mikie has to collect all the hearts that are found in each classroom to form a message. In order to collect these hearts, Mikie must stand somewhere near them and shout out. There are two type of hearts: small and large. Mikie needs to shout out only once to collect the small hearts, and multiple times to collect the large ones. When a message is formed, Mikie can exit the classroom through a door marked OUT. Stopping him from collecting the hearts is the teacher, the chef, and the janitor. The teacher is the worst one. When he is unable to catch you, he works up a sweat, and eventually, throws his teeth at you. When his teeth hits Mikie, he loses one of his three lives. In later classrooms, Mikie can throw stuff at his enemies in order to stun them for several seconds (for instance, the basketballs in the locker room, and the chickens in the canteen). The janitor isn't as bad because he walks much slower than the others. In between levels, you have to enter the next classroom through a door marked IN without being caught, but you can do at least two things to pass time: Steal some lunch, and open one of the unmarked doors to receive a punch, a kick, or the chance to see a naked lady with breasts. Beware that if you take too long in the hallway and don't travel between floors, a bucket slides across the screen real fast and attempt to slip you.

Alien life-forms have been spotted coming out of the Loch at night and terrorising the locals and could even be putting The Loch Ness Monster in danger. Something must be done to stop the creatures so you have come across an old Scottish engineer who has designed and built a diving-bell type craft before his death. The diving bell is powered by Water and Seaweed to produce a electric current to power the bell.\n\nAs the engineer was old and dying he asked you to pilot the craft and gave you brief instructions on how to use it before he died. You also have managed to get a surface ship to aid you by lowering you into the water, lifting you out and re-supplying you with spears and fuel. Before you dive you must indicate on a map of the Loch to the Captain where you need lowering to kill the alien life-forms.\n\nOnce in the murky depths of the dark water you view your surrounding world from a 1st person perspective. You have four windows in front, behind, port side and starboard side which can be looked out but beware as the craft will only go forward. Below the windows is your instrument panel with many instruments on it to keep you alive and complete your mission. Your main gauge to watch out for is your Oxygen and when it gets low (a bell will also warn you) you can use a pump to keep it topped up. A fuel gauge will also let you know your fuel levels.\n\nYou are able to move the craft by various devices and levers which enable you to move forward, turn left or right, and lower or raise the craft. A wheel used to turn yourself will also generate power for energy when used. To kill any alien life-forms you have a spear gun which has a limited supply of spears to use. You can fire the spears from any side of the craft as well as lower or raise the gun. If a life-form attaches itself to the craft you can also activate a electric field, they attach if you are stationary and will do damage to the craft. Your last defence is dropping bombs but if you don't operate the plunger when dropping the bombs and you don't get away from the area you will blow yourself up.\n\nIf you run out of spears or low on fuel you can sound a klaxon to get the Captain above to send you more down. Once the supplies have reached the bottom you can use your magnet to pick them up. You are able to switch your lights on and off to save energy and your last instrument is a compass. Once you have searched a certain area you can go back up to the ship and search another part of the Loch."},"160186":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"06ea14b1-a04c-47e6-bd9b-cb77caee472e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ed802905-f4ec-4c21-9d76-03f1021710e0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a5d60bc9-d51f-4f3c-8b63-7bd55da76c0b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"536a9375-c394-4020-a359-d963e6d08f5a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f521efbc-62f5-4b78-adec-33601629e84a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Terrormolinos","Overview":"As with most Melbourne House adventures, Terrormolinos has a real-world setting.

The large on-screen dragon was animated with a lot of detail on the head, wings and legs, and the background had a semi-3D parallax scrolling system, akin to the semi-3D systems seen in other Durell games such as Fat Worm, Combat Lynx and Turbo Esprit. The game's title music, composed by Julian Breeze, is multi-channeled on the Spectrum's single 'beep' channel, using the same multi-channel engine as some other Durell titles. On Spectrum 128, the title music has actual multiple channels.\n\nIn the game the player must guide the dragon through the land flying towards the right, and fight its way through a multitude of enemies, both humans and fantasy creatures: sea snakes, giant spiders, a hostile two-headed dragon. They can be burned with the dragon's fiery breath, or they can be grabbed with the dragon's claws and dropped onto other enemies. Boulders can also be picked up and dropped on enemies. To win the game, the dragon's mission is to pick up an enchantress for a ride, then safely deliver her to find a book of spells, and finally take her to a magic cauldron so she may cast her spell. The enchantress brings extra challenge to the task, as she must be kept safe from harm. If Thanatos turns around too fast while flying, she may fall off and must be picked up again. If the sorceress is slain or Thanatos dies, the game will end.\n\nThe dragon makes its way through a few strongholds, whose gates must be burned through (apparently the castle walls are too tall to fly over). If the dragon runs out of fire breath, it must backtrack to find a virgin strapped to a pole, land nearby, and walk closer to eat the virgin. This will restore the dragon's breath. However, be wary as a knight is waiting in ambush and attacks the dragon while it's landed and vulnerable.\n\nThe dragon's health is indicated by a beating heart in the bottom of the screen. As the dragon takes hits from enemies the heart starts beating faster and faster, and near death it starts flashing blue. The dragon must withdraw to safety to rest and recover.","Publisher":"Durell Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yJ6Yfx_H2g0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thanatos_(video_game)"},"160232":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"04a43533-5880-4f11-9883-1f565eaf3146.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"80d2ab25-9f37-4064-a2b8-a8a9c7f28443.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"618d4707-9b1d-485b-8acc-fd72ccfe0d5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"43f25bed-9280-438e-bb16-60b05911aa25.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Thingy and the Doodahs","Overview":"You have just broken your computer (insert computer make according to the platform the game is running on).

It was written by Don Priestley and based on the British children's television show of the same name. In The Trap Door, the player takes control of Berk, who must perform tasks for \"The Thing Upstairs\" a never-seen entity who lives in the upper floors of the castle where Berk works. In order to help him complete his task, Berk must make use of the many objects lying around his part of the castle as well as the creatures that emerge from the trap door. Berk is assisted by Boni, a talking skull, who provides hints when picked up. He is also somewhat hindered by Drutt, a spider who loves eating worms. Gameplay is largely based around puzzle-solving and the use and manipulation of the many objects littered around Berk's chambers. Berk will also need help from some of the strange creatures that lurk in the caverns under the trap door and these creatures can often be as much a hindrance as a help (as well as downright dangerous). Once Berk has finished taking advantage of a creature's \"assistance\" he also has to find a way of making sure it goes back down the trap door. The game has two different skill levels: \"Learner Berk\" and \"Super Berk\". The difference is that \"Super Berk\" mode includes flying ghosts that appear a set time after each task is announced. The ghosts hinder the player's progress by attacking Berk, sending him spinning into another room if he doesn't manage to avoid them. The game can only be completed in \"Super Berk\" mode. The music was composed by David Dunn It was followed by a sequel in 1987 called Through The Trap Door, also written by Priestley and published by Piranha."},"160314":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Stefan Walker","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5734c0b6-9121-487d-a538-809ca95da9a8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0d2bb55a-6942-44f2-b859-67fd3de85122.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"567aefa0-429b-4a5f-8136-188d89cab11b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6cd26b13-baa4-46ab-b844-a9aabf3a1200.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e167fa2c-179a-4fea-8bf7-4b428e935af0.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5861b809-f18e-43a9-8b36-cc28af55f71f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1791a2b7-b348-4381-816b-7a6a703d7cb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b60737b3-ba50-42f1-b8f4-dc75d4301cbb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c8c2c55a-d9e3-450b-b9a1-dcb0f96afe49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Trap","Overview":"A once peaceful ally is now your enemy and you are tasked to defend your planet against them.

The first of the direct consequences resulting from this disaster was a radiation leak inside the reactor accelerating the need for a special intervention.\n\nThis urgency demanded for military extreme measures, and so the Combat Droid Development unit was contacted to answer for this type of emergency. \n\nGen 19, an untested droid prototype developed by the same military entity, gathers all the requirements needed to succeed on this difficult mission ahead. \n\nPlaying as the combat droid, the player has to gather all the necessary pieces of a new EDS and insert it at the main processor. He carries distinct weapons for distinct hostilities, namely Cyberfreeze discs, Remote Controlled Autodrones and Deuteron Grenades. Their respective ammunition is limited except for the 23MW blast laser which has infinite laser charges. His energy is constantly diminishing even without having hostile contact, although blocks of massive energy can be punctually found during the gameplay. Additional supplies of ammunition can also be found scattered inside the maze.\n\nGen 19 uses a levitation device allowing him to move by air and ground. He also can travel through teleporting portals.","Publisher":"Dro Soft","ReleaseYear":1986},"160323":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John Foster","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"1d0bd926-9c72-490a-9bc3-54ea64191186.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"1f039fe6-077b-4659-9c96-40622d4a91b6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"50048bc9-373d-477e-b878-604edfb7b087.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ce40b5a1-9ac6-4a40-9532-426f58447193.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"14d832b0-bc13-40b6-a8fa-b4d2f83d9b39.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9db2cf2c-fd0d-42a9-b949-2fc9f982bbec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f9899fe4-36e3-4f24-b6c2-ec054015bdce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Turbo Kart Racer","Overview":"Grab a Go-Kart and race it against three other racers to become champion over four tracks.

As well as making managerial decisions you can even play for the entire team! But before you get your boots on, there's a bit of managing to do via the icon-driven menu system. Of course, no amount of training will be enough for some old snoggers so they can be sold and new players bought via the transfer system. Matches are viewed from side-on view. Both United and the opposition can be player or computer-controlled. Players dribble automatically and shoot when the fire button is released - the strength of kick determined by the time fire was held down. In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick. In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX. Gameplay is not that great since it is frustratingly difficult to score goals. Man Utd fans will enjoy the almost forgotten experience of winning the league. Like the team, strictly second division.","Publisher":"Krisalis Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"164347":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Code Masters","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"76275665-c81f-4e3f-9bd5-e13343476f20.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9fa8d945-1ec7-4f9a-b91e-d2abc667e67d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"29604cab-dfbe-45c9-b239-31cf68063819.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"77014a6e-49c7-4f17-92c6-b99b926de4ff.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e37b24c-1c42-419e-a9af-8572f8a0408a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"1a6c33d3-08c0-4ff4-b314-433588b7d84d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7a17aa18-d3fb-48e5-a216-d107ff32cfe7.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"17746325-b3c0-4789-83a6-c9f5622edc16.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Death Stalker","Overview":"Death Stalker is 2D platform\/adventure game.

A legend whose antiquity was lost in the abyss of the times assured the existence a parchment that, when read by the evil forces, would trigger such big wave of disasters that Satan would be able to seize the Earth and assure his dominion as the prince of the darkness.\n\nThe audacious protagonist, having learned about the legend, decided to recover it for the forces of the good, since the legend also affirmed that if this document would be read by two persons of good intentions, its effects would be annulled for ever. With this objective in mind, he begins to search the magical key that released the spell that had hidden the parchment. But the task is not going to be simple. Many other knights decided to find the parchment, hoping to attain glory or for less worthy reasons.

Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.\n\nAs with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.","Publisher":"The Codemasters Software Company Limited","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"173366":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Jean‑François Streiff","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"32f91ea1-3770-4152-894a-b3f0bd01a83e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bd0dd803-c2f8-46bf-a47d-cb0a4084aec0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4bd44a56-700c-4477-8d65-521496102729.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"269024a0-f40b-42aa-b4c0-dbd259d0b2b4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2bfad570-d978-435c-a400-e4052c12c687.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"937bf99b-3f78-443e-b900-b1cb11430496.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bumpy","Overview":"The first game in the Bumpy series is, just like its sequels, about a head that can bump a lot.

The objective of the game is not initially clear. The Wizard of Frobozz is soon introduced. The wizard was once a respected enchanter, but when his powers began to fade he was exiled by Lord Dimwit Flathead. Now bordering on senility, the wizard is still a force to be reckoned with. The player's goal in the wizard's realm is to avoid his capricious tricks and to learn to control his magic. Zork II has two notoriously difficult puzzles: the Bank puzzle, in which the player must figure out how to walk through several bank walls in order to figure out how to get out of bank with the loot from the vault without tripping the security alarm; and the Oddly-Angled Room, a diamond-shaped room filed with panes of glass representing baseball bases. The player must figure out how to traverse the diamond in order to open a door that will lead to the game's finale. Like its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt. Unlike the previous game, the ten treasures are tied together by a crude plot. Finding the treasures does not end the game, nor are all the treasures needed to finish the game. Instead, the adventurer must figure out a way to use the treasures in order to reach the game's finale.","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"173397":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Zork I: The Great Underground Empire"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"1f855669-7b49-4634-b155-0bbf0f83357c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4379b742-c847-4bff-8f42-e0cb77559607.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b53b1cb2-3691-49b6-9669-2b6a8aaa07e6.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9f736039-7666-4188-ac5a-1701967deedf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Zork I","Overview":"The game takes place in the Zork calendar year 948 GUE (although the passage of time is not notable in gameplay). The player steps into the deliberately vague role of an \"adventurer\". The game begins near a white house in a small, self-contained area. Although the player is given little instruction, the house provides an obvious point of interest. When the player enters the house, it yields a number of intriguing objects, including a brass, battery-powered lantern, an empty trophy case, and an Elvish sword of great antiquity. Beneath the rug a trap door leads down into a dark cellar, which is revealed to be one of several entrances to a vast subterranean land known as the Great Underground Empire. The player soon encounters dangerous creatures, including deadly grues who only prey on their victims in the dark, an axe-wielding troll, a giant cyclops who cowers at the mention of Odysseus, and a nimble-fingered thief who makes mapping the maze difficult by removing or scattering any items that the player might drop to leave a trail. The ultimate goal of Zork I is to collect the Twenty Treasures of Zork and install them in the trophy case. Finding the treasures requires solving a variety of puzzles such as the navigation of two complex mazes and some intricate manipulations at Flood Control Dam #3.","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"173398":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"92d34adf-e41c-4520-96f5-dba8178be2bc.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"6cdc8149-ce71-44b8-a8b1-d9aa93eda722.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a9403334-aef3-41fe-aa6b-8b98d7d15daa.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6db0ca32-b55e-4583-82f4-00d229bc4123.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"17013ab9-9bab-4e2b-a880-4f5b38082b77.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4a4c9b17-3ba5-4a85-90f4-eca15211b859.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5c261a3f-5948-4c9e-96bd-3a1a5c207512.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"01fae198-2591-4347-88b3-78118a6d3b1b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Zaxx","Overview":"Finally on your AMSTRAD CPC\na faithful adaptation of the famous coffee room game.\n\nEverything is there:\nhoming missiles, anti-aircraft turrets,\nenemy fighters, laser barrier,\nsaucers, etc ...\n\nSeven different tables follow one another,\neach table bringing you closer\nand closer to the ultimate battle\nagainst the robot of the fortress.\n\nArcade games 100% machine language\nwith remarkable graphics and animation.","Publisher":"Chip","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"173399":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"c05621fb-ac25-4fd6-9798-22f06496b808.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"43217302-1d79-4db8-82d2-ca70bf917f0c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0c63887c-bb3c-49d6-9a0a-b5c34972ab4f.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"af5dd98e-27c9-4d6a-be77-7a45f77bd186.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8c39be68-9a51-4638-a824-9712902811e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"377c284b-aad5-49bb-b3ca-8883546ab873.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Zampabolas","Overview":"Zampabolas is an unofficial conversion of the classic board game called Hungry Hungry Hippos.

The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector graphics with a first-person perspective. The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks. In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers.

Dynamite Dan is back to put a stop to this, by exploring the 8 islands in turn to find the pieces of the puzzle. There are 192 screens in total - 24 on each island - all loaded with enemies on fixed attack patterns. Some move diagonally, others home in on Dan, and some move horizontally - all of them detract from Dan's energy level, eventually leading to death and failure, and some can steal objects from him. The record and jukebox are randomly placed on each go, as are the enemies. Dan can jump far, and his jumps are bigger if he has taken a run-up. There are many objects to collect - a torch for theft protection, bomb goggles to blow doors open, foods for restored energy (and a mixer for infinite energy), and dumbells to increase jump size. All of these are used automatically. To escape each island he must also find enough fuel for his trusty Zeppelin.","Publisher":"Zafiro Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"173459":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ubi Soft Entertainment Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"1f444462-0c39-4eca-a687-2208e22b2721.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"dab72d6b-04df-479f-b7b2-68b3ec26b713.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"364caed5-e50a-46ec-a072-96b0e4e11b46.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fe2d2ff2-9137-440b-a4e7-5c57cb420285.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e938e75e-e61f-4e4e-9908-c106f00392ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"234cb985-45ae-4ed2-90cd-e05e30549a49.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"443aace3-c6c4-4240-9dbc-2e6e624d6e17.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"37ddfcc0-4f05-467a-b3b2-26f74868b584.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Iron Lord","Overview":"Iron Lord is a strategy game with action and light adventure elements, set in the Middle Ages and featuring hand-drawn graphics.

It is the third game to be based on the popular MASK comics, TV series, and books of the mid 1980's. The M.A.S.K., Mobile Armored Strike Kommand, organisation led by Matt Trakker, are battling the criminal organization known as V.E.N.O.M., Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem. Combat in the previous two games has been based around the transformer like vehicles used by M.A.S.K., not so in this game. In this game Matt's son has been kidnapped by V.E.N.O.M. and has been taken to the moon. Matt has been given an ultimatum, disband M.A.S.K. and leave the world at the mercy of V.E.N.O.M., or never see his son alive again. Matt sets out for the moon where he must overcome the defences of V.E.N.O.M.'s base, rescue his son and steal a rocket back to earth. In his quest he is helped by special masks that give him special powers. For example one mask will give Matt the ability to shoot bullets others will allow him to fly, pass through solid objects, float across bodies of water, have temporary invulnerability and so on. However, Matt can only carry four masks and can only use one mask at a time. Each mask has just 99 units of energy, or bullets, and this number is reduced each time the mask is used so eventually the mask will need replacing. At the end of each level as Matt progresses to the next the player gets a code word. This codeword can be typed in when the game is re-loaded allowing the player to restart at the new level.","Publisher":"Gremlin  Graphics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"173593":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Soft Option Ltd","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"33afc802-6360-4e42-a715-1182974efea6.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9776cc45-0687-41a0-bc85-1049bed91474.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"32863f00-b8a6-4974-9cbd-f495b54f4ff2.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"ee482ec7-a084-4049-a7dc-427bbdef52e7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"25d21991-959b-4ea3-a020-f1abac903d5c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"dbf82e28-5b0a-4b4c-a918-a04e84a49d63.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory","Overview":"Roald Dahl's famous children's novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which comes included), is the basis for this set of 5 different mini-games:\nGuide Augustus Gloop floating through a maze of tubes of a machine in the candy factory so that he arrives safely into a flask, by changing his direction to the correct tube.\n\n• Avoid deadly blueberries that Violet Beauregarde throws at you from gaps in the wall of the juicing room.\n• Veruca Salt must avoid squirrels who toss poisonous nuts at her.\n• Mike Teavee must jump to different platforms to collect chocolate bars while avoiding killer TV cameras.\n• When the first four games are beaten, a code for the final fifth game given will be given.

The evening's performance must bring in that money or the circus will be seized. The bank does not play fair, though: they send the evil clown Fiendish Freddy to sabotage the acts. The performance consists of six different events. There is a practice mode for single events, and up to five players can compete in the full game, but must reach the $10.000 on their own, not together. The money is awarded by a jury after each act. The acts are: High Diving: Horace the High Diver must jump from a platform and land on a target down below. While falling, Horace must be kept spinning by moving the joystick while at the same time staying over the target. Once he is spinning fast enough, he must perform a pose indicated on the screen by pulling the joystick in a certain direction, after which a new pose is required, continuing until Horace hits the target (or the ground). If completed successfully, the next dive begins from a higher platform, giving Horace more time to perform the poses, while the target gets consecutively smaller. Money is awarded for performing poses if the target is hit. Freddy comes into play if Horace doesn't make a pose in time: he blows Horace off course with a giant fan. Juggling: Jeffy Joe drives across the arena on a unicycle and must catch and juggle items thrown to him by his seal assistant. The act ends successfully after a time limit is up and fails if Joe drops five items. Joe must be maneuvered so that the items land in his outstretched hands. Pushing fire throws the item in his left hand and moves the items in the right hand to the left. In higher levels, a baby comes into play which Joe must throw in such a way that it lands in a carriage. Freddy tries to sabotage the act by distracting the seal and then throwing dangerous items like bombs and missiles. If either is dropped, the act is over. Bombs however can be thrown back to Freddy. Trapeze: Finola must cross the big top by swinging on bars. She gains momentum through joystick moves and must then jump to the next bar by hitting fire at the correct moment. After a while, Finola must also maneuver through obstacles like paper targets and flaming hoops, which sometimes bob up and down. If Finola takes too long hanging on a bar without going forward, Freddy will arrive flying via helicopter blades and cut the ropes. Knife Throw: Knancy Knife has been blindfolded and strapped to a rotating wheel along with a number of balloons. There is a time limit and a limited number of knives to throw. The goal is of course to pop all the balloons without hurting Knancy. If she is hit, she screams out and several knives are removed from the stock. Freddy tries to sabotage the act by occasionally throwing smoke bombs for confusion. Tightrope: Tony Tiptoe tries to cross the tent on a tightrope. He is moved forward by pushing up on the joystick. He will soon begin to lose his balance and must be put back straight by corrective joystick movements to the left or right. If his balance gets really off, his balance pole turns red and he screams out \"Whoa\". If he remains in this position for more than a second, he falls off and it's over. Freddy has several tricks up his sleeve in this act: if Tony takes too long too cross, he pulls out a cannon and blasts him out of the way. In later levels, he flies around the tent and tries to push Tony off or throws saw blades at him. These can be deflected with the pole by pressing fire. Cannonball: Fernando, the Human Cannonball climbs into a cannon to be shot across the big top and hopefully land on his target. His assistant Lisa loads the cannon with a random amount of gun powder, which determines the thrust. Afterwards, the target must be placed somewhere along the tent, moving it closer or farther away depending on the amount of gun powder loaded. Once that is done, Lisa lights the fuse and the cannon starts rotating. It must be stopped at the right angle by pushing fire, which launches Fernando, hopefully towards the target and not the ground. Freddy comes into play when placing the target. Taking too long allows Freddy to put a giant cork into the cannon, with explosive results.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"173774":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"580cdd55-187e-4469-8e9e-fb154f04bf59.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"bb839581-7ff6-4a16-9274-67efdd89ced9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"13195166-dbc0-4b45-b03f-d725e7e6c883.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"6449ca24-194b-48b7-a41d-524752eac0b5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Footballer of the Year 2","Overview":"Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers. You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The action sequences involve studying a move plan on the chalkboard, then getting into the right position to execute the final shot. Fail to score enough goals and you may lose your place in the team; do especially well and you may gain a transfer up the league. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team. There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"173775":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"e8f02efb-4eb3-4b33-b30a-1621ad03af2f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"4d121b25-0941-4466-b651-a8a94c832b36.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"99377490-2145-4b16-80c3-25bbcdb35e07.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"34497732-f037-47a0-8557-130abae7f609.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7ade02f8-858b-4083-b6e9-f0ffca53fd3f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"524bba1d-ff44-44ff-bd5f-dde17e2cf3c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"dce8a154-097b-45d7-95c4-e6e33f734bd2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Formula 1 Simulator","Overview":"In this simulation you can race ten international circuits (only one for the C16), including traditional favourites such as Monza, Monaco and Silverstone plus no-longer-used circuits like Zandvoort and the Österreichring.

Dominique is held prisoner by the evil Salamandar, and Cobra, along with his cybernetic assistant Lady (or Harmanoid, as she's called in the game's French), must rescue her.\n\nYou start the game, and enter an isometric arena. You control both Cobra and Lady, each equipped with a gun. Shoot at everything that moves, and try to find the exit of the multidirectionally scrolling arena. As a backup weapon, you have also a set of five grenades to throw at troublesome enemies. Being hit once or twice is no problem, for you have a rather well-stocked energy bar. Controlling two characters at once means that you may be separated while rounding a corner or another obstacle, but the obstacles can also be used to regroup into a tighter or wider formation, depending on your choice of tactics.\n\nThis tie-in uses a high resolution, at the cost of colours, to animate the screen with a high detail. Sounds is quite minimal, with no in-game music and simple sound effects.

You (as the slightly dorky sounding 'Starion') had graduated from the space academy. I can't imagine a 'Space Academy' opening up sometime this year... Anyway - even though Starion was a green around the gills rookie, he had been given the one and only existing 'timeship'. Using this timeship you had to repair the damage that had been inflicted upon the space-time continuum by a bunch of evil aliens (no not Doc Brown or Marty McFly). So off you blasted into space and time to kill any enemy aliens crossing your path and righting whatever wrongs they had already perpetrated. The first part of this classic game was to patrol the outer regions of space and intercept and destroy any alien ships you happened to find. As you attacked and destroyed each enemy ship it would reform as a letter of the English alphabet. This letter had to be collected and stowed aboard your ship. When you had collected the required number of letters (after destroying a certain amount of enemies), you were asked to unscramble what you had and rearrange them to make a well known word that fitted some important period in history. Once unscrambled it was time to locate the entrance to a time warp and fly right into it, whereupon a time grid was displayed. Each grid had nine time zones and you had to decide which of the time zones contained the historical event that your cargo letters fitted (were it C-R-E-D-I-T you may have thought of the hopeless government in the late 2000's ;-)) If the cargo you recovered solved the correct 'puzzle' then you were rewarded with fresh fuel and oxygen which allowed you to fly off and solve the next time zone. If your cargo of letters did not fit the puzzle then you had to destroy more enemy ships within that zone which would give you enough fuel to escape and move to another zone to try again. All in all, Starion had 243 time zones to visit and solve - plenty to do before completing it! The graphical style in Starion was the gaming classic 'cockpit view', with instrument panels displaying details on speed, hull temperature, enemy location, pitch, role, yaw, fuel and oxygen levels. Scanners showed the location of other objects, (both horizontally and vertically), such as ships, mines, missiles and even space debris. Above the scanners the year of the current time zone was shown which was vital when trying to solve the time zone problems. The hull temperature was also vital to the game because the outside temperature increased as you travelled more quickly and also increased from excessive lazer fire. The hull could also be destroyed by direct hits from enemy weapons or collision with objects floating around in space (as you would imagine). In a twist for these types of games the general debris could not be destroyed and you had to avoid it. The top two thirds of the screen showed the 3D realm of space, with any objects, ships etc that were in visual range - all animated with nice fast and smooth moving vector graphics. Points were awarded in accordance with the speed at which the player completed each stage of the game - the faster you were the more you scored. You could acheive promotions depending on the number of time zones that you had solved. If you fancied easing the loneliness of outer space, a friend could join in for a bit of 2 player Starion action.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"175237":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"2b786d5b-4f8d-4068-98df-694905a3d727.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"397c2659-32ed-453c-abbb-5ac38eb9ec42.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Summer Games","Overview":"You’re an Olympic athlete competing in eight key events at the SUMMER GAMES.

Now, time has its importance, in the upper left corner of the screen, you will notice the presence of two pendulums: the one gives you the time elapsed, the other the duration of your actions. Better to act quickly, sometimes not too quickly anyway. Moreover, in Sram II, you have two lives: like what you do not have only enemies, a good mage having had the precaution of giving you a trowel which has the power to reconstitute you once before definitively admiring the specter of Death (in full dress: skeleton, scythe and everything and everything ...). Do not tempt the devil (he is smarter than you!) And do not force chance:\n\nVery classic, this game takes the \"look\" of Sram I. With even more beautiful graphics, even more finished and very colorful thanks to the use of various frames. Movements are always made by arrow keys and commands (actions) on the keyboard. The parser is in the same vein as Sram and has not lost his charming humor ...\n\nIn addition, classic and efficient, you have the possibility of saving a game in progress to resume it later. Very useful this option, if you feel a danger!\n\nAfter loading the presentation screen which in its animation takes both the style and the music of Sram I, the computer offers you to go on an adventure from the beginning or to reload one of the two parts that you have previously saved. (A choice between TWO saved games? We can not stop progress!) Small criticism, presentation and situation of the story are a bit long when you have to each time resume the game at the beginning ...\n\nA blush, Sram and it starts again!\n\nWill you be able to play the vengeful vigilantes properly, make a salutary \"cleaning\" in the city of Sram, find and kill Egrès IV (by avoiding the genocides which have bad effect) and that without losing your lives? In any case, Sram II is a game in its own right, well constructed, well made and full of its primary interest. The amateurs will appreciate, the others can let themselves be tempted ...","Publisher":"Ere Informatique"},"176050":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"df28a208-f4fc-4e54-b4a9-7b02854188e7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"abbac219-7476-447b-be72-38809d8065f7.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"adf06475-1212-49bd-96a4-b8d7f35d7116.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2586eaec-2df0-4c4f-88b3-f843284e8428.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0deff10b-c927-4676-8d0e-18f5726697a1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Tobruk 1942"},"176099":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"3f124e8a-3996-4a64-9e8a-d237bd59203e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"9162a8e3-9751-4306-8502-c94f00c49807.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"64095d4e-987b-4032-9d5f-eab0a8321e11.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"04f9cb30-0133-4851-8a6d-d5e6a751595b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7470efe0-1094-4a79-bd31-36c9c99187e8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7cb285eb-2356-413a-a5ff-9123939b4582.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"334437f8-2574-4e71-bb7c-ca34bac8ec21.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"453998a7-8dc8-4e79-b403-eaa2490b7ef8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Grand Prix Simulator 2","Overview":"A sequel to the previous Grand Prix Simulator, a popular Super Sprint style racing game.\n\nAs before, the action is viewed from overhead across a succession of tracks featuring hairpins, oil slicks and similar hazards.

Assisting you is your bodyguard\/minder Terry McCann, while the policeman Sgt. Chisholm is ready to fine you if he catches you with stolen goods. You start the game with two thousand pounds and some inventory in your storage locker. Some of the goods may have already been promised to someone, and just need to be delivered. Other goods are expected, but have yet to be collected from the supplier. Goods can be bought and sold by visiting individual sellers, or the Winchester pub where a variety of wheeler-dealer types hang out. Each character present at the time is represented graphically in the top half of the screen and is associated with a number. By pressing that number (quickly, as there is a time limit) you can initiate conversation with that character. If you fail to select a character before the time limit, a random character may start speaking with you. All dialogue involves buying items from them (using text commands like \"I WANT\", \"HOW MUCH\", \"OFFER\") or selling items to them. Once a deal has been agreed, the goods need to be moved. Your minder, Terry McCann can assist with this, and can be found at the Winchester, or in his flat (although he will tend to be uncooperative after working hours). He can be asked to collect or deliver items. If you are meeting with a dealer who might be upset with you because you have sold them poor quality merchandise, you can ask Terry to \"MINDER\" and he will accompany you to prevent violence (to you). Terry can also \"DUMP\" goods if they are stolen and you have the law breathing down your neck, so need to just get rid of them. You can tell goods are stolen because you will be questioned about them at odd times by Sgt. Chisholm. If he catches you with the goods at the storage locker, you will need to pay a hefty fine","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"176980":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c9ee5024-c889-4ce8-830a-539261c4ec6c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"80171b68-ef63-49cf-8fdf-d5e6b0ffc4b6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a855d031-6dd4-49ab-ab2d-07ebea655644.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5e529ff0-dd9b-4ca6-9dbf-a1e370a33f85.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ae30cc16-9872-4352-b7b7-73bc254108dd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f27108bb-c837-4646-89ed-dc8ae62c29dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Mindfighter","Overview":"The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. It’s set in a post-apocalyptic world of guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive use of the death penalty. Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state. Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.","Publisher":"Abstract Concepts","ReleaseYear":1988},"176981":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e45f47ca-06ae-4d63-8146-13d4d7df362a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c8573dbc-06e2-460d-8f92-c08fc0934e1b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f36b53ef-7b46-4fce-96ea-dd4c3450a78b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cd324147-a373-444e-ba7a-9b652bc93952.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08f9b5eb-d0aa-4f9b-93ae-b1f519b8f3c2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7b57e66a-7ed0-49c4-bb95-93309698a05b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5f9e5222-8f02-4a19-8dba-3747b7036ec4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40b39b96-1122-44ea-a4d9-4c3dd41258ec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Book of the Dead","Overview":"Life in the Other World was blissful for you, Kteth, a falcon headed Egyptian Godling, and your brothers and other Gods until your Father, Set decided to murder the great God Osiris to take his place.

The Time Lords have become aware of an evil force called The Master on the second moon of the planet Rijar taking over a mining base of the heatonite mineral to build a TIRU (Time Instant Reply Unit). A memory capsule on how to build a TIRU must be recovered and The Doctor must succeed as The Master plans to modify it by using The Doctor's brain to control both the past and future. The Doctor can jump, climb ladders, push buttons, and throw or use items.\n\nHe is accompanied by a robotic female cat named Splinx (who may remind you of the more famous K9 robot dog). The Doctor can only carry four items in his pockets, so Splinx is a valuable ally for fetching and carrying additional items. Even large items can fit in her dimensionally transcendental hyperspace load module. Splinx can also avoid proximity sensors and other creatures along with any items she carries. Occasionally, her energizer cells have to be recharged at external power points and the Doctor can place location markers to which she can find her way back to. Along the way, you will meet local peaceful Rijans who can be asked to perform simple tasks, and Cryostan plants which are used to make super-coolant fluid. There are also dangerous creatures called Madrags, as well as cyber guards to beware of.","Publisher":"Micro Power Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QhyXX1UpVmc"},"177079":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Touchdown USA"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"14fe3300-129b-4080-8d5c-ea24978cf63b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fa75b016-2e08-4df0-82ca-4ce531cbfedc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"0594fc5a-8f71-41c1-9d6b-7e335c6e88fe.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"8b9a63b6-95d2-4d2a-b8d5-0f366b5de8a2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"31db7cc3-fd51-4893-85fd-9b9255df1cd9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ad50ff3e-ca7e-4dbc-b1ec-bdbb514c11da.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"703d799e-3950-47bc-b02c-0702e8e3e851.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4f7ac0b0-7ed0-4a3d-afff-fd9f8ed74e89.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"87e45f4f-d25c-479f-9183-90d1eb8098f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2de1d892-65f2-466f-aac9-ac676de9f907.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Grid Iron","Overview":"Any American Football team is prepared to hire you, such is your skill.

Some of these attack, rather to my disappointment, sapped me right out of the game without warning. I suppose 1 should have known better than to annoy them!\n\nDuring a fight, the program enters a combat mode in which the lower half of the screen depicts two dice and displays and updates the relative skill and stamina of the opponents, giving a commentary on the details of the battle. When on land the adventurer can chicken out and run, by hitting X, but at sea the fight must go on to the bitter end. During the many times I played the game luck was nearly always on my side. I am told there is worse to come, eo perhaps it wasn't luck, but intended. However, I have never found computer 'lights'based on random numbers particularly credible, so I looked upon a fight as a somewhat risky way to obtain a trearure or find a bidden exit.\nSailing the seas can be interesting, for as well as finding land to explore, there are wrecks to be plundered and respectable ships to be burned and looted, not to mention skirmishes with other ships.\n\nBut all is not looting, pillaging and plundering – there are some real problems as well! What do the sea Sprites want? What i the best way to defeat a zombie? Aha, and there's \"the traditional red-herring in there somewhere, too' Mike Woodroffe told me!\n\nAll this combines with excellent graphics to make a very good adventure, easy enough to get into – but it's not so simple to tie things up on the mountain top!","Publisher":"Adventure International","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"177121":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"a5711bd2-3067-47dc-8b13-6068133b2d82.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"3abb3ddd-0e8e-4f41-a9ed-d4101dc2d68b.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"8c9fcbd4-313b-41b2-84f1-364523eb0ff7.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04242616-5312-4b06-91b5-90e34f5ec36f.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c8e9313b-0a8f-4e5b-865a-ab89b896a957.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Ormuz","Overview":"Although it could initially be interesting and quite affordable, this submarine simulator, with very few keys and an almost impossible objective, was surpassed by contemporary launches in the field of simulation.

At the outset of each level, the world you must free is shown briefly before it is blacked out. Take careful note of this, as you will not get another look at the entire level until it is completed. By travelling over the square sectors that make up each chequered world you can illuminate it. When all the squares have been illuminated, the exit square for that level flashes and must be reached before the time limit expires to teleport to the next world. Counters at the bottom of the screen display time remaining and how many squares still need to be revealed to complete the level. To make things more difficult, some squares are 'dead ends' and unlit squares beyond cannot be reached unless an alternative route is found. Another problem is represented by the marauding aliens that patrol each level intent on destroying your work. While patrolling each planet they black out the squares you have uncovered, making it necessary for you to return and uncover it again before the level can be completed. If you come into contact with an enemy a life is lost. Similarly, if you become trapped on a 'dead end' square, your only alternative is to commit suicide. As the game progresses, more alien enemies are introduced and the hidden paths for each level become more difficult to negotiate. Points are awarded for revealing squares, with a bonus given upon the completion of each level, and additional points awarded for time remaining.","Publisher":"Mastertronic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"177151":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"43a66c78-f131-4cf0-8f9f-485a6e71a7bc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"b71f9d2c-ab1a-4a04-9403-3c80b4f928e1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"6860cf86-c65e-4d38-8945-a9b11c8469da.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8cc1793e-d2da-4ef1-abcb-e1c4bd301746.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"702961fc-e3c1-41dd-a4a3-a943084a8bd5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"6de19991-415e-47d8-b2ed-e87b9227be2c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rugby Coach","Overview":"Rugby League is a form of rugby popular in the North of England and the game Rugby Coach allows you to manage a team and take them from Division 2 and win the Division1 title as well as various cups.

At that time in the Earth's history a terrible plague known as the Nagroma, swept the land at the start of winter killing every living thing it encountered. With the aid of the Inovar the Eharin were able to create a protective barrier that kept the plague at bay. However the barrier, the Cairnrue, did not just keep the plague at bay, it stopped everything, so every spring the Rite of Decairn had to be performed to allow rain to fall. This rite has been performed for many years by Varwield Arthermin who has grown old and bitter. The last time he raised the Cairnrue, Arhermin tried to keep its power for himself. He was defeated by Kiron the Protector in a great battle during which a shard was split from the great stone of Inovar. Kiron took the stone and fled over the Adklaart Mire where, it is rumoured, he is now trapped by Arthermin's soldiers. Arthermin kept the shard and used its power to create the Naslava, creatures from the Earth's core, to protect him. This brought him into conflict with Rimarlion, Daughter of the Earth, whom he defeated and turned to stone. Before her fall Rimarlion entrusted her sacred amulet to the Laryx people of Mount Hiakron who in turn entrusted it to Sunquat, Leader of the Eharin, People of the Light. The player enters the game as Varwield Secunda, chosen by your people to serve under Arthermin as his apprentice. For years you have served him but now, as storm clouds gather and the rainfall is absorbed by the Cairnrue, the time has come for the Rite of Decairn to be performed and that task falls on your shoulders. Shard of Inovar a multi-platform, icon driven, text adventure game with graphics. It can be played with a keyboard or with a joystick. Instead of typing in 'Go North', 'Get item' and so on the player selects an appropriate icon from the panels that are above, below, and at either side of the screen. Another helpful feature is the 'Give item to person' icon which, when invoked, allows the player to select an item from the inventory and then highlights words from the last displayed piece of text for the player to select. This allows the player to select a person from their group without the need to spell all their names correctly every time.","Publisher":"Bulldog","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"177207":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciel","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Vehicle Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"8b77f25c-80a8-485e-bae0-0cbb607227c4.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0d1f440f-1cd0-46e7-a5a8-a98d05d43ac4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c07ded3e-24ac-4bc2-a49b-3b52b83c8305.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3a8828b6-1959-40ce-907b-fa4a174b5c82.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7581d33b-c34c-4141-8b74-967b56c46429.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"afe46880-7c59-48ae-b4a7-2b0d6d7ffbad.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"369334ba-be58-4bb9-b6a5-e2ea097b63f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0d6afc9e-ffef-490d-a541-98344a3f91b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Sherman M4","Overview":"Sherman M4 is a 3D tank simulator.

With your brush you slide the pieces of the poster by a full row or a full column so forward planning is required. In the bottom right corner is a sign for the toilet and if you press down you can see what the poster should look like, a press of the fire button shows the poster with the grid on it and finally another press of the fire button and you see what the poster is looking like at that moment. As you move the pieces around the screen you have to avoid missiles being thrown at you by Norville's henchmen and if you are hit by one you lose one of five lives.

At the end of each level there is a final boss that must be defeated.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177297":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"15aa838d-4607-4102-b04d-8de60767d8af.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e0c8367d-f26e-4d09-9a75-125ad9c520f2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"63515e04-d44d-41d5-b013-ab59acd72e91.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5da8d08d-d0a6-44ba-91ed-b77f01ff5dc2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a36ce739-5f8d-4da9-a218-42f45e2b1e15.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"7a3797f4-0802-4f07-92eb-3fb457cafe4f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c2d571fb-5fc6-4608-9f58-5b929b5f537e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Heroes of the Lance","Overview":"Based on the later parts of the Dragonlance book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the heroes descend into a ruined city in search of the disks of Mishakal.

Over the years you desperately hoped for someone to come and rescue you but no one came. Now, a fully grown adult, you have escaped from your captors and have returned to claim your kingdom.\n\nThe adventure starts with you in a chapel on the outskirts of Hamil. To leave by the way you entered is sudden death. Another exit is sought and found and you are now within striking distance of what you have dreamed of for all those years. All you have to do is prove that you are worthy of your inheritance. The puzzles are ingenious and I suppose must be accepted as fairly logical. A major problem is to get the parser to understand what you are trying to do. As with many games in the classical mould, the vocabulary is not very large and the way in which you can input commands is strictly limited.\n\nExtensive hints are supplied for those faint hearted enough to require them, but I am pleased to say that they are, on the whole, only hints. You still have to interpret them for them to be useful. The hint sheet supplied with the game has a list of potential areas of difficulty listed as objects and locations. Each has a number that can be referred to elsewhere. This gives you a number to type into the computer and you will then receive a clue.\n\nYou may then ask for another on the same subject and the answers you get will be clearer the longer you persist. Some hints may appear to be quite explicit but you then have to decide how to input this new found knowledge, and that may not be so easy. Kingdom of Hamil does not have an enormous number of locations but there are plenty of puzzles to solve. Whether you manage it on your own or with the help of the clues provided, you will still feel satisfied when you reach the climax of the adventure. The problems you meet are not in themselves an entirely believable part of the plot but nevertheless provide a stimulating experience in adventuring. There is no RAM SAVE, but SAVEs to disc are rapid and should be made quite frequently as sudden death is around every corner. The instructions omit reference to any common commands, RESTORE must be used to re-load a SAVEd game position and the adventurer's favourite command EXAMINE is not recognised at all. This seems a strange omission but once you get used to its absence you just read the text more carefully.","Publisher":"Topologika","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"177342":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"9455c35a-1291-4ccf-a33f-e4e18a9c6a07.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"10bdcab2-b4c9-4c78-9f3b-d4eac8fda5b3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a96cb297-4a8d-466e-9eda-ef76e3093e04.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2cfbf696-8671-4ffb-a8dc-27a2285318a6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bd5f0669-f848-44c0-a4dc-958ff9b60a3f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c0667126-c1ba-490d-afa8-fb5b00595971.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"823f7d4a-95f3-4281-bd8e-847b566e0768.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c64ac0a1-6c15-4b30-8a93-416a4a001891.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Protector","Overview":"Protector is a split-screen horizontal side-view shooter where one or two players try to carry supplies to their base before bombing the other players base to win the game.

They are controlled using the space and return keys, so young children should be able to play with little support. Most games have multiple difficulty levels, which reveal themselves after the easiest has been solved.\n\nIf Teddy's friend is to climb the tree successfully, you must recognise which of the items in front of you can be paired up. Initially there are 6, rising to 18 as you get them right. The Gallery game involves matching pictures with the correct label, with more and more options as the game difficulty increases. In the actions game you must choose an action word and watch Teddy act it out.\n\nTo help teddy get up the steps to his beloved honey, you must correctly count the numbers of everyday objects such as teddies, trees and clouds on a screen. The Letters game takes place at the fair - matching the letters displayed will earn your Teddy an ice cream. Parents may wish to offer the same reward to their children, but should watch out for E numbers. The colouring module is less a game and more an experiment in design - choose the colours of each item to form a picture."},"177391":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"bbc24835-bbad-4a5a-b10c-4212e72ee44a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"fe3816c4-6aae-4360-a428-7cee8296790f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fc0d2656-4a3e-4f10-bc5a-991e5ee854e5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e0739a6a-834e-48d8-8505-77f2fff6daaf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"75a9dc5f-dad1-453e-824d-ff16f4682a94.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3a3689af-76eb-4328-bb17-2ce241ec4a35.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a77f6e42-1b2f-47c0-bb62-cc81c6a16407.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Kentilla","Overview":"Kentilla is a text adventure with graphics.

In the game of the film of Tom Clancey’s novel, Marko Ramius – commander of Russia’s most powerful nuclear submarine, The Red October – has been tempted by the West’s good life and he’s going in his sub! The Russians are a bit annoyed about this ad decide to sink him. However, Ramius does get some help from CIA operative Jack Ryan who sets up a plan to sneak the sub into the US. Meanwhile, the October’s chef, Loginov, is missing his vodka and caviar and gets angry enough to threaten to explode the sub’s nuclear warheads unless it turns around. At the end, Jack will have a final chance to save the day in a Cabal-style screen, taking pot shots at the chef who dodges between the warheads, returning fire. Game’s standard movie approach, using a familiar main game-style with a couple of sub-games recreating key scenes has been copied by Grandslam to little effect. Unambitious horizontal sub sections but the 3-D for the helicopter drop and mini-sub scenes is fast and well executed. Sound consists of variety of atmospheric tunes, but weak rendition of movie soundtrack. The Hunt for Red October: The Movie Amiga game veers towards high difficulty in places, with an amazingly restrictive sub section, and then throws in some attractively done but laughably simple 3-D sequences. If you want a game of the film then buy the game of the book – far better FMV.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"177570":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Black System","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0e683bf0-2fd5-4dcb-8b0d-7348fe66cd86.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9ba8099e-7477-43eb-a6c5-636d3f1358d8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a0bd29d8-29ab-4829-b827-05d995712a51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Cosmos","Overview":"A spacecraft from another galaxy is on an exploration mission in the infinite cosmos.

To make matters even worse, The Enemy are on the brink of completing research for atomic capabilities and when finished will finally end the war for the Allies. Many attempts have been made to destroy the research centre but all have failed as it's at the end of a heavily guarded inlet under a mountain. You, the Captain of The Undaunted are the nations last hope as you attempt to sail down from your base, sail across the sea, sail down the inlet before attempting to destroy the research centre. The game starts with a map of The Homeland showing the position of both sides bases, aircraft and ships. You must select your aircraft icons and select targets to attempt to destroy with more damage making the passage for your ship easier. Once you have attacked then the computer attacks your icons and any damage inflicted puts that icon out for one to two turns. Once all attacks have been made by both sides then various types of arcade sequences start as you make your way to your target. Complete an arcade sequence and you go back to the map to attack the computer once again. The arcade sequences are either viewed from above or a 1st person perspective. The above view ones have you controlling your ship and two escort boats, and you must shoot down planes while avoiding bombs, torpedoes or mines. You can steer your ship to avoid the various weapons and if you hold the fire button down you control a sight to shoot the planes but you can't control the ship. The 1st person sequences have you trying to shoot various ships by firing shells from your guns. You have to lower or lift the guns up and down to find the range for your shells while the enemy ships fire back at you. Your ship has a damage meter and everytime you are hit then it increases and if it reaches 100% then it is game over. Once you have made it to the research centre you now face the centre from a 1st person perspective and you have to destroy by firing shells through the doors as they close. If they shut then you have lost and the war is over."},"178552":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"94809c88-055a-484a-80f9-623a29abfa11.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef4ac974-54f8-43ea-a151-72e535475d2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8357cf64-5baa-45ea-84ce-af97a210dfde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Deathchase","Overview":"The player controls a motorcycle-riding mercenary as he pursues two other motorcycles, one blue and one yellow, through a forest.

The reserves are maintained by aura energy generators, buried deep below the ground. Unfortunately the Star Cygnis Alpha has gone supernova.

Blocks of three parts forming a vertical line drop down and each part can have a different colour. The player needs to stack the blocks to create a line of three identical colours or more, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The pieces cannot be rotated, but the order of the colours can be changed while the block is falling.\n\nThe Levels mode consists of fifteen levels. It tells the tale of a Princess Genara who is locked in a pyramid. The player has to free her by moving through rooms, removing stone by stone. The closer to the princess, the faster the stones will fall as the player progresses through the levels. There is a time limit that is carried across the levels. A timer constantly counts down and a certain score needs to be reached to progress to the next room. Extra seconds are earned by making a match of more than three blocks and a large amount is also provided at the start of each new room. When time runs out, the entire mode needs to be restarted from room one. After each cleared room a results screen is shown with the door leading to the next room.\n\nThere is also an Arcade mode where a certain number of stones need to be removed before time runs out or until the field is entirely filled up. The three remaining modes are endless modes because on the difficulty levels easy, normal and expert.\n\nThis game was released as both a physical copy, and a free digital download.","Publisher":"CEZ Games Studio","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2004,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0BDWneIbkU8"},"178587":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"96c9d21a-f468-43fb-94c9-f166420f5559.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"97131946-0bbf-43d4-8cc5-6b317ee68f57.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a12806c8-b0a9-460a-8efb-a8aa277bf262.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"35ccc4e2-2530-4453-a558-38d978c5a937.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0bee2449-0086-477b-97bd-2451f21c666a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"e3875669-c705-41ed-ba71-c7f8cee1b73f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"619d0b7c-ee28-42b3-a58e-ae6b5565f26d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fe2400d3-fc14-4775-ba66-171ef0327100.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Hawk Storm","Overview":"Hawk Storm is a brave warrior living on the planet Edos, and its citizens look up to him for survival. Edos has only one source of energy: the giant capacitoid crystals, capable of storing energy by day and regenerate that energy during the icy cold nights. Having realized this, the evil Nevik warriors decided to steal all but two of these crystals, making it impossible to sustain normal life on the planet. As a result, all of the people are forced to go in a Life Suspension Program, except Hawk, who must recover all thirty-two stolen crystals if Edos is to survive. The Neviks are scattered throughout Edos to make sure that Hawk does not succeed in his quest, but Hawk can collect up to three different weapons – shields, mines, and stryders – that can be used against them. Also scattered around are various hazards such as firepits, slimeballs, spikes, and gun turrets, which can cause Hawk to lose some energy if he collides into them. There are several objects which Hawk can use to his advantage. Energy pods can restore his energy, lifts can be used to reach higher platforms, and teleports can take him to different areas.","Publisher":"Players","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"178591":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"458769cd-2569-4c6e-9bdd-80346cdffc98.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"47462c72-2fef-4c2a-b823-f77606e3f097.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4bbb7379-11d9-48e1-a7d4-fcd5161dc4f6.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"316726b9-9f57-4e2d-8492-8114595d85cf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"11706c22-ecd9-42f7-91f6-f1e794763f0e.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6fbf2479-8cf5-4db8-9833-64865b8b46c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a59abaa0-9bf1-405d-9ab7-f43adfb1d70a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Duel 2000","Publisher":"Coktel Vision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"178593":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"000b3289-32eb-4d46-9dcc-a71dbe44e328.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d6f792e6-0822-478b-9b6f-75a474dc30f2.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"597a0c77-62e4-41bd-bb59-2f9653be338e.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"d7c9d2db-c5ad-4419-b3ed-349d795269dc.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Cart - Front"}],"Name":"Electric Wonderland","Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseYear":1986},"178596":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"72a1a553-6089-4156-8bdf-8bea251a5df6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Battle Beyond the Stars","Publisher":"Solar Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985},"178638":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Fire & Forget II: The Death Convoy","Region":"United States"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Titus France","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"39b2da13-9349-440b-882b-b9f851733b95.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"14c02b65-7dbd-4eb8-937c-9d03614a0986.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fire & Forget II","Overview":"Part two in the Fire and Forget series, best described as Crazy Cars (also by Titus) with weapons in a futuristic setting.

It offers five disciplines, which can be either played separately or linked together as tournament: 100 Meter Slither: Players take control over a worm and have to race by making rhythmic and fast joystick movements. But because the worm uses up his slime for movement, players occasionally have to slow down to avoid burning dry. Space Hockey is a one-against-one hockey game. It features a living puck which tries to stay out of the goals and for rounds of 60 seconds each. Psychic Judo: Here two beings with over sized brains shoot energy bolts at each other. Since there can be only one bolt at the screen at a time, so the faster player goes into attack mode and the other goes into defense: The defender can rise (and move) shields while the attacker needs to steer the bolt around them. If a bolt hits the unprotected defender, it transfers energy from the defender to the attacker - or vice versa if it hits a shield. This discipline is played best-of-five with 60-second rounds, Head Throwing is basically a normal hammer throwing event. Players need to gain speed by making rhythmic and fast joystick movements and release the head at the right moment to throw it as far as possible. Metamorph Marathon: Here players need to navigate an obstacle race again the clock. They control a metamorph which can be morphed into five different shapes with different advantages and disadvantages. This means one of the player's task is to decide which form is best suited for which part of the course and to balance the energy reserves.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseYear":1987},"178779":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"faf53293-0aa4-4645-916e-36e564fd104d.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"e759b578-053c-4633-9afc-88712fea597a.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ff0f6160-5791-40eb-a15c-8b1daf3e73dc.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"120ea823-eee2-44c6-8dfb-a0a68fe5492e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ae2c6a3d-0b84-4a31-b04b-92e2e73a46c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fusion 2","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"178780":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b820ae10-a62c-4cda-aba9-fff4938c66bd.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"c15c4ba6-c3aa-4f0c-bfd6-ad8629d5c9be.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2b683d4a-e03d-469a-a76b-9127fde99dcc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"7a98678e-69f1-4715-a9a5-1034daa62077.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8ddd5141-e532-48e4-84f6-e61ce2a21579.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"017bce6a-e9fc-4098-919e-009c45fc36e4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7a59e87e-ac17-489c-8124-ef4425d3d950.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a1dac9e-21a0-4942-91b5-0c2c8e7a0f2e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9a5a1c58-13d5-4d44-afa5-43fdf9ccaefd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f984ff22-3ca1-4e8d-985c-63fab3a86008.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"739e5bcc-f5da-4eca-803d-88de0d22024d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ab2b9e2a-b760-46ea-8cef-37c5f47a52a6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"01cbcfb7-31c9-4379-9a1a-333348fe3b8c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b608e5d9-2c99-4eb8-94ba-9e6ced2c074a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"820ef674-6cc4-4e52-a481-e411d0e15ace.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cf70a068-6e16-404a-86d6-a2c980ef2418.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Frankenstein","Overview":"I am Doctor Victor Frankenstein.

Players take the role of nobles in the Holy Roman Empire and compete for the crown of the emperor. One to nine players can play, beginning by entering their name and gender and being assigned a state in the empire. Gameplay then takes place in turns, each consisting of a number of consecutive screens. In the first screen, players can sell and buy grain and land. Grain is necessary to feed a noble's subjects. Bad weather can result in harvest losses, making it necessary to buy extra grain to prevent starvation. Providing more grain than necessary increases population growth and the state's reputation. Acquiring more land increases population and is necessary for economic growth. Following the trading screen is a statistics screen, displaying births and deaths, immigration and emigration as well as income and expenses. The third screen allows control of income. Players can set taxes and tariffs and can determine how harshly the justice system works - setting it to a level that is too brutal might increase income in the short term but also lead to increased emigration. Another overview screen follows, displaying a player's lands and properties in detail. The fifth screen allows for spending the turn's income. It is possible to buy marketplaces and grain mills (both of which increase income) as well as construct part of a palace or a cathedral (both of which have no direct use but are required to move into the highest levels of nobility). Each building option requires owning a certain amount of land. Constructing five marketplaces and three mills results in the creation of a city.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"178814":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"e411b93b-eb20-4524-93fb-eca850d83b15.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Killer Gorilla","Overview":"Killer Gorilla is a clone of Donkey Kong written by Adrian Stephens and originally published by Micro Power for the BBC Microcomputer in 1983 and ported to the Acorn Electron and Amstrad CPC computers in 1984.

Two teams of five players compete on an ovoid circuit. The ten killermen move on roller skates. A ball is thrown in the arena, and our ten players will try to take possession of it. Therefore, the game consists in placing the ball in the opposing goal represented by two diametrically opposite holes. It is obvious that the player in possession of the ball must avoid the attackers of the opposing team, because the latter will not give him any gifts. Feet, fists, knees will be part of the celebration. To score a goal, it is sufficient that a team does not lose the ball during a complete lap of the circuit. From then on, a small orange light lights up to indicate the opening of the hatch which will serve as a goal.","Publisher":"Microids","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"178830":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"eed1ffa9-24ed-4b5e-a896-cdd39bca520d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"698743b8-a4c0-4175-a46b-28a6a71250f6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a450a8ce-3fc5-49a2-9b34-15aaf676892b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"26971a24-d5d9-44ea-b1a9-f42e0cc4c7ab.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"a7e1039e-a515-4845-bb99-065afb46923e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"32a0d291-5560-4937-a720-ba0df11bc8f4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"53a506c4-5d24-4197-8417-9e568bd3f858.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"962132f1-5201-4e00-8714-4de54d886dd8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"908e855d-42f0-4f2a-8458-4d7b618f1fe5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9d3ff645-f920-467f-ae4f-34bff3ff3a2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Master Chess","Overview":"The ancient game of chess is recreated here, with all the traditional rules and game concepts.

The bangs and whistles, the panache and the cuteness, the occasional fiendish difficulty and the pathologically infectious theme tune are all there in spades.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2011},"179221":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ba223ead-de9f-4437-837b-85f3810ed1f2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"77b8a664-7810-4dcf-afbd-c0e038a939dc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"7f745d9c-d953-4f0d-9bb8-df68bf5355ff.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"36899dc7-7316-4bdb-a1ae-a82c9b3e4cea.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5ddd1dbb-7778-4718-893f-ea9d192a25d8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"155e498b-3991-471e-9ddb-8517e3396b5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ac4694a4-3135-452c-9b89-734325fc8f1c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Helter Skelter","Overview":"Remember when computer games were fun?

Most of the major characters from the book appear, including Adrian's warring parents and their respective flings, his sweetheart Pandora, his best mate Nigel, school bully Barry Kent, and curmudgeonly pensioner Bert Baxter. The game didn't use many typed commands. You would read passages of text (many of them from the book) and be given 3 choices as to what to do, which would lead to other events unfolding. You could also use a help option which would display information about characters featured in the diary. Your aim throughout all of this was to make Adrian as popular as possible. The player's score and ranking is displayed at particular times during the game.

Runner, completing each course before time runs out. There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line. Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path. Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.

Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens. Up to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination. Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads. Each location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent). When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours. Apparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.","Publisher":"Loriciel","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"179505":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"6f4cdbda-4685-4fc5-b6af-a874b0b44d62.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ff951982-13f6-4d89-90f2-b934b4b308d0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Professional Ski Simulator","Overview":"Players have to guide a skier down the piste in the specified time limit.

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul)."},"179510":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Summer Games 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"b6e72f72-35a8-4faa-b8b3-38f567b5f76f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6e716ee4-2c95-48f0-8bc8-01795f0f6836.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Summer Games II","Overview":"Eight Olympic events feature in this game, and any selection of these can be played at a time.

I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar. For the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults will see you disqualified. Fencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, retreating when appropriate.

Off course the locals don't appreciate you coming to their home and stealing from them so they will chase you and throw spears at you. You need to search the island and find a sword and shield but the sword is hidden in one of the many huts so they need burning down to find it. A torch is required but that is too high on a building so a ladder will need finding to get the torch.\n\nOnce you have the sword you can throw an infinite amount at the locals and the shield will slow down your energy bar from decreasing when you are hit. If your energy does reach zero then it is a loss of one of your five lives. On your voyage to the island you damaged the mast to your ship so you need to find the three parts to it by burning the huts and searching the rest of the island. Once found you can now sail to Death Island. Don't sail too far from the island though as you will sail over the edge of the world and it's game over. Once you have reached Death Island you must destroy a protective wall before heading north to the fortress and plundering it's wares. Be careful as the locals here are faster and throw more spears.\n\nThe Vikings is a Run 'n Gun game where you view your Viking from behind at an elevated angle.

As an alien movie mega-star, he always had fans, but this time they were uncontrollable. They jumped on his back, embraced him, kissed him, tore his clothes... it was terrible. Humphrey finished in hospital with all kinds of contusions and a nervous crisis that him left postrated in bed for several months. When he recovered, he bought a new mansion to get more privacy. Unfortunately the building was only half finished. And the decorator had painted all the rooms exactly the wrong colour. Well if you want a job done right... Humphrey is a top-down maze game, where you control the titular character and must visit every square in the 40 levels of his incomplete house to paint them the correct colour. Complicating matters are fans who infest the premises, and whose touch will turn the now socially anxious Humphrey completely insane. Fortunately, Humphrey can make frenzied leaps of terror over his fans. But when he lands he must also contend with special squares which are electrified, teleporters, bombs and various others.","Publisher":"Zigurat Software","ReleaseYear":1988},"179736":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Coktel Vision","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform; Puzzle; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"ea5c1519-6002-4dd3-b92d-8329e0713dca.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9a60cbad-ecad-4a55-a79e-71fc3b0aef5b.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"a7cfd387-914a-4a50-82c8-800dc17bf227.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"462950fe-f753-4523-aaf8-f75ffe840aa9.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"171d8be8-1d7a-44e9-8341-6df2cc90502b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"78fc2c1f-a1b9-46f2-892b-71e59cfb3c86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lucky Luke: Nitroglycerine","Overview":"This multi-genre game is based on the famous comics series about Lucky Luke, a good cowboy who draws his gun and shoots quicker than his shadow.

You were chosen to protect the quality of the line and to do not give it away to the competitor. In the beginning, Lucky Luke should move around the town and find out the bandits preventing him from travel on the train. During arcade shooting he should shoot all of them on the streets and inside the saloon. After train stops in front of the boulder on the rails, Lucky Luke has to find the way to this boulder to blow it up with a bomb collecting the useful items and using them in adventure mode. During these actions he'll encounter four Daltons and Apache's leader. The next trial is a puzzle, where Lucky Luke has to connect the branch lines for the train switching the points on the railway. And the last one is to solve the problem of water between Comanches and the Ranch owners in the place where quality will be checked finally.","Publisher":"Cedic Vifi","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/3lwCuTkydVw"},"179739":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"ff81f98b-13b5-4ceb-aa61-77e12bcfece4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fa86ba8b-f053-44d1-b503-c9a5c07f8bc0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"c0271909-7073-4846-9b68-69852088a810.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"179f1cb4-5645-447f-80e4-7ff272de5aa4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"63291106-7b4f-4ea9-9593-3413345a72ff.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"85e94bf7-5a6f-43eb-9964-cd7c6a42d63b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"91225a66-2d0c-4875-90f4-925ab4c46c6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Magic Johnson's Basketball","Overview":"Magic Johnson's Basketball is a decent arcade-style basketball game starring LA Lakers' superstar Magic Johnson, one of the most famous players of all time. It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode. As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation. When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game. But basketball fans simply have many better choices to choose from than this game.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseYear":1990},"179740":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"f2438a12-7ae5-49d0-bea2-0d7d7a9af1ff.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0d9090e1-8011-4dd3-857e-c70648fdf8bd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"64f4eb6f-383f-49b6-9e84-7a8be9fd2221.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d8c249a2-7e5f-4af6-b060-62a6a20e1bca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bce92a14-a7b2-47d0-8e44-7ed64de71551.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Magic Sword","Publisher":"Database Software","ReleaseYear":1984},"179742":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"2fd82635-02a0-4b58-bf3a-1cf23bcf43e7.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Stop Ball"},"179745":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3b4f8826-034a-4ad4-98c3-4b7ec7b327b1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Strangeloop Plus"},"179747":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"bf43d236-3481-4443-9f31-5f21cb5e3d3d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d55c051c-ee8c-4027-8656-d9620eba9e99.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b08385bd-df6a-4f6a-9fb4-9d27f622926c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Striker","Overview":"You are a 18 year old striker playing for a team in the English 4th Division and your aim is to help your team get promoted to the 1st Division and win domestic and European trophies or move to other teams as you work your way up in a career that will end at age 34.

You now have the ability to fly and you have a Super Punch which knocks-out the criminals with one punch. You must explore three parts of the city stopping the criminals but also finding and rescuing girls on top of the roof-tops and taking them back home. There are also Grannys to escort from the Library to their home. Be careful not to touch the Grannys or you will kill them.

If you hit a criminal, get shot, have a granny or girl killed then your Crimewave Overload meter rises and if it reaches the top then you lose one of three lives. If you punch a criminal or rescue a girl or granny then the meter decreases. Once you have completed three levels then you repeat them but this time at night with more people to rescue and with more criminals and faster ones.

Certain objects have special uses (e.g. keys open certain doors), and there is a puzzle element to the game to discover how some of these objects relate to the world in order to help the player solve the game. In addition to carrying objects, they could also be stacked on top of each other to enable Isvar to climb up to rooms above him or to reach important objects perched high above on platforms. There are also a number of secret areas in the castle that are not visually obvious to the player and can only be discovered through exploration. During Isvar's exploration of the castle he is accosted by its guards and monsters - trolls, monks, guards, tornadoes, man-eating plants, bubbles, etc. all of which weaken Isvar's energy. The castle also contains food and magical potions which will restore his health.

The player can choose between the 'armchair cricket' mode where the game supplies names for all team members, or the 'personal team selection' mode where the player enters their own teams names.\n\nAt the start of the game the player is presented a cricket pitch, on which the bowler, the wicket keeper together and two opposing batsmen are already positioned. The player then positions nine fielders around the pitch ready for the first over. Fielders are placed by moving the fielder icon around the pitch with the arrow keys and pressing 'Fire' when the player is in the correct position.\n\nBowling: Before any over commences the player selects the type of bowler, this can be fast, medium, spin, or bouncer. Once this is done the player presses the 'Fire' key and the game positions the bowler behind the wicket, he takes a run up and delivers a ball. This is repeated until the over is complete.\n\nBatting: In a single player game the computer will start as the batting team. When the player is batting they must select where they wish to hit the ball that's just been bowled. This is done by holding down the 'Fire' key while pressing the numeric keys to select a direction. Directions can be changed at will right up until the time the 'Fire' key is released. The ball should be struck at the last possible moment for maximum strength.\n\nFielding: Once the ball has been batted the player has the chance to select a fielder to chase the ball to try to prevent it reaching the boundary. If the ball touches the running fielder or any of the stationary fielders, it is either caught or thrown at the wicket to attempt to run the batsman out. Fielders may be repositioned at the start of each over. Dismissal appeals for, say leg-before-wicket (LBW), is not automatic as appeals may be rejected by the umpire.","Publisher":"Tynesoft","ReleaseYear":1985},"180021":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8328f61d-544a-4f3a-adeb-45365755e33a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45153c7a-79b0-46b0-9839-9df510e4b0ff.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"69822beb-374f-46af-a5b2-14008672f5f3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a3fec863-eed2-48c1-9cc8-508de1b38fac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"14ce8d39-ba93-4497-8d72-902b3863a1f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c8f466b3-7d50-45aa-87dc-5c914f68a137.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Ingrid's Back","Overview":"Ingrid is Ingrid Bottomlow, the intellectual-but-clumsy gnome we met in Gnome Ranger.

You have been sent to the Interchange, a highly sensitive area, which has been invaded by Victor Virus and his gang of bugs. On 50 circuits they have changed the direction of some of the blocks on each circuit and your task is to straighten them all back up. Viewed from above with each circuit shown on screen you must walk along the circuits to the misaligned pieces and turn them back round to the correct position and a ping sounds when it is in the correct position.\n\nAs you sort the circuit some of Victor's bugs roam the circuits as well and you can either avoid them, shoot them with limited balls or turn a piece of circuit round when they are next to it to destroy them. Once all the bugs have been destroyed they don't reappear. If you touch a bug, fall through a gap or fall of the edge of the circuit then you lose one of five lives and when all lives are gone it is game over. There is a password provided after every five levels to stop you repeating too many circuits. There is also a clock counting down and the circuit must be completed within the time. Occasionally some items appear to help you and these are extra balls, smart bomb, shield (limited), extra speed, freeze all bugs, extra time and stop timer.","Publisher":"Hi-Tec Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"180023":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"D&H Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"1f5be74e-577f-4bfc-8273-a48efe485347.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"545657a4-9d33-4b87-b46c-763003ee15b7.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cfaf20e4-eb10-4989-8146-d142ec7acdac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"ebb256a2-aab2-4f7d-8423-606412bc1a5c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7544ac3b-db2f-4328-ae4f-48314e297265.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b154f2db-6502-49c2-8391-80b76162af53.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"308761f6-be90-4c50-aca9-f8e790555e93.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"88cf1efa-5ff7-466f-b78a-9de2601d06d2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6ac75dd4-4ad3-4e7d-8fe4-b4ec76055cd3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"International Football","Overview":"International Football is a management game allowing you to participate in the World Cup with a choice of 32 teams from around the world.

Bearing these in mind one wonders whatever possessed the Hi-Tec peeps to release this with the word ‘game’ anywhere on the disk or packaging. Fair enough it does pass the time, but then so does a party political broadcast. This, not to put too fine a point on it, is pretty tedious stuff indeed. Initial impressions are more favourable, however. You can’t deny The Jetsons looks pretty much like you’d expect Hanna-Barbera’s family of second- string cartoon characters to look, but decent-enough- cartoony-graphics is about as far as its list of good points goes. To be honest, the list of bad points is equally short - there’s no gameplay to speak of here at all. All that happens is, one after another, members of our 1950s-style space family explore a boring space-age maze, dodging dull traps and picking up the odd even-more-boring collectables. Obviously Hi-Tec thought that the graphics and animation were ample to sell this as a ‘game’ and, indeed, I dare say they’ll sell quite a few on the name alone. Don’t let one of them be you - not least because they’ve got the cheek to charge a distinctly un-budget thirteen quid for it.","Publisher":"Hi-Tec Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"180025":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c632ea06-427f-4f53-ac91-4bc7553c8ff3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Coliseum","Publisher":"Topo Soft","ReleaseYear":1988},"180026":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"000b2ed0-6ffc-4baf-993c-3ef5ed4e4795.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Beta 2515","Publisher":"Amstrad Games"},"180028":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"07094f66-3b4c-4f82-86e4-7ba5853cf8b7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"5922dba7-f579-418f-b7c9-6b95510700db.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fb6a6b38-731a-414f-88eb-8f874c5bddfe.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"055a0723-dc0c-465b-8c27-c10777e83d83.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"373cefc3-2c0b-4a16-82ea-7afedc331e50.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"66d06f49-b1bf-4d85-ace7-14cfea22d4dc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"55ee8eec-d7d7-4cd9-98e9-4fc4c49efad7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"05b178c6-d58c-4f7d-a38a-b57bf016b1e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge","Overview":"Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge is a darts game endorsed by the 1989 world champion.

When he wakes up he realizes he has lost his sword. He asks a farmer about the sword and is directed to a land full of ababol flowers. He is confused, but believes the red flowers may be tied to recovering his sword and decides to collect them, hoping to then continue his journey to Jerusalem.\n\nThe game consists of a single, large level that comprises many single-screen rooms. The player can explore freely as the rooms are linked horizontally and vertically. To win the game 25 red flowers have to be collected in any order and then the game is won right away. Sir Ababol can move around and jump. He has no means to attack enemies and creatures and has to avoid them. Water is also a hazard. Sometimes keys need to be picked up to open doors to continue to a next section. Sir Ababol has a large amount of health with a single life. He can sustain more than one hundred hits, but life is drained quickly when in water or in an enemy's path. Health also counts down over time, acting as a time limit to complete the game. Some screens contain chicken to restore some health.\n\nThe NES and Amiga versions keep the original level lay-out, but with a few changes to the gameplay. The entire level is turned into a side-scrolling environment.

The package included a booklet and two programs.\n\nThe first program allowed you to see facts about the World Cup or participate with yourself or a friend in a quiz. The Facts section allowed you to see every result from every World Cup or how every team did as well. The Quiz section gave you 3 minutes to answer as many questions as you could from a choice of 5 answers. The quicker you answered a question the more points you received and if you played with a friend you took in it turns to answer a question. There was a high score table for the best scores.\n\nThe second program was a management game. Here you could choose any team that has played in the World Cup and attempt to get them to the final and win it. You are given a squad of players or you can select your own. Choose your best team and it's onto the actual match. The 1st half lets you watch the match highlights in text form with any major incidents appearing on the screen. Occasionally a penalty is awarded and you can choose which direction to kick it or which direction your keeper should dive. An isometric view of the penalty is shown to see if it was missed or scored. In the 2nd half you play two arcade sections to improve your score within a time limit. The two games are heading or shooting. The heading section is an isometric view and the ball comes in from the side. You have to position your player to head the ball at the goal. The shooting section is shown from above and shows a football boot. A ball bounces around the screen and you must move the boot to hit the ball into a moving net at the top of the screen. You must make sure the ball doesn't go past your boot into the net behind you. The computer decides how well you played and adds goals to your score or the oppositions."},"180225":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"8a0a638d-63b4-4db1-a442-f286e31749d9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"World-Wise"},"180226":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"4c0fadb7-0ae9-4785-9e37-2a8d2a699861.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"d9399ffa-d1cf-4523-9266-63b026702741.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6627208f-8628-4809-9fa6-41f56300fab5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"228a2177-5351-4cb1-b506-55a89913e648.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8574fb6d-0471-4243-baef-e391564fb078.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"18cee27b-2de4-4466-af50-a04762d505d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"World Cup","Overview":"World Cup is a football game where you and seven friends can pick one of 10 teams and compete to get to the final and win it.

The game is divided into two chapters (El bosque de Aqueron and La morada de Arihman) with an intro and an outro. The character is guided through a game world of single-screen rooms that are connected horizontally and vertically offering a large amount of free exploration. The warrior starts with three lives and there is a health bar as he can take multiple hits. He navigates platforms, can jump and attacks enemies with an axe. Objects in the environment can be destroyed and there are many hazards and traps such as spikes suddenly appearing. Enemies often keep respawning endlessly without a means to stop them permanently. Some items can be picked up to restore health.\n\nA chapter ends with a boss but in the first chapter to face it a large number of vases need to be destroyed. This builds up the image of a vase in the bottom left side of the screen and once all vases have been destroyed and the image is complete, a talisman appears in the inventory and the boss can be faced to end the stage.

As nobody is qualified to take the enemy on, your task is to complete the 30 levels of training (the actual war could've been the basis for a sequel, although this never happened). The levels alternate between controlling a Star Fighter plane and a Ground Assault Vehicle; the latter is faster but is confined to ground motion. The plane can move up and down to make dodging the simulated enemy fire easier. This generally comes at you in waves, although there are also ground installations. Central to the game is to shoot at the cases of plasma crystals, and then fly over these so as to carry them to the end of the level. Dying loses you one of these crystals if you have at least one, or a life if you do not. Completing a level with at least 2 crystals is effectively a restart point as well, as when you die you are sent back to a level in which you collected at least 2.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"180383":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"7b14a9e0-2add-422d-9022-f902150fa511.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Circuito De Lemans"},"180392":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"1cf3f5bc-15d8-4ab6-8e94-01ba61b24b51.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Score 3020","Overview":"This game consists in disputing an exciting pinball game against a computer.

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports. Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right. The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"180532":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Topo Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"cc6f0c28-0bc0-44af-99a8-6c0fdc7031bc.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a354a072-56bc-402e-87c9-00fe5cb477b2.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f2e5996b-bbdc-4863-9b4f-c52c40059f3f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fe8f0909-8365-409e-ace5-6b81679c8017.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"836a577a-8d5b-4e61-974a-9a90bdcc1637.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"026a3f9d-99b9-4bd9-9301-a04609817ca2.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3b315c06-6ab5-406f-94c0-a8016a730537.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4bf6fe5d-f9c1-4f6d-ada6-3fae99e6480b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Viaje al Centro de la Tierra","Overview":"In this Jules Verne inspired game you are gonna take a journey to the center of the earth.

After the completion of its task, the ship submerged to an oceanic abyss. The D.A.G. (\"giant-looking depredators\"), a war-mongering civilization, took possession of Atlantis with the intention of conquering Somerset and the universe. Somerset sends a hero to rescue Atlantis from the enemy, and return it home.\n\nRescue from Atlantis is a Spanish side-scrolling action-adventure game divided in three loads. In the first load, the hero must find a way to gain entrance to the camouflage city built on top of Atlantis. This level starts with the bathysphere being dropped from the sky into the ocean by a spaceship. Once it hits the bottom, the player can guide it. The bathysphere is armed with a laser gun. The protagonist can also be ejected from the bathysphere in order to explore more strait entrances. There are objects scattered on the sea floor to be collected and used. The bathysphere also comes with some useful paraphernalia: a jetpack to reach higher places; a portable computer to connect with the main one in Atlantis; a first-aid kit that can only be used once; and a mould to fabricate gold bars.There are some gold nuggets on the submersed caves (to melt them the player has to find a source of heat).\n\nThe player investigates a complex of aquatic tunnels while collecting the needed tools for the task ahead. At the top of the screen there are two horizontal bars. The leftmost indicates the oxygen level (there are places on the levels that replenish it). The one in the right side is the bathysphere fuel level; once empty, the vessel will stop moving. The player must find sources of fuel to make it swim again. In this first load, the main danger comes from the creatures of the sea: octopuses, sharks and abyssal fishes take a bit of the energy when the character touches them.\n\nIn the second load the bathysphere enters the city that was raised on Atlantis, now under the sea and in ruins. Guarding the entrance to the ship is Korx, a powerful D.A.G. mage. The main objective of this level is to find a way to destroy him (he is invulnerable to the laser weapons). Besides the animals of the previous load, the character has to fight hammerheads and some alien creatures.\n\nThe final load sees the bathysphere entering Atlantis. The ship is a mechanical labyrinth, with lifts and sentinel robots. The main objective is to find the computer room, where the hero can activate the ship and bring it back to Somerset.\n\nThe game has a password system: after solving each load, an alphanumeric code is displayed on the screen. The code is generated based on the actions accomplished. The second and third load require this code to start. It is possible to reach an unwinnable situation by failing to collect or assemble the necessary objects for the completion of a later level.","Publisher":"Dinamic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"180568":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Strip Poker 2 +"},{"Name":"Strip Poker 2 Plus"}],"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"d973c3e7-f828-45b8-b267-f75d812c7cc7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b78dd344-bb6c-4611-b6e8-f6409e596d17.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d85c3cad-1901-495e-b873-c5ac0ad7da6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1f898781-23f1-4af6-85fd-faa0cffd25fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Strip Poker II Plus","Overview":"A sizzling and exciting game of poker awaits you as you pit your skills against Donna and Sam in a game of Poker.

Five of his friends have been locked by the Tetrarca Pachin Poi Poi on the planet Cityland and he has to rescue them. These friends are all characters by other games from The Mojon Twins or the developers: Chost-Embustes from the Chost-Embustes series, Horace from Horace Goes to the Tower, Nanako from the Nanako series, Phantomasa from the Phantomasa series, and Sgt. Helmet from the Sgt. Helmet series. They were all hired for a job, but messed up. To complete the game Mariano needs to finish their tasks and correct their mistakes.\n\nThe game consists of a single, large level formed by a large amount of single-screen rooms connected both horizontally and vertically using the flip-screen mechanic offering a large amount of freedom. Mariano starts with 80 health and has no means of attack, so he has to avoid hazards and enemies. The main actions are moving around and jumping. There are many platforming sections to complete. Each friend is locked up in a different cell and five keys of different colours need to be found to open them. This can be done in any order.\n\nThe corresponding key is only provided after that character's task has been completed. Completing a task often requires locating and picking up a specific item first. For Nanako you need to find her green boots and use them to defeat ten Karakasa enemies. For Sgt. Helmet a disk needs to be found to send plans of an enemy fortress using a computer terminal. Horace had to paint fifteen cans red and Mariano can do this once he has found a bucket of red paint. The Chost-Embustes were hired to rid a cave of ghosts. Mariano needs to collect five traps as well as the dematerializer and then head to the caves to trap five ghosts.

It's up to a band of heroes to restore order and defeat the forces of darkness.\n\nFer & Flamme is a party-based RPG, with rules heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (character classes and levels, races, monsters). The player creates a party of five characters, distributing points between 4 traits (strength, intelligence, dexterity, wisdom) and choosing spells and equipment and sets out to explore Thulynte.\n\nThe game uses a system of icons for player input. The display switches between an overland map for travel, a first-person view when exploring cities, and a top-down tactical view for combat.\n\nFer & Flamme was huge for an Amstrad game, with a 40000 squares map and cities with more than 120 different locations, using all the space available on both sides of two floppies. A PC port was started by UBI Soft but abandoned when the main developer quit.","Publisher":"Ubi Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vvo2MdtMRFs"},"181813":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Golden Eagle El Retorno","Region":"Spain"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0f3d5a5c-0d7c-4a31-aa53-f6de0424e786.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"f9807145-8db6-44af-b66a-c357ffda8e42.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e0e24206-8617-4ca5-87db-1381a2073d5d.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c623ee02-bf77-439a-9e42-153ab3b6d405.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ba2adfe3-eb83-4233-a8f8-d80d3ffd2ba2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1cbb2953-080f-400f-9896-c1c9eef5cd70.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"L'Aigle d'Or: Le Retour","Publisher":"Loriciel","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"181814":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"The Train: Escape to Normandy"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Accolade","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"cdcccad5-d6dc-44a8-9dae-23000cb33670.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"91f961eb-e7ba-49fd-98a6-d0e70f60cd25.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"a22bd163-b95f-4277-be1b-59871f53c6cc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"96667d65-9c78-430b-9c74-e09937f415a5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9a3d3956-328d-42d1-a8f2-297febcd3f79.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Train","Overview":"In the months before France is liberated by the Allies in World War 2, Germany tries to take Paris' collection of classic paintings.

It was during the horror of a deep night, I walked in the Norwegian countryside thinking back to the adventures I had already experienced since the start of the game. It all started in the good town of Drontheim, which my privileged position (I am the son of Viceroy Ordener Guldenlew) had until then allowed me to apprehend in what it had more mundane. So I lived in peace, pretending to marry in just marriage with the daughter of the Chevalier d'Ahlefeld. Only my visits to the port, from where you could see looming in the distance, the sinister fortress of Munc-kolm, gave me a glimpse that a life full of adventures awaited me outside our proud city, shudderingly coiled up in its ramparts.\n\nThe ancient geole\n\nEverything changed the day I entered the geoles of Munckolm to visit a prisoner. The latter begged me to help him by finding a certain Dispolsen, who, he said, held in his possession capital documents since proving his innocence. I accepted sansdêiai and went in search of the savior ...\n\nOh Thanos scent (my beautiful tree)\n\nAfter having visited different places, very well put on the screen and supported by a scrolling with each lateral movement, I finally ended up in the morgue where I found Dispolsen as stiff and pale as a herring in brine! The famous documents had disappeared, probably stolen by his attacker, a rogue flèfé responding to the nickname of Han from Iceland. It was for me the opportunity to meet the keeper of the morgue, Spiagudry, a poor fellow that some hard cash soon convinced to lead me to the cave where Han was hiding.\n\nEpilogue\n\nI could go on like this and describe to you the wonderful Scandinavian landscapes that you cross on your way to Vygla by the Skongen road (you turn after Drontheim and it is straight ahead crossing the Ordals by the Hau-broen bridge: You can not be wrong). I could also boast about the sweet chills you get from hearing such an evil, digital laugh, just before running out of the giant's tower. I could also tell you that the movements are done by means of the arrows on the keyboard and that some common words can be found using the function keys, the rest of the dialogue being done in everyday language.","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=t52IUteuIUQ"},"182286":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Harry & Harry: La Boite de Rajmahal"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ERE Informatique","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3d08fbe2-606e-41ed-84a9-c55d5a746294.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b0c45347-d9f6-4079-ad0b-24ece29916f0.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9669eefb-faae-4e00-a321-3390dbe9a99a.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d85c87da-a1f2-4db7-8b99-0827d459a177.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0d355980-37cc-434b-8235-4e2026f11444.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Harry & Harry: La Boîte de Rajmahal","Overview":"February 11, 1934, 8 o'clock in the morning ... when you leave your apartment at the Hiklass Building in Los Angeles, you are surprised by the all-spring atmosphere that reigns this morning; you go to the newsstand where you will do your one and only daily task: buying your newspaper.

Bertrand Brocard and his team at Cobra Soft \/ Hitech Productions created a game following that story - which turns to be a rather unique 'simulator of a corrupted policeman'.\n\nThe game mechanics is somewhat similar to the one in the 'Meurtres' series by the same authors: we walk the street of Paris meeting people and talking to them, but the gameplay is much more complex. It is worth mentioning that the game uses more than 25 keyboard keys for controls: we can arrest suspects, search them, check our position on the map, take a car ride, or a police car ride, or a subway ride etc. The main goal is to collect enough kickbacks to be able to realize the dream of the policeman in the movie - to retire and buy a PMU-bar near the horse racing place (and that's a lot of money, 2 millions of 'new' francs). Besides, we still have to do our police job as well, visiting the Police Commissioner each morning and following his orders, arresting the criminals etc.","Publisher":"Cobra Soft","ReleaseDate":"1987-09-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"182311":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Templiers d'Orven, Les"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciels","Genres":"Adventure; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"8c7d25c6-eb70-444b-92ed-51cb722ada31.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"97ee8262-5833-4c3a-82fe-a282567c2d52.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8900dccb-b0a6-4703-9e51-223fd1e4e993.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d15fc488-98ee-4a4c-b118-994427278385.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Les Templiers d'Orven","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"182312":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Orphee: Le voyage aux enfers"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciels","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5f167c0e-7448-418c-8949-b656bcd7e9d2.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"921d3313-22c3-4a1e-a05b-28f172a0c46e.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"538fefe5-0723-4a5d-b8fe-ea360dc32ccf.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"64d0c5aa-de9f-427b-a38c-a9dd26036ada.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"731fa09d-6c4e-46c6-bb17-965f5cda4d28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Orphée: Le voyage aux enfers","Overview":"It was a hot day.

Only few planets and hundreds of men stay rebels to the oppression of the empire. You, Martín Luke Skywalker, are one of them.\n\nYou live in the Tutuflex planet, a desertic place located thousands of years light from our Solar System. Centuries ago, their inhabitants lived calmly and peacefully without more preoccupations than annually collecting the fruits of the plantations of giant turnips, the only source of wealth of the planet. Tutuflex saw with certain unconcern how the forces of the Empire, long ago a reduced group of mercenaries of the worst kind, became one of the most powerful armies of the universe subduing an always rising number of planets, everything seemed so distant…\n\nUntil a sad day, the forces of the empire arrived, and before the pacific inhabitants of Tutuflex had time to ask themselves what it was happening, they erased by laser all sign of life and peace of the surface of the planet.\n\nNow you are a man without land, without family, without future… in your heart there's only place for resentment and revenge.\n\nHaving explained this, it would look (and indeed looks) as one of the most dramatic ways to start an adventure, if it wasn't because it's actually a parody of Star Wars (\"La Guerra de las Galaxias\", not \"Vajillas\", in Spanish). Besides title, you will also notice that all names of characters, places, etc have been modified in order to make the Spanish user more familiar -in a non-serious way- with them. Add to it that even the most tense situations will have a joke surrounding them, and as a result you have the first integral humorous adventure ever made in Spain.","Publisher":"Dinamic Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"182480":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e9c17899-f533-4080-b77e-132a86bf3662.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b323ea1f-d67c-4889-858d-a24623a2ae8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"High Noon","Overview":"High Noon is a Western Shoot-em-up game based on the arcade game Boot Hill.\n\nThe goal is as in a cowboy duel, to shoot your opponent first.

A Roman inspired group led by the Ephore Crassus has conquered the city of New-Cythere from a Spartan inspired group. Four adventurers have then turned up at the citadel, and started asking questions about a mysterious chamber beneath the city. You control these adventurers, and your aim is to find information about what is going on, and leave the city.\n\nThis French language game is a typical turn based first person 3D dungeon crawler. You have a single pool of character points to assign to the abilities of all four party members (Alton, Elisabeth, Jofil and Eddy). Abilities affect physical based attack (e.g. Constitution and Agility) and supposedly also mental characteristics (e.g. Intelligence, Aura, Observation, etc). Once the characters are prepared, you start in the ground floor of the citadel.\n\nInteraction is through an icon based menu system, with options allowing movement, sorting of character inventory, seeing your character stats and seeing your orientation. Once movement mode is selected, the party moves by using the arrow keys. Most encounters occur at predetermined positions. Some will be non-hostile characters, where an interaction menu is opened which allows talk, trade and combat. There are also many hostile praetorian guards. When these are met, a combat menu will open up.\n\nCombat occurs by selecting each party member in turn, and choosing an action. These include parry, lunge, strike, persuasion and running. If there are multiple opponents, you can select which one to strike. After this, pressing the forwards arrow executes the commands. Damage in each round is dependent on character stats and weapon\/armor stats. The process continues until one side is defeated. If your opponents are defeated, they usually leave items (but they disappear once you enter movement mode again).\n\nEach character may carry (and automatically be equipped with) one weapon, one shield, one helm and one suit of armour. Keys may also be found, which open locked doors. In addition to this is a bag of four items for the party rather than the individuals. There are at least five levels of the citadel. There does not appear to be any mechanism for character improvement (such as experience and levelling). There also seems to be no important dialogue during the game. The explanation for what is happening is supposedly revealed once the party has completed their investigation and returned to their starting point.","Publisher":"Chip","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"183890":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Traitement Bzzz"}],"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6104e589-fc4c-4fdf-8530-d6556b8d7717.png","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"2dfd30d3-8b17-4a75-9eb5-d2cd22ef21d4.png","Region":"France","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3bbba039-cfcc-453a-8ceb-d103b4d71324.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"668d74cd-4f18-4b9c-aeb8-7ea94976fb46.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a331bf4a-acac-48ba-bbfe-e5c864004b60.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5bed0b15-9d52-481d-a1ed-1a5faea3bf59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fa84724e-fe0b-42cb-af31-afecc629eb58.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6b70c092-6dce-4f63-b5ff-f3407e55e3ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Les Aventures du Ka: Traitement Bzzz","Overview":"How to eliminate the too brilliant special agent Karl ADRIX, nicknamed the \"KA\"?

It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart.

Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you soon in the Galia and Hispania.

Luxor the Moonprince's son Morkin has been kidnapped by Shareth, daughter of Doomdark, the evil ruler deposed in the first game. The player initially takes control of Luxor, Rothron the Wise, and Morkin's lover Tarithel the Fey, although many more characters can be recruited as the game progresses, as they aim to banish Shareth and rescue Morkin. Shareth has brainwashed him, so he must also be turned back to Luxor's side.\n\nThe game is effectively turn-based; your characters move by day (with a limited amount of movement possible, with each move in one of the 8 compass directions) and Shareth's by night. You will find plains, mountains, forests, underground tunnels and mysterious temples on your journey. A dark mist follows much of the area, which causes your characters to deteriorate in mood and thus become less effective.\n\nThe characters are now split into five distinct tribes - Giant, Dwarf, Fey, Icemark and Barbarians, and recruiting new characters into your party isn't automatic - factors such as the game situation can make some refuse to join, turn on members of other races, or defect (as the Utarg did in the first game).\n\nThere are several different objectives and possible outcomes to the game. Bringing Morkin back to the Gates of Varenorn is the most basic one, but many other characters ought to be saved, Shareth can be killed completely (with practice!), and there are many Crowns of Icemark to be retrieved. As in the first game, control of the full party only remains while Luxor is alive - his death means total defeat.","Publisher":"Beyond Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"192627":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e2ee00ee-4adf-415d-b876-9f491ce259c3.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9a3a971b-6396-48be-a781-f2f656bc3d2c.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"17a76fe8-b12c-41bd-9f27-2d9422bd35b2.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c710cb72-466e-4e1e-bd09-955fed4010d4.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0b69d6af-d732-469d-adcc-c7d6c0fb8ca6.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e18b361f-a541-41ca-b692-e37909b74f1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"040bfd03-fbae-4184-afcd-31192c18d177.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b1f44b4d-8a17-432f-bb4d-f9aa0e4b9604.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dossier \"G\": L'affaire du Rainbow-warrior","Overview":"Unclassifiable ..

Shar Breiz Island was not far away. It was about time because the storm was then threatening. I should have been wary when the fishermen told me that it was possible to go to the island with this boat. The smirk they got when I told them about Shar Breiz should have made me be more careful. But I had to go see Maxime Minotier at all costs, to talk to him about my business. Maxime is a rich industrialist and, moreover, he is my friend. I was hopeful that I would make the deal with him. I could already make out the shapes of a large building, I docked on the island as packets of sea passed over the pier. The least we can say is that I arrived just before the storm. Once all the presentations have been made,seeing that I still did not manage to warm myself, Leon, the servant offered to sit down near the fireplace. As the noon hour approached, I was invited to the dining room for lunch.  \n It was then that some incredible and mysterious events occurred which forced me to go back several years in order to find some explanations.\nAmédée Minotier, father of my friend Maxime, went mad after being wounded in the war. That's what everyone thought. In fact, it was his research on parallel worlds that really messed his mind up.\n\nThe works he was able to read and occasionally translate are still in the house. His second son, Aristide, shared the same passion for the occult sciences when he passed away in the spring of 1908.\n\nDuring the meal, when all the inhabitants of the island were gathered, that is to say only six people, a great crash was heard in the entrance, the door opened and a man of high stature but completely emaciated, made burst into the great hall. Everyone was terrified, except old Amédée who was expressing immense joy as he clapped his hands. Immediately, I questioned the old man: \"Do you know this\" man \"? Who is he?\" Unfortunately, his madness made worse by this new emotional shock.\nmade his answers inconsistent. It was Maxime who first gave me the explanation I was looking for. This man who seemed to return from hell was her brother, Aristide. Disappeared for twenty years, the latter seemed to have definitely lost all his reason. We dressed him in his nightgown and then took him to his room, which hadn't been changed for years. Aristide, pale, fell asleep, leaving everyone in the deepest anxiety. \n \nI  had completely forgotten the affairs that had brought me to the island and I was only interested in this mysterious story.\nI asked the inhabitants a few questions, but my main question remained unanswered. Where could this seventh inhabitant of the island come from? The storm was raging, it was unlikely that it could have arrived from the mainland. To progress in my research, I decided to go inspect the library. I picked, at random, the books that could be interesting. Many were still in their original language. Hearing only good French, I was unable to study the most technically fascinating books. The occult sciences will therefore remain a mystery to me for a long time to come. As for the novels, the library seemed very well stocked, as all the bestsellers were present. Behind large volumes,I even discovered a little book telling some legends about Brittany. In this booklet, embellished with small sketches, I unearthed a chapter relating the history of Shar Breiz Island.\n\nAlready, in the most remote times of the history of Brittany, the inhabitants of the island stood out from their contemporaries. Where the other Celts lined up menhirs and dolmens, the first islanders had erected curious monuments. It would even seem that, much more recently, around 1830, during a battle between wreckers and sailors, the captain of the bandis, who had been captured, then mysteriously vanished, taking with him his booty and his secret.\nWhat if there was some connection between these two disappearances? How could people disappear from this island and where?\n\nAs I was telling myself that a secret passage might just be the explanation for all of this, I clearly heard a scream coming from outside the house. I rushed out and discovered the horrible spectacle. Leon, the servants' son had been horribly mutilated. Only a monstrous beast could have done this job, the bite and scratch marks were very sharp and very wide. This heinous murder was unfortunately only the first in a long list. I took an oath to find out which animal was thus murdering the inhabitants of the island and to prevent it from harming, even if this task were to cost me my life, or if I should sink into madness. Very well done. Incantation has a very studied scenario. With the greatest respect for the Myth of Cthulu,everything has been designed to worry and terrorize ... Technically, the game is perfect, the actions are easy to use, the graphics are precise and we note with joy that each character has his own language and his own facial expressions.

This means that a lot of advance route-planning is required, although most creatures can be killed by landing on their heads (horizontal contact with them is however fatal). The tarantulas are perhaps the deadliest foe, as they move so quickly.

Droid 1 is the only droid that can dig through the earth, Droid 2 can beam survivors to safety (by moving over them) and Droid 3 can push rocks (only one at a time). The goal in each of the seven levels is to rescue all survivors within the time limit, while paying attention not to trap or damage any of the droids.

It is here that we join him at the start of an adventure that may well change his whole life.\n\nMapping is not quite so devious as in Werewolf Simulator, but you must still take care to explore the terrain with pencil and paper at hand. Exploring the surrounding roads and woods, you realise that there is more to Avenbury than first meets the eye. The number of locations is not very large, but it is what you do in these locations that is going to be vitally important.\nAs with other games from the same author, useful items are not obvious, you must actively look for them. The first location is a good example: There are many useful things just lying around or within view, but you must SEARCH, EXAMINE, LOOK IN and LOOK UNDER everything you can think of to find what is there.\n\nThe program is written using Incentive's Graphic Adventure Creator and has the usual limitations of graphic design and parser. With that in mind, the graphics are an improvement over earlier adventures and the parser will accept sufficiently complex commands to make life a little interesting.\nThe amount of descriptive text is limited but still sets the scene adequately. The atmosphere is more in the mind than on the screen and builds quite nicely to the climax, which has a nice twist.\n\nThere can be no comparison between the elegant operation of something like Jinxter or Knight Ore and Druids Moon, but then there is a great difference in price.
