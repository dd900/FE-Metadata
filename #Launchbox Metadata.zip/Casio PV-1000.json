The main screen resembles a typical pachinko unit with pins for balls to bounce on, spinners for balls to put in motion, and baskets for them to land in. The baskets open and close, and so does the big feature in the middle of the screen, an airplane or spaceship with an integrated fruit-machine like counter. When a score specified by the counters is reached, the game changes to a shooter sequence, where the pachinko balls must be used to shoot down aliens. After that, the game continues to the next table.\n\nThe control mechanism is similar to golf games, in that the longer you press the button, the more power is given to the ball ejection mechanism. This makes for an experience unlike a real pachinko machine, where the perfect power of the ejector is reached by setting a dial at the right angle, after which it can be locked at that angle. In Pachinko UFO, you must hit a perfect timing instead.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Casio PV-1000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Casio Computer Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Casio Computer Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"d90a14d1-447b-4c93-9174-8939cf7f51f7.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"35e17d05-6283-4301-a6bd-3571557e4bd0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"44db070b-76c1-406d-afb0-1e5cfb65f07b.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"d4f365e6-a8f5-4c1f-a536-8707a970cce2.PNG","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"c79c0c74-edcf-4ba2-bc66-835cd5682d75.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"04408716-fe48-49a2-8938-653351623d28.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":127605,"FileName":"b131fd7b-630d-4d3b-a7c5-f3decc6b71e7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":127604,"Name":"Pooyan","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"In Pooyan, you play the role of a pig, protecting its piglets from wolves.\n\nThe first screen takes place near the pigs' home. Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig. But if she shoots their balloons, they splat on the ground instead.\n\nThe wolves shoot acorns at the pig. But Mrs. Pig has a food based weapon too. If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit. Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ihr3WiN32s","Platform":"Casio PV-1000","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Konami Industry Co.
