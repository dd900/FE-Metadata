Virgin ported the game to home computer systems DOS, the Atari ST and the Archimedes, and the consoles Jaguar, Mega Drive, SNES and 3DO. The game is military-themed and based on shooting action but with a strategy game-style control system. The player directs troops through numerous missions, battling enemy infantry, vehicles and installations.\n\nCannon Fodder has a darkly humorous tone which commentators variously praised and condemned. Its creators intended it to convey an anti-war message, which some reviewers recognised, but the Daily Star and a number of public figures derided the game. In other respects, reviewers highly praised the game, which widely achieved scores of over 90% in Amiga magazines. Amiga Action awarded it an unprecedented score, calling it the best game of the year.","Publisher":"Virgin Games","ReleaseYear":1994},"33317":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Cosmic Relief: Prof. Renegade to the Rescue"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Argus Press","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"9e4f91b2-ea3a-4066-8e18-70c902ed4893.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"50b52f29-5eb2-46af-8954-44fbbb8aeab1.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"760bb10a-9f1e-404f-940a-f8d568afdab3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Terramex","Overview":"This multi-level action\/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth. You're in charge of finding Professor Renegade. \n\nSelect one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger!\n\nUse the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected. \n\nTo look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck.

Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.\n\nEach of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).\n\nInterestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction.\n\nGaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Tutankham, Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.","Publisher":"Microdeal","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KjTYvMSxnQc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Time_Bandit"},"33541":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eclipse Software Design","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0ada172b-3fe0-4d0a-bdf1-eeb9e1c0e053.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"226a652f-f200-40ce-8cf3-be3f0c9fe494.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"113c5c83-59bb-4717-8af0-c7b0e22867ea.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a3202f2-05a4-407a-917d-717a2539c8f5.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"172aa745-ca6a-4df5-afb3-30ba2406663b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a1b510ee-46f6-425e-81c7-ced16cc9bb35.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Lethal Xcess","Overview":"The great magician Sagyr has succeeded in defeating his nemesis, the wicked witch Xandrilia, and regained the human shape of his former self.

The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy.\n\nThe U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by \"The Boss\", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.\n\nOn May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped \"The Boss\" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.\n\nYour mission is to liberate \"The Boss\" and to bring him back safely.\n\nYou're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where \"The Boss\" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.\n\nYou'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.\n\nIn each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. Once you reach the point where \"The Boss\" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place.\n\nOn the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect \"The Boss\" whose physical condition has been worn out.\n\nWild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you.","Publisher":"Titus France SA","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rEIPIrJlZqk"},"97264":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ERE Informatique","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"896ac7be-c08d-42d3-b4f6-2c42fe75659f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"72464394-0a69-46e2-9021-d9679975bbba.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fef313a6-8395-46d9-9574-42d0316105fe.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eef78641-583d-4e90-a3dc-f61e52bead2d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Warlock","Overview":"Warlock is a game which played much like Ghosts & Goblins.

The easiest difficulty level starts the player(s) in the first level with no bonuses. The player controls a tank with constantly draining fuel, and must navigate through multiple levels (14 stations in the arcade version) from bottom to top, encountering obstacles and enemies. Along the way, a player may find powerups including tank fuel, stars (currency), shields, and two types of sub-weapons: smart shots (homing missiles) and bombs (powerful rockets). Each level has a key that will open a door at the top of the level, which will either take the player to the next level or to a special hub with multiple powerups that must be escaped in 10 seconds or less. (15 for the NES version, though the timer stays stuck at 10 for five seconds before counting) If the player is unable to escape, the tank will lose half its fuel. After escaping the hub, the player(s) then proceeds to the next station.\n\nOccasionally, the player(s) will face a boss that must be defeated to advance. Normal shots are ineffective however, and the player must decide\/guess the appropriate time to buy sub-weapons to greatly raise the chance of victory. After destroying a boss, the player(s) can continue to the end of the level.\n\nBetween levels, the player is taken to a shop where items and upgrades to tank speed, power, etc. may be purchased with stars. Any damage caused to the player's tank will decrease the shield level. Purchasing a shield drastically reduces damage down to a mere pixel worth of the fuel gauge per hit. When the fuel depletes, the speed of the tank is reduced to a crawl and a countdown begins from 10. If no fuel is gained before the timer reaches zero, or if the player is shot during the countdown, the tank explodes and a life is lost.\n\nThe arcade version, in addition to having special two-joystick controls for each player, contained three special contest levels, with one contest star in each. With three contest stars and nine normal stars, the player(s) could compete in a special time-limited contest level in which the player could win a T-shirt. A later version of the game was released which eliminated the contest levels and stars.\n\n(Above Right): The Box Art for Tengen's Vindicator, created by Game Illustrator Marc Ericksen, focusses on futuristic armored vehicles in action.","Publisher":"Tengen","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cgk5si2oTD4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vindicators"},"97364":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Binary Design","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f3db9dfb-f1ab-4567-af70-1c1a34bbf045.jpg","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b100f969-d53e-46ce-8bac-c395e88e1c22.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"df31f0eb-0956-467d-9041-912b47ccb072.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"40ef6f43-4358-4638-8e6f-97b5876a449f.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5aafe73a-0e98-4e4c-b28d-f3cba75bda4e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Vectorball","Overview":"This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?).

The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more.\n\nMost of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark. \n\nThe game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point & click and has no function to save progress.","Publisher":"Coktel Vision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"111109":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Asterix im Morgenland"},{"AlternateName":"Astérix chez Rahazade","Region":"France"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cedic Nathan","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"daa31236-787b-4b53-81f9-1aefcc224ef6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"83f61a0f-054d-45d7-94b1-39d4f9ad22cf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"575c13ba-7ac7-4287-9813-cfde25d038f9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b6ea6f2-f120-4b6a-ad60-e756e46e4d39.jpg","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Astérix and the Magic Carpet","Overview":"Asterix and the Magic Carpet is the twenty-eighth volume of the Asterix comic book series, by René Goscinny (stories) and Albert Uderzo (illustrations). It was first published in 1987. It is the fourth book to be published after the death of René Goscinny and is thus both written and drawn by Albert Uderzo alone.\n\nThe full original French title was Astérix chez Rahàzade ou Le compte des mille et une heures (Asterix meets Orinjade or the 1001 Hours Countdown), a reference to Queen Scheherazade who tells the famous 1001 Arabian Nights collection of stories.\n\nFollowing the successful rebuilding of the village after Brutus' attack in the previous story, Chief Vitalstatistix is trying to give a speech, when he is interrupted by the bard Cacofonix, whose song causes rain. This introduces Watziznehm the fakir, by dropping him from his flying carpet; whereupon Watziznehm explains that he is searching for a way to make it rain in his country, a kingdom in the Ganges Valley, in fear that if no rain falls in the following 1001 hours, Princess Orinjade, daughter of Rajah Wotzit, will be executed as a sacrifice to the gods. This prophecy is part of an evil scheme by Grand Vizier Hoodunnit, to seize the throne.\n\nVitalstatistix agrees to send the rain-making Cacofonix to India, accompanied by Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix. All five mount the flying carpet; but their journey is often interrupted either by Obelix's insistence on obtaining food, by Cacofonix's attempts to sing, and once by a lightning strike which forces them to replace the carpet. The Gauls eventually arrive in India with exactly 30 hours, 30 minutes, and 30 seconds to save Orinjade; but Cacofonix has lost his voice during the journey, and Rajah Wotzit's doctors proclaim that to regain his voice, Cacofonix must take an overnight bath in a combination of elephant milk, dung and hair. Accordingly, the Gauls and Watziznehm take Cacofonix to elephant-trainer 'Howdoo' and set up the bath; but Hoodunnit sends his henchmen to kidnap the bard, and take him to an elephants' graveyard to be trampled by the wild elephant herd.\n\nWhen Watziznehm, Asterix, and Obelix set out to recover the bard, they are stopped by Owzat, Hoodunnit's fakir sidekick. While Watziznehm and Owzat curse each other, Asterix and Obelix escape to Howdoo, with whom they embark to the elephants' graveyard. After delays by tigers, monkeys, a rhinoceros, and Hoodunnit's henchmen, they find Cacofonix alive and well, his smell having placated the elephants. Meanwhile Watziznehm defeats Owzat and recovers the Gauls on his flying carpet.\n\nAt the execution grounds, Asterix defeats Orinjade's executioner and saves her, while Watziznehm intercepts Hoodunnit. Cacofonix recovers his voice by the dose of magic potion he has taken, and sings, causing rain. At the victory feast in the palace, Obelix surmises that his fellow villagers might be having their customary banquet, this time without him. This is proven true; and at the banquet, some of the Gauls begin to express desire to retrieve the bard, in fear of a drought, and Fulliautomatix the blacksmith, Cacofonix's habitual menace, appears to be missing him.","Publisher":"Coktel Vision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Asterix_and_the_Magic_Carpet_(Coktel_Vision_video_game)"},"111117":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"a4fe9d7e-7dfb-4b68-9cdd-6ad801993c0b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f24a1660-1529-48c1-9d43-414c30c923b9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dcba6f69-f285-4458-8d6c-99242db45467.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0923073d-a54e-4814-b499-c052d1a169a9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"85bca3d4-5c8d-430f-a220-316dcaa66d95.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c269f6f3-0526-4f01-9919-545236a9c291.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Super Breakout","Overview":"Super Breakout features similar gameplay to the original, but with several new game variations.

In 'Progressive' the brick walls will slowly drop towards the bottom of the screen and the ball moves progressively faster and faster.

The player initially controls a character referred to as \"Commander Jameson\", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.\n\nElite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).","Publisher":"Firebird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"111176":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Advent Software","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"d057870e-d001-474b-a535-c7d5438f29eb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"England Team Manager","Overview":"England Team Manager is a management game for one player where you lead the English national football team.\n\nIn the competition your team will face nine other teams and the nation that is top of the league at the end of the game will be declared champions.

Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.\n\nViewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.\n\nThe game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.\n\nThis earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.","Publisher":"Hewson Consultants Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/rnKUzDpf9dU","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ranarama"},"121867":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"6aa3461b-919f-439d-be0e-7c7936bcbf3e.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c4016a15-346e-446b-b9e3-6be2ef21cf0e.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"469e27c2-eb8f-4bf9-8056-b75cb6899314.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"875c4c27-7b48-4368-a811-84c9cee5bbf6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e303e751-7081-45d3-9430-7cf779c17b9c.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6a91afd6-2862-4ca0-80a1-3637b658f68e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0ef34af9-bef7-4c57-a154-05b5de66252d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Rock 'n' Roll Clams","Overview":"Help Caspar Clam and Band shake, rattle and roll their way from the Bottom of the Ocean to the Top of the Charts!\n\nGet out of your shell and hang on to your pearls as you sen the Record Business into a spin!\n\nGet ready for twice the fun and twice the action as you and another player race against each other to be the first to form your band.\n\nNot only will you have the regular game obstacles to contend with but you can also make thing difficult for your rival, so watch out!","Publisher":"Caspian Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KH-P02LEIZI"},"121878":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tecmo","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"95c3df3a-d9ed-4ee6-858c-cb3baa88e973.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"69e64c99-bfd4-46e8-a446-9408d06b27f6.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"de86f879-fa61-4da1-8da8-93dc5beeb2d9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"30393a37-b550-45f1-a81b-e3aee795e2c6.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5aa070e7-9035-4357-b5fd-300cfd6a3537.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b09cd91a-8821-4888-adec-91f94bdd8086.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Solomon's Key","Overview":"Solomon's Key is a platform game with both action and strategy elements.

The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points.\n\nThere are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.","Publisher":"Elite Systems Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=81OZaSTt8JQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Buggy_Boy"},"122476":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"TAD Corporation","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"b874b01e-ffaf-45e4-a301-3980dd55fc07.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"b9cf91a4-b3f6-4eb2-8fb6-80eafab1499d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"9d12ce18-a160-49d1-8a52-7a02880996c4.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d4133168-c550-45cb-b4cc-f5e89c0918f1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6405c17a-a846-4972-bb7c-7892d11fb35f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Cabal","Overview":"Cabal offers one player and two-player-simultaneous modes of gameplay. Each player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. There are 5 stages with 4 screens each. The player starts with a stock of three lives and uses a gun with limitless ammunition and a fixed number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and attack the base. The commando is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall which can be damaged and shattered by enemy fire. To stay alive, the player needs to avoid enemy bullets by running left or right, hiding behind cover, or using a dodge-roll. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (which collapse rather than shatter) are brought down. When the enemy gauge is emptied, the level is successfully completed, all of the remaining buildings onscreen collapse, and the player progresses to the next stage. If a player is killed, he is immediately revived at the cost of one life or game overs if he has no lives remaining. Boss fights, however, restart from the beginning if the only remaining player dies.","Publisher":"Taito","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XH_V1T4x1m0","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cabal_(video_game)"},"122486":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Count Duckula"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Enigma Variations Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"fd12159b-8650-435e-a9c0-a9ab24e85864.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f56ad038-3b57-41e8-964f-9e87f461cde3.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b95a5364-fe63-4d30-b8c1-150ea4038b9f.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"be0f5c07-0e1a-45cd-bff7-98cba4f0af8d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ea91343a-fb2b-4071-aaaf-bf1844bf7898.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3650d4bc-9562-440c-952c-2a04d408add2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Count Duckula: No Sax Please, We're Egyptian!","Overview":"The game is a basic jump and run platform-type game.

The object is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear, to which the object of Columns is similar. \n\nKlax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen. It constantly rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area, which can be moved left and right to catch the blocks and deposit them either in the playing area (which can hold 25 blocks in a 5X5 arrangement) or push them back up the conveyor belt. The device can hold up to five blocks. An uncaught block is considered a \"drop\". A flashing block can be used as a wildcard on any colour. In the playing area, blocks can be eliminated by arranging three or more of the same color into a continuous line, known as a \"Klax.\" The line may be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. A multiple grouping (e.g., one vertical and horizontal) counts as multiple Klaxes, as does Klaxes of four same-colored blocks (two Klaxes) or five same-colored blocks (three Klaxes). Once the goal is reached, bonus points are awarded for remaining blocks on the conveyor belt and device, and empty spaces in the bin (also, on levels where a certain point total is required, points in excess of the required amount are counted both in the scoring and as bonus points).[citation needed]\n\nKlax consists of 100 levels grouped into blocks of five. At the beginning of the game and after each fifth level (levels divisible by five, except for Levels 95 and 100), a player can choose to skip five or ten levels. Skipping levels gives bonus points and a higher drop allowance. The game ends when the player either exhausts their drop allowance, fills up their playing area, or finishes level 100","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Klax_(video_game)"},"122637":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tiertex","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"53ec2150-9632-4a6d-9108-62bca90ff1d2.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"33c2e8a1-af5f-4836-81e7-6d46ef269643.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d93455dc-e0e1-44ec-9c01-11bb5005781c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9447daf8-5179-41a9-9062-cf50b2c9096b.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game","Overview":"As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail.

Control of an island allows you to set what type of island it is, whether resource, factory or defence. Resource islands produce the basic materials that are used by the other islands to produce various supplies including weapons.\n\nAll of the islands are connected via a supply network with the player designating one island as his stockpile. If the connection from the players headquarters (his original island) to the stockpile island is cut off then the flow of supplies will cease.\n\nThe carrier can launch Manta remote-controlled aircraft for recon and combat and Walrus remote-controlled amphibious vehicles for colonisation and conquest of the various islands.\n\nThe filled-in 3D vector graphcs of the game were groundbreaking at the time and gathered a lot of praise, the game also featured a sampled theme song which was included on a casette tape with certain releases of the game.","Publisher":"Rainbird Software","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JypAf87c5t8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carrier_Command"},"125008":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Geoff Crammond","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"640269a8-e2e8-4de3-8f1e-daa6e32de41d.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0cb33197-4484-4e5d-8131-bc0c51f0b3e9.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a4c85ff6-1e27-4aaa-a94d-b65b48b5f625.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cb730610-7d34-42b2-85f3-c07747ad8e3a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a9640c2c-5198-4d8b-8f16-01c8889ed277.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Stunt Car Racer","Overview":"In a departure from typical racing games, in Stunt Car Racer the player is racing upon an elevated race track with a variety of 'stunt' elements.

The evening's performance must bring in that money or the circus will be seized. The bank does not play fair, though: they send the evil clown Fiendish Freddy to sabotage the acts.\n\nThe performance consists of six different events. There is a practice mode for single events, and up to five players can compete in the full game, but must reach the $10.000 on their own, not together. The money is awarded by a jury after each act.\n\nThe acts are:\n\nHigh Diving: Horace the High Diver must jump from a platform and land on a target down below. While falling, Horace must be kept spinning by moving the joystick while at the same time staying over the target. Once he is spinning fast enough, he must perform a pose indicated on the screen by pulling the joystick in a certain direction, after which a new pose is required, continuing until Horace hits the target (or the ground). If completed successfully, the next dive begins from a higher platform, giving Horace more time to perform the poses, while the target gets consecutively smaller. Money is awarded for performing poses if the target is hit. Freddy comes into play if Horace doesn't make a pose in time: he blows Horace off course with a giant fan.\n\nJuggling: Jeffy Joe drives across the arena on a unicycle and must catch and juggle items thrown to him by his seal assistant. The act ends successfully after a time limit is up and fails if Joe drops five items. Joe must be maneuvered so that the items land in his outstretched hands. Pushing fire throws the item in his left hand and moves the items in the right hand to the left. In higher levels, a baby comes into play which Joe must throw in such a way that it lands in a carriage. Freddy tries to sabotage the act by distracting the seal and then throwing dangerous items like bombs and missiles. If either is dropped, the act is over. Bombs however can be thrown back to Freddy.\n\nTrapeze: Finola must cross the big top by swinging on bars. She gains momentum through joystick moves and must then jump to the next bar by hitting fire at the correct moment. After a while, Finola must also maneuver through obstacles like paper targets and flaming hoops, which sometimes bob up and down. If Finola takes too long hanging on a bar without going forward, Freddy will arrive flying via helicopter blades and cut the ropes.\n\nKnife Throw: Knancy Knife has been blindfolded and strapped to a rotating wheel along with a number of balloons. There is a time limit and a limited number of knives to throw. The goal is of course to pop all the balloons without hurting Knancy. If she is hit, she screams out and several knives are removed from the stock. Freddy tries to sabotage the act by occasionally throwing smoke bombs for confusion.\n\nTightrope: Tony Tiptoe tries to cross the tent on a tightrope. He is moved forward by pushing up on the joystick. He will soon begin to lose his balance and must be put back straight by corrective joystick movements to the left or right. If his balance gets really off, his balance pole turns red and he screams out \"Whoa\". If he remains in this position for more than a second, he falls off and it's over. Freddy has several tricks up his sleeve in this act: if Tony takes too long too cross, he pulls out a cannon and blasts him out of the way. In later levels, he flies around the tent and tries to push Tony off or throws saw blades at him. These can be deflected with the pole by pressing fire.\n\nCannonball: Fernando, the Human Cannonball climbs into a cannon to be shot across the big top and hopefully land on his target. His assistant Lisa loads the cannon with a random amount of gun powder, which determines the thrust. Afterwards, the target must be placed somewhere along the tent, moving it closer or farther away depending on the amount of gun powder loaded. Once that is done, Lisa lights the fuse and the cannon starts rotating. It must be stopped at the right angle by pushing fire, which launches Fernando, hopefully towards the target and not the ground. Freddy comes into play when placing the target. Taking too long allows Freddy to put a giant cork into the cannon, with explosive results.","Publisher":"Mindscape, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CaACG1OG-ps","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fiendish_Freddy's_Big_Top_O'Fun"},"130405":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Team Shinobi","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"4d0255fd-6e77-4fba-9ac4-3c5ffb3d2fe0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0e3a3a51-b251-483f-aeec-d94d01ea1f68.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"153b8571-2bf8-4b74-a0c0-70f9c4836226.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Alien Storm","Overview":"The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the \"Alien Busters\" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.\n\nWhen you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.\n\nWhen you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.\n\nAt the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. \n\nYou can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E00QXxdIlro","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alien_Storm"},"130407":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paragon Software","Genres":"Fighting; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"d50e0d6a-0c7b-46a7-a72a-3b6cfea97ffc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"61c825e7-2bb0-4b5e-b46e-7ee8d917e3da.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a3a5cf96-7b93-4739-8f65-1b6389368753.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"The Amazing Spider-Man and Captain America in Dr. Doom's Revenge!","Overview":"Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel superhero is not enough to stop him.

The player takes control of Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.\n\nFlashback: The Quest for Identity incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a \"cinematic platformer\" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.\n\nWhile a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground. \n\nTo defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas. \n\nMost of the versions utilize cutscenes with polygonal vector graphics. The CD versions replace those with pre-rendered 3D animations.

You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.\n\nThe R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called \"The Force\", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).\n\nThe stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/R-Type"},"132748":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Creative Materials","Genres":"Action; Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"cd55eb78-6634-415b-9594-7c68b87326f3.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"79b14db3-b86a-4c9e-a306-6a4490c9532c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"982d7a3c-cdc8-4cd9-8858-4315022fa385.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c274b09d-7a8f-4ef2-86d9-432b61b37f95.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"944152e6-ca15-4dde-bb4c-61ae289a9503.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf979c9b-fed0-44fc-878e-a4039c3c3fc5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Final Fight","Overview":"The streets of Metro City are filled with criminals who are part of a gang called Mad Gear.

You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. \n\nIf you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. \n\nThere are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). \n\nNot all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. \n\nScientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. \n\nHow your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.","Publisher":"MicroProse","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Civilization_(video_game)"},"135215":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gasoline Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"55e7a011-f095-4156-be7c-49756ad6ff6a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5b4dedb8-1082-4c0a-b8c3-7005b3782780.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a0534c66-3f59-476e-bd1b-90742e598420.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Turbo GT","Overview":"In the game you are a racer on the circuit with three other racers.

In 1927 a treasure hunter called Howard Kelp dons a diving suit and searches for the bullion in the wreck.\n\nTreasure Trap is an isometric action game similar to Head Over Heels, but less abstract in its theme. The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited amount of \"smart fishes\", trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the enemies in the room. \n\nSince the player starts with 2 fishes and only receives a new one at each 80 gold bars collected, most of the time the enemies have to be avoided by staying away or jumping over them. Stacking boxes and other objects stops the fauna from getting to the character (and also allows access to high places). There's an air gauge that is constantly depleting at the bottom-right of the screen. It can be filled with the compressed air tanks scattered in some rooms. Some doors require geometric-shaped keys. These can be collected and stored in three slots at the bottom-left of the screen. The game allows saving at each 50 gold collected.","Publisher":"Electronic Zoo","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"137833":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sean Ellis","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b2d5da69-4cee-49d1-98a0-a2fbfc8ed67e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e8d75a0b-ea11-4470-b7e8-2829db9d899f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f592214b-a322-44c8-9db5-101c2a220840.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5b1677cc-1992-41b9-a61b-41b3a8d0c696.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4ce5a4ae-c6a8-488e-af4c-54bef2f33194.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Jade Stone","Overview":"A beautifully illustrated text and graphics adventure by Linda Wright in which you play Amora, the beautiful daughter of Lord Senidea of Nulon engaged to Amanton, a man that your father does not approve of.

The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.\n\nSolving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together. Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis. Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.\n\nBefore solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge. Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith. Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz. If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=j3ihsH5EYZc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/221B_Baker_Street_%28video_game%29"},"137853":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Shelbourne Software","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"cd5f593d-ff59-4104-b19c-553e4ab3081b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f27e0043-2051-4c79-ac9f-916697811640.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df0b35f4-3e52-4d7d-a7fb-7362cfcfe274.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"3-D Break-Thru","Publisher":"Antic Software"},"137854":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c568d124-898e-48e2-bccb-43cc54e7ca24.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"568729bf-be50-4979-ba74-1f79034c7aa8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c2c0a9d0-84d4-432f-aef3-491aad80e4ec.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"443ba0ab-0c87-4e5f-a0ba-57718471c08a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a6f878bc-0990-484e-8bbc-3a33c71e05f0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6078bde3-bc6a-4c82-9847-8bd3a855940c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"62be6ed1-7a81-4587-9cab-c873ab38d9ed.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9ad23afd-4fe6-42f7-ba04-0e14e71fa036.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"2:1 Bar","Overview":"Includes:\nSystem 8 - The Pools Predicator, Turf-Form - Beat the Bookie!.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"137855":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"100-4-1"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Howard Clarke","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"d165b7a7-52fd-4ca5-89fa-f9ce0fbe3360.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f1722279-5a58-4a73-a50a-c006e57b541e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3341b57b-1aaa-4ddf-bd4f-a122c063a35c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"100 4 1","Overview":"The object of the game is to place as many of the 100 tiles as you can. \n\nUse the mouse to select which of the currently available tiles you want and place it on the grid following these rules:\n\nThe first tile must go onto the grid on the star square.

At the \ntime you start, he just cannot help looking at his fans. You \nstart by moving the joystick forwards when you hear the gun (if \nyou do it before, it's a false start).

It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).\n\nADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.\n\nThere's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.\n\nYou navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.","Publisher":"Futura","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Advanced_Destroyer_Simulator"},"137874":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tim Mann","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"f6753d64-a5f7-431b-905c-93e38d8bfab0.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a60e956f-2a28-4c24-b37d-70c16e899d91.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7d9f43e9-88a6-4af1-be78-b7b9ff75ea7f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"20b0f6a7-13f6-4a63-a5e6-dc8646005ce7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"398d7c04-12f8-4c92-84be-b013ce8b4551.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3e0b85b0-e547-4296-8b99-be2ddcaa5a7f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2825494b-5dd8-4eff-8959-4d44f6674985.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Advanced Fruit Machine Simulator","Overview":"It's not a mega thrilling 3D shooter, but it does what it says on the box!

The game was developed by members of Factor 5 pseudonymously as \"New Bits On The RAM\", and was first published as a covermounted disk on Amiga Fun magazine. The game was later available in 1992 as public domain software, with the Amiga version reviewed in issue 18 of Amiga Power.\n\nThe various enemies in the game are based on characters from other titles, such as Bubble Bobble, Nebulus, R-Type, and Super Mario.

The player pilots a \"Mobile\", a craft which bounces off of the platforms that fill the rooms. The player can rotate the craft left and right, thrust it forward, and move the camera up and down for optimal viewing. The game contains 256 rooms, which the player explores while in search of 16 crystals and 16 cubes. The Mobile bounces from platform to platform, making its way around the room to the doors that lead into other rooms. On the way, the player encounters many other creatures and vehicles, as well as surprises, such as rooms with reversed gravity.\n\nThere are two modes of play: Emotion and Action.\nIn Action, players start in the central room, and work their way around with a time limit. Players gain time when going into a room they haven't been in before, and when crystal or cube power-ups are picked up. When time runs out, the Mobile explodes and the game ends.\nIn Emotion, players can choose to start in any of the 12 regions into which the 256 rooms are grouped. The regions are arranged in the context of different areas of the human brain. While there is no timer, players also can't explore beyond the region that is chosen.","Publisher":"Infogrames Europe SA","ReleaseType":"Released"},"138306":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Markus Dheus","Images":[{"FileName":"5490671b-f695-4885-a5dd-a90bd7d15c99.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"da320b63-5545-4689-99bd-ad65a663cec9.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Anduril","Overview":"This should feel instantly familiar to those old enough to remember an old ZX Spectrum game called Kokotoni Wilf. Anduril is a high-resolution PD game by Markus Dheus from all the way back in 1986 and features a winged hero stuck inside a 2D world of object collecting. Like the Speccy game, this is a flick screen platformer which contains many well-designed rooms for us to explore on our item collect journey. Unfortunately, unlike Kokotoni Wilf, our hero cannot walk nor even touch the landscape scenery - doing so means an instant loss of a life!\n\nThankfully, he can put those wings to good use and manoeuvre in a similar fashion to a flappy bird. The controls are extremely simple: use the SHIFT key to fly with H + J turning you left or right. I imagine Anduril is beginning to sound rather easy? You couldn't be more wrong and anyone that loves a challenge will certainly get that here. The first couple of screens are easy but it isn't too long before the game's true sadistic nature is exposed. Most of the map is made up of incredibly tight spaces with which to guide our hero. If that wasn't tough enough, once gravity is factored in, Anduril soon becomes a distressing adventure for all but a calm and patient gamer. Indeed, very challenging.\n\nThe graphics are crisp and nicely detailed but I did sometimes notice odd issues with collision detection, which often worked in my favour so I shouldn't complain too much! Sounds are almost non-existent with only a low-volume spot effect for an item pickup. However, I can live with annoying quirks if the gameplay measures up and (after mastering a vicious learning curve) it definitely does. Anduril is one seriously addictive game and I highly recommend!!"},"138308":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Adrian Keylock","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"bea4ed26-c4a1-418e-af95-f948d71962ba.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9feaae0c-e4d1-455d-956f-83431d4ec7da.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Andromeda","Overview":"An obnoxious bunch of space pirates have been foolish enough to invade your galaxy and you have bravely volunteered to rid the universe of their unwelcome presence.

It was produced by Pete Cook. The sound is credited to Imagitec, and was composed and arranged by Barry Leitch.\n\nTagline: Probably the strangest game ever!\n\nHarlequin takes place across multiple eight-way scrolling levels, each one of which is completely unique, featuring different scenery and enemies. Your character, a harlequin, has returned to his homeworld, Chimerica, to mend its broken heart. To do this, he must find the four pieces that the heart has broken into and take them to the central clock tower.\n\nFinding the pieces of the heart involves a fair deal of strategy and puzzle-solving. Almost every location contains switches that, if flicked, can open up new areas of the current level or change things in different levels, creating new pathways through the game and closing others. Completing the game is thus made more difficult, because the game world evolves as the player interacts with it. You don't have to play through the levels in any particular order to complete the game, but you may often come to a dead end and have to retrace your steps in order to flick a switch you missed, thereby opening up a new route. Some levels need to be revisited several times if you want to make progress, and particularly important changes to the game world actually show up on the map that appears between levels, offering clues as to where you should go next.\n\nEach level has a different setting and graphics style. Most of them are quite weird, happening for example inside a giant clock tower, across the rooftops of a city, or in Egyptian or Mayan mythology (called \"The Dream Mile\"). There is a level where you are sucked through a maze of drinking straws (called \"Suck It and See\"), like a bonus level in that it is packed with health power-ups. Each screen also has a background music tune, but some tunes are shared between several screens.\n\nPower ups include a burger (for health), a space hopper (grants invulnerability and higher jumping), fire-works (a sort of partial shield that orbits Harlequin) and an umbrella that can be used as a parachute. There is also a fish power-up that allows Harlequin to turn into an angel fish when in contact with water.\n\nHarlequin is mostly noted for its good-quality graphics and music and the sheer size of the levels it takes place in, as well as some of its twisted humour and 1990's pop-culture references (e.g. The \"Matey\" bubble bath bottles in the swimming pool","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"141954":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"9bf0f6cb-9b29-4350-8de0-7447331831ef.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a7a8b625-9cdc-48ae-bf30-eeeef0f4a1a8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c4299f3f-dc47-40f2-a1ff-d54b70af382b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"68cff870-d816-42eb-a073-fcbfc64e1169.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a625ba37-3341-4682-8e42-f198c987a3c4.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"db44230c-3c02-4627-b328-b8e4899a6923.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"eeefc6e4-fae5-4b41-b490-9dda395e8398.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Drivin' Force","Overview":"Drivin' Force is a great game for driving maniacs.

The first two players control returning heroes Billy and Jimmy Lee respectively, while the third player controls a new character named Sonny (a yellow-clad palette swap of the Lee brothers). The controls consists of an eight way joystick and three buttons once again, but the combat system has been greatly altered from previous games. The game discards the directional attack buttons from Double Dragon II: The Revenge, returning to the punch and kick format of the original Double Dragon. However, moves such as the elbow strike and the hair grab had been removed and new abilities were added in their place. The player can now run by pushing the joystick left or right twice and perform moves with a second player such as a back-to-back hurricane kick when standing near each other and a triangle jump kick when one player jumps towards the other. Other new moves include a running head-butt, a belly-to-back throw and a jumping knee drop.\n\nAt the start of certain stages, players will have access to an item shop where they can purchase in-game power-ups such as faster attack speed or new moves by using real money. The item selection vary between stages and each one cost a single credit.\n\nOne item, \"Extra Guys\", allows the player to control one of three new character types in addition to the Lee brothers (リー兄弟). These characters form other teams of fighting siblings as well, allowing each player to control a different member of the group. When the player's current fighter is killed, the new one will replace him, essentially substituting the extra lives system from previous games. These new fighters consists of the Urquidez brothers (ユキーデ兄弟) (mixed martial arts champions), the Chin brothers (陳兄弟) (tai chi experts) and the Ōyama brothers (大山兄弟) (karate masters). Each player can hold up to three extra fighters in reserve and availability of a fighter type varies depends on the stage.\n\nThe Japanese version of Double Dragon 3 was produced after the game was already distributed in North America and Europe and features drastic changes as a result. Most notably, the item shops were removed from the game and players can now choose which character to control at the start of the game, allowing the ability to start the game as any of three new fighter types (Urquidez, Chin and Ōyama) in addition to the Lee brothers. The player has access to his character's entire repertoire of moves, although the command input for the Hurricane Kick requires more precise timing in the Japanese version. Since weapons are no longer purchasable items, they can be found lying around on the floor in certain stages, waiting to be picked up by the player if he's controlling a Lee brother. The game was also made easier, with enemies doing 1\/3 less damage than in the overseas releases.","Publisher":"Storm","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"141960":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"de41f132-12aa-4253-82bf-7d627c17ab2d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"4fe959c3-2b6f-46c3-824e-86e00c2c1ae8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d0a43786-17fe-42ba-badf-4cae57c57757.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"01f97489-74fe-480b-a41a-200cdfe9fa69.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8af4406e-d7f8-4434-87c9-da7eb88ebc32.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dynablaster","Overview":"It's the ultimate blast for up to 5 players!

However, Thornahuun managed to possess his son's soul and corrupt it. Tar declared himself Lord Tarbos and brought terror to the land of Lyramion, before being locked away in a secure prison on the world's red moon. Now, a sorcerer named Marmion is trying to release him, with the intention of spreading horror through the land. A lone adventurer from the town of Twinlake must gather thirteen pieces of a powerful artifact known as Amberstar to prevent that from happening.\n\nAmberstar is a role-playing game which uses a top-down view for overworld travel and most indoor locations, and switches to a first-person pseudo-3D perspective when exploring cities and dungeons. Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted. Choice of classes affects attributes, character growth, imposes equipment restrictions, etc. When leveling up, characters can train in specific locations, increasing attributes of the player's choice.\n\nEnemy encounters may occur at specific points in the overworld, or by approaching a visible enemy in a dungeon. The view then switches to overhead, with the combatants displayed on a small grid next to a window graphically presenting the enemies. The fighting is turn-based and offers various defensive and offensive options, including tactical movement on the grid and 90 different spells.\n\nAlthough certain items must be procured and quests completed, the game is largely non-linear, and the player is free to roam the world of Lyramion from the onset. Besides traveling on foot, horses can be bought for safe crossing of shallow water, boats and rafts for sailing, and additional means of transportation as the game advances. The game features a multiple-topic conversation system with prominent NPCs, side quests to undertake, an auto-mapping feature in towns, a day-and-night cycle that may affect NPC movements and shop schedules, and usage of rations when camping to restore lost life points. Progress can be saved at any time, but there is only one save slot that is automatically overwritten.","Publisher":"Thalion","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amberstar"},"145374":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Foursfield","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"0a053ca0-2663-4095-ac57-c32cd4da9448.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2f5947a9-2cb8-46ba-86ad-292a8fe1d9c8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Brat","Overview":"In Brat you must guide a baby, Nathan, through levels with features such as dynamite, bridges and holes.

They created two rings of power which, worn together, made the wearer invincible. Unfortunately, the evil necromancer Lord Dragos has found one of these rings and has come to great power. The only hope to prevent him finding the second one is Reis, a young boy possessing some innate magical ability.

Its box featured artwork by Chris Achilleos. The plotline identifies the player as a champion of Trazere who, after recruiting up to three fellow champions, travels through dungeons and mazes fighting creatures along the way to find and destroy the evil Zendick, and banish the Lord of Entropy.\n\nAll of the champions fall into the four classes of Warrior, Mage, Adventurer or Thief, each with their own particular capability. Within each class there are four characters available, each with their own colour of Red, Blue, Green or Yellow. Each colour also has its own particular advantage, largely with respect to the families of spells the character will be most adept at casting and developing. However, that colour is also important when it comes to matching up coloured rings later in the game to magnify the effects of spell-casting.\n\nOne particularly memorable quirk of the game is the ability granted to players to hold simple conversations with traders, other champions, and even enemies during combat. Stock pseudo-medieval phrases such as \"Truly my courage is remarkable\" and \"Begone, thou oaf\" are selected using a menu, and can be used in combination to flatter a desired companion, aggravate an enemy, or lower the price of an item which the player wishes to purchase. Many gameplayers have found that the price of a long sword (RRP 10 gold pieces) can fall to as little as 6 or 7 after the shopkeeper has been buttered-up with phrases such as \"Thou seems fine\" - particularly when this strategy is used in conjunction with the Beguile spell (most effectively cast by Megrim).","Publisher":"Image Works","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bloodwych"},"154862":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"c413cac8-f833-4bec-9c9e-229014c468ff.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"20ea7017-a183-4f96-852e-539979a11648.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b21eba7b-2cbe-4440-bd47-33d39be994e7.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"908d1d05-902b-45e0-91cf-7fd2607605e3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c7fed3b8-4de4-489e-9fd1-df616b64c761.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b9cadfe3-e53a-418f-919d-386dbd1f5d6e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7cba20b0-ac1e-4fde-a142-17c89aa6fbf3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d98c5971-02ae-4d56-83b9-4480c3f173c1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Road Runner","Overview":"Road Runner a racing game based on the Wile E.

The Dark Shadow is the entity responsible for the events in Bubble Bobble. The game is set on a chain of ten islands, each one with a different theme. Each island provides four rounds of game-play, and once these are complete the player moves to the next island in the chain. In each round the player must get to the top before the sea level rises and kills them. The islands get progressively more difficult, with enemies moving much faster on the later ones. These are depicted on a map screen before the start of each island.\n\nPlayers can release rainbows that act as weapons, makeshift platforms, and item collectors. Slinging rainbows damages any enemies and acquires any items that the rainbows come in contact with. When jumped upon, they fall down, beating any enemies below them, and releasing a damage field above them. Collecting power-ups increases the player's speed, the speed of the rainbows and how many are spawned. If players take too long in a level, water will start to rise up from the bottom of the stage, and will kill the player character if it rises above his head.\n\nLike Bubble Bobble before it, the game has multiple endings. To get the \"True and Happy\" ending the player must find and complete the three secret islands (although most consumer versions of the game completely lack the secret islands because of budget constraints). These islands are not visible until all 7 big diamonds are collected. To get a big diamond, the player must collect seven different-colored small diamonds on the island and finish the round. The small diamonds are found by destroying enemies by dropping a rainbow on them from above or destroying them with various special items. After collecting the small diamonds, a word \"NICE\" appears. If the small diamonds are collected in the correct order, the player will get to a secret room at the end of each island, which contains a permanent power up. The color of the small diamonds depends on where the fallen enemies land, so the player can somewhat determine which diamond colors will drop.\n\nThe scoring system also has secrets, which allow vastly higher scores to be achieved than normal.","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BuV-YwjVRbQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rainbow_Islands:_The_Story_of_Bubble_Bobble_2"},"154933":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mindscape","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"8bb6743e-3648-4c37-b069-2db666547b58.png","Region":"World","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"774f237f-ba94-4f72-bda9-31d03eddcac4.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"aea0549e-7fb0-4d16-b93f-6d179555ab3e.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0cfb624b-3030-4ba0-b093-4bf68ba86319.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"9130847a-b864-4d8a-a4a6-fc53506f755c.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3f745d1c-a2e4-4f2d-a2fa-20157ef8bb1e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"788329b8-573c-47ba-9fa0-8677e42b2936.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3400c5b3-1b37-4b41-8028-b9026db482ad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cdbcd27b-b83f-423e-aec2-c9bc49a3a4d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Captive","Overview":"You awake in prison, without the memory of who you are, where you are and why you are imprisoned.

However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.\n\nIn fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens.\n\nUp to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination. Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads.\n\nEach location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent). When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours.\n\nApparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.","Publisher":"Loriciels Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"163452":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Alien Thing: Expert Edition"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"999 Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"63022ae8-fb80-47ae-b072-44bb3352241d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"96a8da87-c709-4d55-8260-c19145982ae7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"723a8087-61a7-4406-84e0-063443875e82.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9baa9034-73dc-4c13-97c2-18ff769fd111.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"93259b9f-30b6-4a9d-9b6f-5aba0edda9df.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9618598a-e5b3-496a-86c2-54d7cb8262bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4cdd7fd9-d226-4b87-b494-826f54fdbd9d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0f55ef90-b875-4a35-8e64-92128dee363a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1ea02137-b420-4565-84cb-1bde49439700.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Alien Thing","Publisher":"Top Byte Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1995,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PO2ep5fsDJM"},"163453":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Short Grey","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Accrosoft Editon","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3340052f-e91a-4e43-a8b8-9dc6ddd0338e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"611d6d9d-14f4-42a7-a1e2-97c71b978eec.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"50c5b9be-93a5-4b38-b4a2-087764d49db7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fc0f1262-3616-4d56-ba77-1217f3bf7cec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b56dedd6-aa1a-4cef-a1e2-d81764cb0151.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9225b51d-3116-4e44-bf42-636951931f0a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Short Grey","Overview":"The Short Gray is an adventure video game developed and edited by Accrosoft , released in 1992 on Amiga and Atari ST .

It was published for the Amiga and Atari ST by Electronic Arts. The objective is to collect all the litter and find the exit to the level. The game was not a huge commercial success and contained rather experimental styles of gameplay for its time, as well as a quirky sense of humour.\n\nQuiffy must collect all of the various pieces of litter on the level and then find the exit to complete each level. In general the litter is not particularly hidden, it is just distributed around the level. Quiffy can climb on most walls and ceilings, and swim through water. He has energy which depletes upon touching dangerous objects, but can also die instantly when touching any of the few lethal objects. Although he can swim and has the appearance of an amphibious life-form, he can only breathe above water and will start to drown if he runs out of air. \n\nIn each level, you are followed by the ghost of your Aunt Matilda. She copies your movements exactly and starts off about 15 seconds behind you. However, she is very slightly faster than you and will eventually catch up with you. Touching the ghost will hurt Quiffy. \n\nMost of the levels have taps in them, which pour water in to the level. The modelling of the water was quite advanced for a home computer game of its time; the water will flow to the lowest point that it can and when multiple taps are pouring water in one place, it will fill up proportionally fast. A lot of levels feature taps in all areas so the entire level will eventually flood, leaving Quiffy with no available source of air. This aspect is how the game derives its title.","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flood_(video_game)"},"164537":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"ReVenge of the Mutant Cames II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Icon Design","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"b9d2cf8b-620a-4f16-99f3-662d3db45d5f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30c8418f-0be1-40f1-b16e-6100dccb5982.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"27b68ebf-c1b9-4d7c-8e2f-fe34e4771eb8.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ae9c04e7-26a5-4df3-b659-6d4393f82364.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Revenge II","Overview":"Llamasoft developed a sequel to Revenge of the Mutant Camels entitled Revenge of the Mutant Camels II for the PC.

In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack. Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"164559":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"132933a8-415c-4d50-9edc-49ca6fa41863.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1281c1b4-bd0f-446d-91dd-d4b812344348.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ddfef8d4-9077-4e98-b0fa-94c39a0ae5cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Thrust","Overview":"The aim is to pilot a spacecraft which must pick up a pod using a tractor beam and fly it into space. The ship and pod are subject to gravity and inertia, and being connected by a stiff rod can end up spinning around each other, out of control. Hitting the walls of the cave with either the ship or the pod results in death. \n\nEach planet has turrets which fire bullets at the ship, which can be destroyed with a single shot, and a reactor which powers the defence system of each planet. If the reactor is shot enough the turrets will cease firing for a short amount of time. Hitting the reactor with many bullets causes it to go critical and destroy the planet in 10 seconds - the ship must escape into space before this happens, with or without the pod (more points are gained if the pod is present). \n\nFuel is needed to manœuvre the ship and can be collected with the tractor beam, if the ship runs out of fuel the whole game is over. A shield is also available, although when activated it uses fuel and the ship cannot shoot. \n\nLater levels have doors that are opened by shooting a panel. After all 6 levels have been completed the levels start again, but first with gravity reversed, then with the planet and walls invisible unless the shield is used, and finally with invisible walls and reverse gravity.

The number of points that a team receives for scoring a goal starts at 10 but can be increased to 15 or 20 via the use of score multipliers located on the walls of the pitch. The same number of points for scoring a goal is given for injuring a player from the opposing team. When a player is injured, he is replaced by one of three substitutes. If all three substitutes are injured, the injured player will be forced to return to the game and play on in spite of his injuries.

SOFEL released a port for the NES in 1991, as KlashBall. It was re-released in 2004 as one of the 30 games on the C64 Direct-to-TV.\n\nThe game is played by two teams on an enclosed court with a goal at each end, similar to that of ice hockey or five-a-side football. The court contains fixed bounce domes that modify the trajectory and speed of the ball, as well as one hole in the middle at each side where upon entering the ball will appear at the opposite side, keeping its momentum. The layout of the domes on the court changes as the player faces a different team, up to a maximum of 10 variations. \n\nA player has control of only one outfield player on a team at any one time. The game may be played by one or two players; two player games are played competitively. Two game modes are supported: knockout (face increasingly tougher teams controlled by the computer in best of three matches) and league. \n\nThe game starts with the player(s) selecting a captain among three available choices, each starting with significantly more points than the other two in one of three stats: stamina, power and skill. All the members in a team start the game with the same stats. During the actual game, as team members hit opponents, the opponent loses a part of his stamina; when stamina drops low enough, that individual player will move slower than the rest. The more powerful a team member is, the more damage he will deliver with a direct hit. Extra skill on the other hand promotes aggression from any team member controlled by the computer towards the opposite team, and improves chances of a successful hit.\n\nWhile in possession of the ball, the player can either press and immediately release the fire button to do a direct throw, or keep the button pressed to make the ball go higher. Players can then jump to try and catch it, but this makes them more vulnerable to being hit by the opposite team.\n\nAs the game progresses, coins and several power ups appear randomly which can be collected. Power ups include making the ball become electrified (the opposite team can't pick it up and they will take harm if they try), and make it teleport to your player.

If the player is caught in a searchlight, the sniper is shot at and risks being gunned down.\n\nThe second part involves entering the building with the other three men. In some versions of the game, this section is linked to the first part. The player's men abseil down the side of the building to choose which room to enter from, while the snipers who were positioned earlier can be used to shoot the terrorists through the windows.\n\nThe building must then be searched, shooting the terrorists and finding the hostages in the process.

The working title for the game was Foot and Mouth. It uses an isometric engine that is similar to the Filmation technique first developed by Ultimate.\n\nHead Over Heels is the second isometric game by Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond, after their earlier Batman computer game released in 1986. In 1994 another isometric video game by Ritman and Drummond, Monster Max, was released for the Nintendo Game Boy.\n\nThe player controls two characters instead of just one, each with different abilities. Head can jump higher than Heels, control himself in the air, and fire doughnuts from a hooter to paralyze enemies; while Heels can run twice as fast as Head, climb certain staircases that Head cannot, and carry objects around a room in a bag. These abilities become complementary when the player combines them together after completing roughly a sixth of the game. Compared to its predecessors, the game offers unique and revolutionary gameplay, complex puzzles, and more than 300 rooms to explore.\n\nDrummond contributed some famously surreal touches, including robots (controlled by push switches) that bore a remarkable resemblance to the head of Prince Charles on the body of a Dalek. Other surreal touches include enemies with the heads of elephants and staircases made of dogs that teleport themselves away as soon as Head enters the room","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Head_over_Heels_(video_game)"},"164665":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Argonaut Software, Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"5a154a76-aef9-45a4-be8f-e9b278a21d44.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b3dfc866-9b83-4206-a840-e6daf878dedb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3ef345a5-82af-4fe9-b4fa-2093703d5dc3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Starglider 2","Overview":"Starglider 2 is a 3D space combat simulator published in 1988 by Rainbird as the sequel to 1986's Starglider. It was released for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS, Macintosh, and ZX Spectrum. Instead of the wireframe graphics of the original, Starglider 2 uses flat shaded polygons.\n\nThe game features open, continuous gameplay without levels or loading screens after the game had started, despite taking place across an entire planetary system. The player can fly through space, enter a planet's atmosphere, explore the surface, and penetrate subterranean tunnels in one seamless movement. \n\nThe goal of Starglider 2 is to destroy an enemy space station with a neutron bomb, and the majority of the gameplay consists of collecting parts for the bomb, or fulfilling other prerequisites (e.g. finding the nuclear professor capable of constructing the bomb, or trade goods for the bombs necessary to destroy the shield generators protecting the space station), while fighting off enemy spacecraft, and delivering collected items to depots inside planetary tunnel systems. The various objects needed to complete the game are distributed across the many planets of the solar system, as well as in the intervening space (e.g. asteroids and space pirates), or even in the atmosphere of the gas giant planet.\n\nThe flight model is arcade-style as opposed to realistic, as the game features no inertia; the spacecraft banks like an aircraft to turn, in air, outer space, and underground; and it is possible to hover. In addition, the game features many graphic display options, including the ability to eliminate roll, or view the game from outside the cockpit from a non-chase-camera, making it difficult to fly but allowing the player to view the polygonal model of the spacecraft. \n\nThe construction of the shield generators and the space station itself progresses continuously over the course of the game, and failure to destroy the space station before construction was complete will result in loss of the game (the space station would be used to destroy the player's home planet). Successfully destroying the space station will not end the game, despite treating the player to a spectacular explosion and congratulatory text; instead, it will simply reset the construction of the space station, and the player can again begin attempting to gain possession of another neutron bomb with which to destroy the station.","Publisher":"Rainbird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Starglider_2"},"164700":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Probe Entertainment Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"2551973e-4ff3-4651-a723-e0636e58e8d4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"88097fe2-8f03-417d-a251-40bf59b95ee1.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2710a0d8-cae4-4d38-a8c1-8ed7b7385424.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5c4e80c2-9f2d-438d-a2ee-4a25ecba4cf7.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c41f969a-b5a8-43fd-a2b9-958205ec3e3f.png","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"916d838c-6d37-42dd-90d0-a54c571233b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dan Dare III: The Escape","Overview":"In Dan Dare III, Virgin's latest addition to the saga, Dan faces his toughest challenge yet.

But before he can make it work, he must locate 50lbs of fuel in a catacomb of corridors, chambers and shafts.\n\nDan is initially armed with a plasma rifle, a single power shield and handy jet pack. If he can fight his way to the stores computer on the first level he can order from a plethora of weapons stock as long as his credit holds out including extra lives, nuke bombs, homing missiles. But all cost. Once Dan is armed, he selects each weapon by pulling down on the joystick, the current selection being shown by its particular icon.\n\nThe icons are clear and obvious, contrasting sharply with the small graphics of the characters and selection of each icon takes place during play so an element of real time swapping is inherent. While the music is pleasant yet unmemorable and sound effects are too limited, the scrolling most certainly is poor. It jerky and slow.\n\nProbe Software, who are responsible for the game, have a better reputation for graphics then this especially after having made such a good job on the Spectrum, Dan Dare on the Amiga is therefore an enigma – jerky scrolling coupled with reasonable graphics and underused sound make for a game which will be forgotten easily, unless you buy it in which case it will be remembered for its mediocrity.","Publisher":"Virgin Games Ltd","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"164701":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullfrog Productions, Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"fe053077-b1de-4460-98fc-25afdf72740c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"266e6294-4e75-4945-b13c-a71b5333f607.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ee353913-627c-40e6-8fec-5ba90dc2bc19.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"41eaf9a7-e48c-4818-b665-f7ceac4da896.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Populous","Overview":"The main action window in Populous is viewed from an isometric perspective, and it is set in a \"tabletop\" on which are set the command icons, the world map (depicted as an open book) and a slider bar that measures the level of the player's divine power or \"mana\".\n\nThe game consists of 500 levels, and each level represents an area of land on which live the player's followers and the enemy followers.

Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.\n\nThere are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.\n\nYou also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted, you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose, and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane, proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.\n\nThere are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"164816":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Vortex Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"641873bf-12a8-4511-8947-0392ad7ebacf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a48a894-1761-49d4-af70-e346c308b7e0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7855a0df-02f2-4958-b36d-c8953451b7c4.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"H.A.T.E.: Hostile All Terrain Encounter","Overview":"H.A.T.E.: Hostile All-Terrain Encounter is an isometric scrolling shoot 'em up similar to Sega's Zaxxon, developed by Vortex Software and released in 1989 for Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Amiga and Atari ST.\n\nA major gameplay difference from Zaxxon is the ability to play with either an airplane or a tank.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/H.A.T.E.:_Hostile_All-Terrain_Encounter"},"165075":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Eclipse","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b26232ce-3158-40b9-9a2c-0047b22d136a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c37377d8-5b1f-44f7-954b-c42012f35cdc.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1d599538-2ada-4fe6-a6d2-69c0f0fce90e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a09a5409-789b-4609-b3ab-4f06c4f02753.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"550a8114-7426-4516-b0f6-4f153fa7005f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e3b1b263-3c00-4c71-b680-99ef978fbee3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e4831070-cd6f-45f8-9993-47fccf51d507.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ninja Remix","Overview":"The Last Ninja is a series of video games published by System 3.

Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.\n\nEach class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay.\n\nThe circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.\n\nThere is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.","Publisher":"MicroStyle","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xCiCszRliqs"},"166563":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capstone Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Racing; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e6e44bf4-29a2-48c0-88a9-b8b0031fee7e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2520a215-2dab-4742-8fe4-74288d74a3b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f12ea851-0ace-4ac8-93c1-870c5f337366.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a82f6a69-a9bc-49fd-bb9c-52d740ad41c8.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ef247d2d-da46-446e-89f5-4da46f410a59.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Miami Vice","Overview":"You play as Crockett and Tubbs in pursuit of drug dealers. \nYou use your guns, brains, and brawn to fight your way through the levels and chasing the bad guys with your awesome cop car.","Publisher":"Capstone Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QOuycHTKoRg"},"167580":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MicroProse Software Inc","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Strategy; Vehicle Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"52bef5ff-f560-46c9-82e7-de88dffc0c67.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"228179c0-f7fe-4b12-91b3-3bdc25d368c6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5eb64f47-6b01-4d96-a314-2a4bddf0b63b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Silent Service","Overview":"You are now a member of the Silent Service, the US Navy Submarine command.

The bars are filled by collecting blue \"magic potions\" attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack. Various steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice (which also appeared in Altered Beast), which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire depending on its color scheme, is found later in the game. In addition to the main quest, some home versions of the game included \"duel mode\", a survival mode type game that pitted players against increasingly powerful foes in consecutive rounds of play. This mode also featured a two-player one-on-one option.","Publisher":"Virgin Mastertronic Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golden_Axe_%28video_game%29"},"172168":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Atari, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"d64907ad-4714-4b6e-aad9-0226019fba4e.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"6f083cb9-68c9-4548-9d49-b0f760ac7777.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f18f8d1c-ef7e-4b1b-a887-ce29a4607a9c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"81cced9f-7d86-4fa9-8fc3-81b78129192f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1181394c-0fe6-4c0d-ac00-855e28acc428.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a408461-c2cf-4ba4-81c7-3aec04757eb5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"aa3ffa04-6733-4cbc-b71b-4ec457409700.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"d0f63437-7352-49ee-ad05-3fc512bc5ee3.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"3514de87-8b8d-4b93-9b4b-6325a4491aa5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0fea16e8-9196-4039-8215-4ef257efd2f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"957283c2-25d7-49ef-b3bd-7ad9786686ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b24f3631-6fdd-47de-8959-0529d30153e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f1164948-b972-4d07-b8cd-73f4039b520c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"952847c9-baf2-4ed5-a069-7b5bb8f7181d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi","Overview":"The arcade game from Atari based on the third Star Wars movie features three action sequences inspired by the film.\n\nFirst, you control Princess Leia on a speeder bike racing through the forests on Endor.

After everything is destroyed, the jet has to safely return to base.\n\nAll this has to be completed before the jet fuel runs out, effectively giving the player only a few minutes to complete the goals. The main motivational factor is optimizing the high score because the effective measures (e.g. using the rockets or destroying the airport first) give much less points than the hard way.

There are three different types of fighters roaming throughout the galaxy; cruisers, fighters, and basestars. With the help of your galactic map, you can find the sectors of the galaxy where these fighters are located and then warp there to destroy them. When all of the fighters in a sector are destroyed, you can warp to a new location for the next battle. Be sure to keep an eye on your starship's energy level; warping to new locations, being hit by enemy fire, or colliding with an asteroid will drain your energy. If you completely run out of energy, your starship will be destroyed, however you can warp back to a starbase to refuel at any time. Returning to a starbase will also repair other types of damage your starship can receive, such as faulty engines, loss of your shields, and faulty photon torpedoes. When all of the enemy ships have been destroyed, you win the game and receive a rank.","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/jdbaFHzfmvc?t=1","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Raiders"},"176023":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"d3m","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f42033a0-e552-477e-b604-d20c04dccd4a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"17e44be7-07b2-41c0-942f-17d85c17c188.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b4d77623-a02b-47d2-add5-972ad82d8d1b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"62cab9ab-ab5a-4aab-837f-31283690dda9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f136f52c-2533-484b-a8ee-295ce3d368cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Tonic Tile","Overview":"Tonic Tile is a clone of the arcade game Arkanoid.

There are also friendly creatures like dolphins and mermaids (their kiss gives an extra life) and military crates which contain additional gear. Air is limited and has to be refilled at certain parts of the level.\n\nIn level two, the player has to investigate an underwater maze. He needs to find and grab various items which are used at another place to proceed. This section is puzzle-oriented and the action concentrates on obstacles which need to be avoided and single enemies.\n\nLevel three is also a maze in which objects need to be found (a decoder and keys) which need to be brought to a final location. However, it is set on land (Atlantis, to be exact) and therefore air is no longer an issue. The fights take a \"run and gun\" approach where the player shoots a lot of aliens and dodges their attacks.

The polar ice caps have melted, turning the surface of the earth into many islands of decaying land masses, known as Archipelagos. Man then built systems to try to clean up the pollution, but these failed. The only life left were genetically-altered plants made in an effort to clean up the waste -- these also turned hostile. It is up to you to clean up the earth, island by island.\n\nControlling a hoversphere, it is up to you to make Earth's many islands of land habitable. To do this, you need to knock out the radiation generators on each island, which can be done by knocking out each generator's power sources (there are several per island). Once these are knocked out, you have 90 seconds to get back to the generator and disable it before it melts down, taking you with it.\n\nObstacles, unfortunately for you, are plentiful: You can't knock out a power source unless it is connected by a \"land bridge\" to the generator. You have the ability to create land where needed, but this takes up energy, and you have a limited supply. Also a hindrance are the many genetically-altered entities left behind on the islands: Viral trees that poison the ground; necromancers (former hoverspheres) that now erode land instead of creating it; eco eggs that explode on touch; and aircleaners, who are ruthlessly efficient in cleaning up the air -- and everything else, including you.\n\nThe entire game plays from a 3D first-person viewpoint. A movable cursor selects where to move or what to manipulate.\n\nThere are 10,000 islands on Earth to purify. If you can make it past Archipelago #100, you are then free to select any of them.","Publisher":"FanFare","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"178861":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ramware","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"aa1b6c6c-e5ff-49a3-8412-4e1107ea0285.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a730527e-4884-429f-81ec-e13a407bcc6a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b80f917d-9fe4-40e3-a3ac-6f65d446a97d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Atax","Overview":"In the darkest years of the Goverment's oppresive reign, one man had dared to oppose the system.\nHis only weapon?

The ducklings also eat the corn, however.\n\nThere are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.","Publisher":"Pick & Choose Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"178938":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"A&F Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5751324b-1ae5-4ecf-83c4-72ad0f31286c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6365c9f7-2245-4623-a6a8-843e014d646a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ed759b86-e666-4faf-a0a5-5f856be98661.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dd64da4a-15b5-4943-808b-113e0977c8d3.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Chuckie Egg II","Overview":"Chuckie Egg II is a sequel to platformer game Chuckie Egg, but is very different from the original game.

The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called \"tactics\" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.","Publisher":"Erbe Software S.A.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"179300":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Denton Designs","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f213a823-330d-42d5-98cd-36c552087938.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"1019a47f-08da-452f-b4f5-8b8c82cfdfa7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4d830b09-310f-481f-a45c-d59b0ecd4ddb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"37780a7f-c6ba-440f-b890-ddd6747e1e16.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"10d10a50-e6b4-4789-8e3c-f47ff74a70ba.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"55a4c348-6112-4787-9bb7-a7fd2716ce59.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Eye of Horus","Overview":"As a mystical shaman, go through a pyramid in ancient Egypt to get the magical eye of horus.

There are 5 players on each team, on a small court with 2 and 3 point shooting areas.

At the highest vantage point stands The Sentinel, a statue-like being with an energy draining stare, you begin at the lowest. \"Energy\" plays an important role, there's a constant amount in the game world and each object is worth a certain number of units - including you. The object of each level is to absorb The Sentinel and Hyperspace to the next from his vantage point. The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a \"robot hull\" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground. There are a few other elements to the game - on later levels there will be other Sentries positioned around the landscape. If only part of you can be seen i.e. not the square you are standing on, a nearby tree can be changed into a \"Meanie\" which will ultimately force you to teleport. There are 9999 levels in the game but the next level number is based on the current level + how much energy you have remaining.","Publisher":"Firebird","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Sentinel_(video_game)"},"180733":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c2f53d25-ba74-40da-bc1e-f8cefbf6ee7c.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9bab8fe8-5457-4d45-a48a-1e15e2dacc9b.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d1da8b63-a84e-43e8-bbae-79e9c8b67d78.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f48038b7-5329-4ed8-b7de-27ec79919151.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ede7968e-a024-46da-89bc-d55d96405fa1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure","Overview":"It is 1938 and adventurer Indiana Jones is joined by his father on this quest, preventing Adolf Hitler from capturing the Holy Grail.

These were generated by the game aggregating the mass of material within an early solar system into planets and moons that obey the laws of physics, but which have slightly randomised material distribution in order to ensure each system's uniqueness.\n\nIt was followed by Frontier: First Encounters in 1995 and another sequel, Elite: Dangerous in 2014.","Publisher":"GameTek UK Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-29T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frontier:_Elite_II"},"182713":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maelstrom Games Ltd","Genres":"Action; Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7bbe0dfd-7baa-4465-865d-0b381f563ada.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9e21f6d7-dc9f-4cbc-bcf3-718c9d36cf0a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e03bf012-f711-4eea-a50f-502e323fa516.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"20028c09-47f4-4d9d-885b-ee823b86aee6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"584bb370-ea6b-4d48-aa10-3a6291af6316.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b00b5423-2a6a-4854-96a1-20702845fccb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6139ff8d-ff0a-4e27-ac8c-836fd28509e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"a99fe9a2-9d03-42e8-9847-67e0e3df2710.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2387652e-bc0b-4509-9cdd-875f4ea8fd23.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Midwinter","Overview":"Midwinter is set in a post-apocalyptic world, as the Earth entered a nuclear winter caused by the fall of a meteorite. The titular island has been formed in the Azores group of islands, caused by volcanic activity.\n\nThe player initially controls Captain John Stark, the commander of local militia known as Free Villages Police Force (FVPF), who attempt to protect their home from the invasion of armed troops under the command of General Masters. As Stark, the player has to recruit civilians and members of FVPF in order to join forces and prevent Masters from reaching the base located in the south-eastern part of the island.\n\nMidwinter is a hybrid game that combines elements of strategy and action. The player selects and controls the 32 recruits as they attempt to protect the island within a limited amount of time. Two hours of game time are assigned to each recruit; afterwards, the strategy battle moves to the next turn. During their turns, the recruits fight enemy forces in action-oriented combat reminiscent of a first-person shooter. Specific and detailed injuries add a tactical edge to these battles. Enemy units are mostly composed of armed snow buggies, as well as supply vehicles. Eliminating a large amount of them or killing the commander of the unit usually successfully completes the mission.\n\nTerrain plays an important role in the game, as many snow-covered mountain areas are impassable, and the player must plan ahead how to advance. The player can use snow buggies, ski, and cable cars to access the goal.\n\nWhen recruiting characters, the player has to pay attention to their personal relationships. For example, Stark can recruit his girlfriend, but another character will refuse to join because he is in love with her and jealous of the Captain.","Publisher":"Rainbird Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Midwinter_(video_game)"},"182714":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Flames of Freedom"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Maelstrom Games Ltd","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"13206e7b-3c6f-4801-a9d1-32f0c4592b2f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a4a6af25-270d-4522-a672-e2b637c88907.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e76829f0-9433-4564-b622-7080c082b24f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"daf4cfd7-87be-4f10-bfa5-54453c4b6abe.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd275453-f1cd-4549-8ea9-a518c660eddf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7fd1ed9d-3b73-48e6-b1e8-efeda5189651.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"e36a3ab9-0f50-42bd-916d-3f95e8b25b83.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d815fcc3-e11f-40a5-82a1-cfe48d90e242.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8c88383c-daca-4451-a352-b87cca973ea9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4698c23f-7e94-4c06-928b-ab70e8c81e85.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Midwinter II: Flames of Freedom","Overview":"This sequel to Midwinter takes place years after the events of the first game.

Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict. Code-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra's other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command \"Look\" may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Codename:_ICEMAN"},"183569":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"The Colonel's Bequest: A Laura Bow Mystery","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"53ff5dae-3416-487c-b312-0fe675a8a8b4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"56b546ba-daec-465a-96a7-fefb56d63313.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b6cca8c3-58fd-4e67-a84c-9852e5cd83c8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Colonel's Bequest","Overview":"The Colonel's Bequest is a detective mystery adventure game very similar in style and presentation to Agatha Christie's novels. The game world is confined to the island and consists of numerous interconnected areas, such as various rooms in the mansion, garden, smaller structures, etc. The player is free to explore much of the game's world right from the beginning, with only a few areas being initially inaccessible. The game's clock advances a quarter of an hour each time Laura performs an action pertaining to the plot. Characters have their own schedules and clues are often obtained by discretely observing their actions. The player interacts with the environment by typing verb-object command combinations (such as \"Look Garden\", \"Talk Colonel\", etc.). Some of the most common actions have keyboard shortcuts. The gameplay largely focuses on exploration. Much of the plot stays in the background and can be uncovered by talking to the characters about various topics (mostly other people). There is an inventory and a few puzzles, but they play a much less prominent role in the game compared to other adventures by Sierra. It is possible to complete the game without having discovered the entire plot or even without having identified the murderer. There is no scoring system, but after the game is finished the player is given a detective ranking and told about story branches or other elements he might have missed.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"183570":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"magnetic Scrolls","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2ab8b2c5-5abd-428d-a897-9da2c10e410c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5706468c-a2e9-4dd3-9231-c9b1ea692e28.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa94600f-59c1-4857-a0aa-6621e468eefe.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Corruption","Overview":"Corruption is one of Magnetic Scrolls' interactive fiction games.

Like in Bubble Bobble, various objects fall from the screen that can be collected for points, along with more useful power-ups like explosives, extra-time, extra-lives and a special block than fills a slot (it can be shot if it's not needed). Also, if the player takes too long to solve the level a random enemy appears, but it can be killed by the agent's gun. The game starts with 6 lives and has a password system.","Publisher":"Image Works","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"183588":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Mercenary 2: Damocles"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paul Woakes","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"94276406-b69a-41ba-a68f-770bc7365961.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"dc647441-546a-4074-81d2-e130ed262316.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"18c80e54-ba26-4ff8-9edf-25c0905d91c6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"362c36b3-ddbd-4c2f-9301-780bb4e7fce2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e2d31a59-9677-437f-976c-1a374dc5a6a6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"af2afba9-819c-4f43-a643-6bad8025c6f5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7747c171-86c4-4879-ac31-6400aee6f8de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a2816cb0-abc5-4887-be79-b46352e2ba8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"af7ec91e-f368-43df-929b-91a7d8eeaf78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"276a449c-a9bb-4169-a95f-ac77fce42619.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1a346143-ed65-4d73-ba1b-3abb57da78e0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Damocles: Mercenary II","Overview":"In this sequel to the game Mercenary, the planet Eris is in danger: A comet, fittingly named \"Damocles\", is on a straight collision course with the planet.

SSI continue their series of AD&D releases with Dragons of Flame, an action game (like Heroes of the Lance, the first release) set in a mythical world. It's 300 years since the gods abandoned the people of Krynn and as a result, Takhisis, the Queen of Darkness, has awakened some dragons and created an army of Draconians. Once her armies are victorious, she'll be able to rule the land. All that can stop her is a bunch of companions – led by your very own self. The character portraits are all good and while the overhead and side views are basic, they're quite reasonable – at least the sprites respond quickly to key presses. Sound is limited to a few spot effects and these are nothing to write home about. It's simple stuff so it's easy to get into. It's also easy to play and with a bit of application shouldn't take too long to complete. That said, it's not too easy and the difficulty tuning has been set about right. It's definitely an action game and the role-playing elements that creep in give it a nice bit of variation on a straight hack 'n' slash game. Dragons of Flame is definitely enjoyable to start with, but the sheer number of enemies that have to be dealt with takes the edge off the excitement and the whole thing starts to get a shade on the repetitive side. Still, it's certainly a nice easy game to get into and works well as an introduction to the sort of things that happen in 'real' role-playing games.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragons_of_Flame_(video_game)"},"183604":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"2aacdc4c-cbec-465b-90e8-7baeee4375cb.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"754d5700-fd8c-4acc-a2f6-9d515f0da98e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"91ffa2fa-23ea-4094-ba56-46a5e07bd112.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"183616":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Horror Soft","Genres":"Adventure; Horror; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"03697718-cfd3-4db5-a1ac-8f826d128ccd.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c07810d7-bee7-4dfa-b91c-cb0e210f126c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"46cbc796-875f-4257-b1c2-08bae2b95d44.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ff275987-eb80-4e52-b9bd-1bc23b5fd4e7.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus","Overview":"Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure\/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.). For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the \"room\" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases. As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve. Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.","Publisher":"Accolade","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"183617":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Horror Soft","Genres":"Adventure; Horror; Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"77363b3a-732d-41cc-8856-146b921ef58e.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9213bf19-1575-409e-8e7e-88f9eb044dc5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2330b634-eb7a-43ab-b494-527fd3dd78e1.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b07ea40a-425b-433b-a024-06b2a37a065e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"ceca6b5b-a341-438c-9c56-ae155247cb23.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark","Overview":"Elvira: Mistress of the Dark is an adventure game.

With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the \"Championship Special\" part of the title refers. The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match. While Grand Slam got the England team and manager to officially endorse the game (thus having names and photos of 20 squad members from Robson to Gascoigne), they didn't buy the Euro Championship license. You'll be playing seven out of 22 European nations for the \"Champions of Europe\" title in a nondescript international tournament, from group matches to finals. Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at all.","Publisher":"Grandslam Entertainment","ReleaseYear":1991},"183622":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"7ac18b48-e72d-4284-a885-e9d318d341a4.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8194da54-5f6c-4c41-8bb0-409e1cb3f9f1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"47f5231d-2132-42fb-b7aa-e426f7edcc3d.jpg","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Enterprise"},"183623":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"ca11afb5-5b71-4449-9199-404f3e50579a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"f2fd894c-0d51-4780-acdf-caee35171665.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ae183698-b7d1-4776-b872-1758b4b2f4f2.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Epic","Overview":"The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home.

Besides getting the micro film, another objective is to terminate any enemy agents. This is done as in draughts, by jumping over the agent into a free space. Killing enemy agents nets points, which, combined with points for recovered film canisters and surviving agents are tallied for the final score. The board is viewed from above.

Egor must find it, put it in his sack and return to the lab to receive the next task.

Instead of a health bar, Egor has a Frightometer with a range from calm to panic. Touching enemies moves it ever more towards the maximum. Once that is reached, Egor will drop what he is carrying, flee to the lab and in so doing lose a life. There is a way of reducing the meter, though: meeting up with the local serving wench will calm Egor's nerves and return it to zero. It is also reset when an item has been delivered. Once Egor has found and returned the weather chart requested by Frankenstein, the game introduces a time limit. The timer starts at around 74 minutes and counts down to the electrical storm that will bring the monster to life.

While the first two games had a top-down view, Gauntlet 3 has an isometric perspective.

One Ghostbuster is being lowered into a shaft on a cable and must collect the samples at the bottom. On the way down, many ghosts will try to stop him. Some of them try to saw off the cable, others deplete his courage upon touching him. He can destroy them with proton beams or bombs or employ a shield so they can't touch him. Weapon power-ups and elixirs that restore courage can be found on ledges in the shaft and can be reached by swinging. Several parts of a slime scooper must also be collected in this way before the samples can be collected. In the second scene, the Ghostbusters have animated the Statue of Liberty via the slime and with her help must travel to the Museum of Art. Lady Liberty automatically walks to the right and can use her torch to shoot at the many enemy ghosts in her way. Her slime supply drains constantly however. Defeated ghosts drop slime, which can be collected by sending out the little people at Liberty's feet to pick it up and return it so the supply can be refilled. In the third scene, the Ghostbusters confront big bad Vigo in the museum, seen in isometric view. First, all four of them have to be lowered into the museum on ropes, their speed controlled via joystick movements. Dropping too fast can stun them and take them out of the following fight. In the fight, the player can switch between the four guys at any time. Goals are to defeat Janosz, carry away baby Oscar before Vigo can enter him (Janosz will come after Oscar if he's still alive) and finally catch Vigo in the crossfire of two proton beams."},"183652":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"The Bitmap Brothers","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"696c60e8-f545-4604-8c26-41068fdd8af8.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"34c63ce1-9d5a-4cf6-9f67-5a784ad4df10.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"109acd05-d202-4407-b4dc-f3ae6e404640.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"651f0d05-acdb-4b57-800f-1a4145f6351a.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"61e873b6-ab65-47fd-a3b7-452a8e00a0e6.png","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"f35e1a0c-a74e-4e05-90c4-0b00d739be72.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"2ce4bb34-06a6-47af-95eb-1aee8e72a7d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8e13d19e-50b7-4281-be13-55a76a721089.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"eda04623-d0e3-4e7a-a848-1fd5205eff41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"773cf2b0-2211-4abe-87ff-bd6ffa2a3818.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2f02e666-b1be-4a86-bd62-f15ef554a262.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gods","Overview":"Hercules is aiming to achieve immortality by completing the task the Gods have set him.

The game provides three choices: players may select a pre-made character, create their own, or import characters from previous Strategic Simulations Dungeons & Dragons computer games, such as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds. When creating a character, players may determine the character's race (dwarf, elf, human or gnome), character class (cleric, fighter, magic-user or thief), and alignment. Various characteristics of the new character, such as strength and intelligence, are assigned a random value by the computer. There are two aspects to the game: arcade action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as mini-games) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and adventure, where the player completes quests. The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, \"what you do in your time off is up to you\", and thus the player is free to explore other aspects of the game. The game is presented in three modes. When traveling, the scene is presented using a side-on view; once in the town of Hillsfar, the game converts to a \"bird's-eye view\" of the map; a first-person perspective is employed within the caves. Interaction is handled through what Leslie Fiser of Compute! magazine described as a \"bump interface\", which allows the player to trigger interaction with objects by bumping into them.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183685":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"835e5e82-5847-4f89-9b62-d97cfc39e54c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"c9654cf5-b1bd-44bf-8e10-6782895189db.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8fb2c4bc-be2d-42e4-825a-be857fd5b1ef.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Hong Kong Phooey","Overview":"Hong Kong Phooey (full title: Hong Kong Phooey: No. 1 Super Guy), is a platform game that was developed by PAL Developments, Enigma Variations and Twilight for Hi-Tec Software, and released on the systems of the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Commodore Amiga in 1990; it is based on the Hanna-Barbera television series of the same name, which originally aired in 1974 (and was one of their shortest-lived TV cartoons, given that it only ran for thirteen episodes).","Publisher":"Hi-Tec Software","ReleaseYear":1990},"183686":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"b723d406-1b1e-4180-945c-ec61d41723ef.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0fd5a099-1c13-469d-99da-e8c81ce69aaf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7cd9c1e3-7388-42b7-a4d5-849c20f1a15b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"21c6e299-939f-4f6e-a256-119b86d4a616.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"}],"Name":"Hook","Overview":"Peter Banning is an ordinary suburban dad with two kids - or so everyone thinks.

However your tanks will be topped up even further for finish first. The arcade original was pretty simplistic and, as might be expected, the conversion is accurate. Sadly, the arcade machine was not much cop, and that also comes across in the conversion. The graphics and sound are mildly cheering, but the gameplay is thin and watery.

In addition, and although this is a fault of the original coin-op, the actual gamplay is tired and repetitive and made even more annoying thanks to some unavoidable collisions and extremely lax sprite detection.

You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths.

Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, the game offers a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friendly characters may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, but you may restart each level as often as you like.

Unfortunately, it didn't last for long, since Shandar found a way to retain his spirit, which is looking for a body to possess. Using time manipulation, Shandar is trying to find the dragon of Sith, last survivor of the Great Black Dragons, in order to control his body and execute its immense power for evil purposes. Zubaran has to find companions, use the Portals of Time, explore the land, and get to the Black Dragon before Shandar does.\n\nIn the third installment of Ishar series the player can control Zubaran or import characters both from Ishar or Ishar 2. The gameplay is very similar to that of the second game. The player recruits companions and navigates the party through 3D environments viewed from first-person perspective.

These become popular with boy-racers and general speed freaks pretty soon, and that's why you're aiming to hurtle across them in this arcade conversion. The road scrolls vertically, with some moderately sharp bends in a manner similar to Spy Hunter You have a jump device to clear the many jumps, or to land onto and flatten the other maniacs who line the road. You must choose which path to follow at OutRun-style forks in the road. The roads contain bonus tags including bonus points, a battering ram to make contact with other cars more effective, and energy boosts to replenish damage.

It takes place in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups. You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint. Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track. You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit from the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players.

In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick. In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX.

Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics. Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field. As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch. The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183760":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"dfd5812a-e38b-4583-8e7c-01a478f838b6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"555f9977-303b-4d02-8801-1985b2a801c3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"99619957-2ab6-4958-a19e-8e1e76b34598.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Rotox","Overview":"In this 3D Rotoscoped landscape the player controls Rotox the robot, which is required to to eradicate any form of mechanized existence on each of the levels.

As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each. This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary. The professor has a limited amount of mini time machines in his pocket which can be placed on a screen for travelling purposes. However, the usage of them is not limited. The action elements of the game consist of enemies which try to hurt the professor. Those can be disposed of by firing an (automatically recharging) electrical discharge. While those action elements are always present, the focus lies on the puzzle solving.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"183787":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"magnetic Scrolls","Images":[{"FileName":"392f8d98-ff28-48d7-9915-b86c32d2a830.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"d635240c-12a3-4b2f-8500-4be2fb5f0261.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29f5e541-505d-416b-81ba-5863e6d6c9a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"The Pawn","Overview":"The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics is to escape from the land of Kerovnia, where strange occurrences are routine.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished. Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty. Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".","ReleaseType":"Released"},"184010":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a5436b6b-b8a1-494e-accb-579d6b1a8e26.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"69a56947-5899-424a-a72a-692fb8de4337.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f214009f-9b67-4b42-b4b1-2d141b0ad82d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Manchester United Europe","Overview":"First in Krisalis' trio of soccer games based on the exploits of Manchester United, Manchester United Europe is a fun action soccer game that lets you lead this popular club in major European tournaments, including the European Cup, European Cup Winners Cup, UEFA Cup, European Super Cup, and even the World Club Championship -- a more obscure tournament held each year in Japan.

It is a horizontally scrolling game taking place over eight levels, which involves navigating around a landscape and shooting at sprites. However, the aim of the game is to collect droplets of coloured paint to colour the level. Each level starts off as monochromatic, drawn in three shades of grey, and needs three colours (red, blue, and green) to be collected to complete it. The player, a wizard who has taken the form of a green ball, can navigate between the levels through portals. At first the wizard only has access to the first three levels, but completing levels gains access to further levels. Each level has bouncing spheres of a different colours, and shooting them releases droplets, which may be collected. At the same time, each level needs a different colour to be added, which can be composed by collecting sufficient quantities of the correct colours. On later levels, the spheres of paint start shooting bullets, further adding to the challenge. The wizard himself is not capable of collecting paint droplets, and is initially capable of very limited movement, bouncing up and down at a fixed rate, with the player only controlling a speed of rotation, and thus how fast it will move horizontally after next touching the ground. Collecting green pearls (which appear when some sprites have been shot) gives the player tokens which can be used to \"buy\" enhancements, such as greater control over movement and improved firepower, and also a companion known as Catellite. Catellite (ostensibly the wizard's cat) is also spherical in form. It normally follows the wizard, but it can also be moved independently by holding down the fire button whilst moving the joystick (which also renders the wizard uncontrollable). Only Catellite is capable of collecting paint droplets; the player has to use it to do so. In the two-player mode, Catellite is controlled by the second player. As well as droplets of colours, sometimes droplets of other colours also appear, having various effects. These include: Light blue - causes a \"filth raid\", where a wave of fast-moving enemies appear, shooting bullets at the player. Grey - changes Catellite into an \"Indestructacat\", making it invulnerable to enemies. White - gives an extra life. Purple - changes Catellite into a \"mutant cat\", causing it to disobey the player's controls. Black - causes \"freaky bits\", turning most of the scenery black.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"184025":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"338ee0af-a281-4499-b1c2-148058c01c14.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"3f2d7616-61f2-450f-95c9-95bce4b54514.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"74733257-712a-4ea7-b96f-399ac1aee04e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Willow","Overview":"Based on the movie.

Looking like insects and believed to be related to the insect life forms known to humans, the Sirians have shown no mercy: a third of the human population was annihilated. This assault led to the dissolution of all political borders on the Earth. The humans have united to defend themselves against the common enemy. An organisation called the Fist of Earth was formed to defend the planet, and its most important military base, the SolBase, built in orbit. The Fist of Earth sends a fighter pilot navigating the FOE-57 spacecraft on a series of missions to stop the Sirians and protect humanity. Warhead is a mission-based space combat simulation. Objectives include destroying enemies, protecting friendly forces, as well as search and.rescue missions. The player proceeds to the next mission after having completed the preceding one. The space ship is navigated with the mouse; the keyboard controls offer autopilot modes, multiple weapons including mines and stinger missiles, an HUD display, multiple viewpoints, targeting and navigation, all of which must be used during combat.","Publisher":"Activision","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"184028":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"d44038d2-ac63-4c8d-9f3d-0ce94607d3ab.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"efafe4b6-be11-40b0-a378-cdb58532a177.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7a957a26-2a45-423d-8315-327834837d5d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"War in the Gulf","Overview":"A third game in the tank combat series, following from Team Yankee (whose story and setting came from a book) and Pacific Islands (set in an imaginary 1995 war).

Unified by the reign of the benevolent monarch Lord British, the new world was renamed Britannia. Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom. This person is the Avatar. The fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics.

Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia. Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the game play elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moon gates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to four. Additional challenges include navigating characters through the Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar; inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and others. The game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a day\/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping.

To symbolise the unity, the king gave each of his sons a Gem of Tranquility, which when joined conjured a mystical force to protect the land. Some time after the transfer of power took place, an enchantress named Salome sought to take advantage of the princes' fraternal pact. She told them each in confidence that they must break from the others in order to obtain personal wealth and power. The princes took these words to heart and fought for control of the kingdom. When the battle was over, each prince had one of the gems and one quarter of the land. The power of the gems had been broken.

The objective in each mission is usually to take control of key areas, destroy enemy communications, escort support groups, etc. In a nice touch, missions may be undertaken at any time of the day; night missions surprisingly being the easiest, as the enemy has inferior Infrared imaging to your tanks. The graphics could be best described as 'functional', they certainly aren't to the standards of other war sims like Gunship 2000, but the functions are well laid out, simple and extremely easy to use. Overall, Pacific Islands is an improvement over Team Yankee, although interface and dumb AI problems still remain.

Recommended if you like tank sims, but don't expect it to be very realistic.","ReleaseType":"Released"},"184082":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5febd373-b9c9-481f-b618-7f370ca08458.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"edea2480-7340-4f48-b316-965aba7c2e9c.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"11014c0b-c85f-404e-bfa4-12f7bcf693a2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d1c47ea1-51f0-491f-8009-1666c2d922b9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"42f20c8a-e389-4fee-ae23-3fbb82ff26a4.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a5618c2-632c-48dc-a22c-dd1cc8085bac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"eb469e6c-a7db-4308-b49d-ef1c8d0a3d6e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7fd7508c-288c-418f-95b5-59adb5595ef5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Quartz","Overview":"Quartz is a shoot 'em up with a variety of sections.

Once you have collected 9 of each, you can choose a power-up form a range including various weapons, restart points (which effectively gives infinite continues when used with an emulator's 'snapshot' feature) and repairs to the ship.

It somehow fell into the hands of the Blasters, a \"Detroit based cracking group\".

Players can fly both for the German Luftwaffe and the British Royal Air Force. On the British side, two planes are available: the Spitfire and the Hurricane. For the Germans, there is the fighter Bf 109, the heavy fighter\/fighter bomber Bf 110, the infamous Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, and the three light\/medium bombers Do 17, He 111 and Ju 88. Next to training missions for every plane, there are several historical combat missions to be flown. In accordance with history, most RAF missions consist of defense assignments - intercepting and destroying German bombers. Most Luftwaffe missions are attack runs - either flying the bomber escort or the bombers themselves. In the heavier planes, not only can the pilot of the plane be controlled, but also the gunner(s), and, in the bombers, the bombardier. The special Campaign Mode allows one to actually change the historical outcome of the Battle of Britain. On a strategic map, planes must be organized into groups and assigned to missions, one of which must be flown. The outcome of that mission affects those of all others and also the status of the overall campaign. The British side wins by simply surviving for a certain time or by destroying enough German aircraft. The German side wins by destroying enough RAF fighters, either in the air or on the ground. Also included in the game is a mission builder for designing custom missions, and a film playback option for reviewing recorded flight footage.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Their_Finest_Hour_(video_game)"},"184115":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"adf18702-520e-45da-9ee4-a8601461da90.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"50df92c1-7038-4743-b0a6-a70bee82a673.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"aa9a00ac-b832-45d5-8351-e53f33dd317e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Time Scanner","Overview":"Time Scanner is a pinball game.

The music and sound effects for the game were created by Ray Norrish. The main character of the game later made cameos in Leander and Wiz 'n' Liz. This game is a mixture between platformer and shoot'em up. It looks very similar to the popular computer video game Turrican.

At the beginning of each level you may display a map by pressing the Help key (Amiga version). You can jump, run, climb walls and use special weapons or items (keys to open certain gates) to master different sections of these levels. After you lose one life you see a replay and be able to continue at any point by pushing the fire button. You can fast-forward the replay by holding the F10 key.

This game is set in one of the dodgiest area known to software - it's an Elite clone. You begin your quest in the round, anonymous bowl of the spaceport where you have a minimal amount of money to recruit a crew and equip your spacecraft. You then set off on an interplanetary flight by dragging a mouse around the solar system. Once you've established an orbit around the planet a revolving planet appears on which you can attempt a landing. You can then get onto your 4x4 range rover\/mining machine and explore the surface. This is one of the best aspects of Starflight, as you zip around in search of bounty. Then, much like Elite, it's time to return to the starport to flog what you found. The systems are detailed with a good balance of interesting and not so interesting planets to explore. Where it loses out is in the space combat which is entirely formularised and really pretty dull.

Special Forces let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out.

Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview.

It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. Tex soon learns of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter. Tex's first adventure takes the player through the seedy West Coast world of 2033, a setting that combines futuristic elements with film noir and \"hardboiled\" detective fiction styles. The game's main adventure portions are icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. Characters are represented by digitized photos. Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting Tex's Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section. The game also contains side-scrolling action sequences where Tex has to eliminate a number of enemies before being able to proceed to the destination.","Publisher":"U.S. Gold","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"184721":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"2673cc0c-84b1-4415-80f4-e91ce521f080.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e8f7d0c7-649f-4fad-908a-8b084aaba740.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3a0d65c1-0f79-495f-baf5-f31c1afcd46f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Metal Masters","Overview":"Metal Masters is a one versus one fighting game with robots. Each robot has two basic attacks: ranged and melee; which one is used depends on how close the opponent is. In each scenario, the player can control the attacks of the robot: when in ranged mode the used weapon system is chosen (each of the four body parts has its own) and during melee combat, the direction of the punches is controlled. Each successful hit gives points which decide the winner if no fighter goes down within the time limit. A knockdown is achieved by emptying the opponent's life bar. Additionally each hit (with a big bonus for winning) gives prize money which in turn is invested in upgrading the robot. The player can buy new parts for the four components (main body, legs and the individual arms) - but an upgraded robot also influences the difficulty of the next enemy. While being inside a fight, the AI can be set to take over the own robot.","Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"184722":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"62ff8423-5278-48c4-8e55-53ea29150586.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fb6b09b6-3ef0-4a78-8268-b3efb015d969.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a315b893-1fd8-4804-a913-0f746d29a166.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Metal Mutant","Overview":"Metal Mutant is an action game, where you control the eponymous machine, sent to the planet Kronox to find and destroy the insane computer AROD 7.

The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga but the game has been ported to many other systems. The original Amiga release cost £35, an unheard of price for a video game in that era, but it did include a T-shirt in the box bearing a print of the box's artwork. Psygnosis had published numerous side scrollers with high quality graphics prior to the release of Shadow of the Beast (most notably Obliterator). Shadow of the Beast, however, was considered revolutionary because its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples. The first game's story is about a man named Aarbron who was kidnapped as a child and corrupted through magic into a monstrous warrior-servant for the evil beast lord Maletoth. The creature's memory of his human life returns when he watches a man being executed, whom he later recognizes as his father. This prompts Aarbron to seek revenge on Maletoth. The box artwork of the game, like many Psygnosis releases of the time, was created by fantasy artist Roger Dean, in a style reminiscent of his Yes album cover artwork.","Publisher":"Psygnosis","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"184731":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"1274efa5-4d54-4b66-af06-589b9f077bb8.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"a3ed9e6e-bbaf-4ea4-84eb-8ef8b3b286ef.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05aa9f00-f938-4925-b8e6-43ed78da530b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Roller Coaster Rumbler","Overview":"Roller Coaster Rumbler is a rail shooter-type video game.

You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"184761":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"cf6fd409-8403-441e-b044-1c35ce869bd6.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"8c542beb-e656-48c2-b1db-73121f5e7f09.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05872a8a-50bb-47dd-99ad-79511912bdb3.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a2e2e937-2e30-49c8-831a-2f776e348396.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Red Storm Rising","Overview":"The Soviet Union, under severe pressure after destruction of one of their biggest oil refineries, must secure a new source of oil, and to do that, they must disable the West... which means they must invade Europe and fight NATO to a standstill...

Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.

However, you have met with betrayal and been captured by brigands, who will spare your life only if you agree to enter the Fortress of the Dragon and return with the Sword of Kadash. The game is a top-down action\/adventure game set within a maze of rooms and corridors. The player can move in any of the four directions (and diagonally), and fire darts. Only three darts can be fired at a time. These will ricochet off some walls, and be absorbed or cause holes to form in others. They are also the primary method for defeating the various monsters that are scattered about. Monsters can also be defeated by coming into contact with you, but you will in turn take damage. The player has a number of stats. These include health (hit-points) and Armour class, which measures the player's defensive ability and is increased by collecting better armor and rings. There is also experience which is increased by defeating monsters, and will cause the player to level up (increasing hit-points) every so often. The experience levels are equally spaced, with the gap depending on the game difficulty that is selected at the start of the game. The player's dart attack effectiveness is based on the weapon they are carrying, which may be dagger, morning-star, axe and sword, each of which may be enchanted up to +3. Many of the rooms will contain items, which can be collected by walking into them. Better armour or weapons will be equipped automatically. Some items are cursed, causing both armour and weapon to be cursed until a non-cursed holy symbol is collected. Healing boxes, keys and scrolls may also be found. Scrolls allow spells to be cast (using the return key) which temporarily cause monsters to flee from you. There are also secret passages, invisible walls, and a few alarms which cause traps to appear.","Publisher":"Penguin Software","ReleaseType":"Released"},"184768":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gray Matter","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"85cde244-2ec8-4cec-ba67-d2603a94ce41.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"ae9e66e6-2c51-474d-bd84-dec78c0303e5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"158704d4-edf1-4ad9-b962-67044ddd859d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"26c7c5c5-6288-4c58-a89e-c4c462f07977.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"67a009ec-0e76-4e49-a471-35e723c2e7f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Techno Cop","Overview":"Techno Cop is set in the near future.

Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place. Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements. The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.","Publisher":"Broderbund","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"184804":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Populous II"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bullfrog","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"d7adc322-a7d2-4494-adfc-c1a3b0a75f2b.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"78cf55ed-2706-49ad-94d6-588ea8feddc6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7d3aa3bf-658d-4a96-a07d-1ddf76945085.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods","Overview":"Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods is a 1991 strategy video game in the Populous series for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS-based computers, developed by Bullfrog Productions.

This game is set in the USA in the city of Las Envegas. Crime is rife and law enforcement just cannot cope so in 2038 a new law, Resolution 101, was passed which allows convicted felons to be released from jail in return for tracking down and eliminating gangland bosses. The player takes the role of one of these 'Search and Destroy' criminals. They are given a Theta 4000 ground skimmer armed with a light machine gun and they play their way through a series of increasingly difficult levels. Each level starts with a meeting with the sheriff who names the new target. After that the player is in their skimmer patrolling the streets shooting things, not mind controlled alterants but the drug runner's henchmen and gangland minions (same sprites different names). The city of Las Envegas is divided into four areas each of which is controlled by a separate drug runner. The during the course of the game's twelve levels the player must defeat each runner three times in order to finally kill them. The runners have minions who will attack the player as they pursue their quest for justice \/ freedom. As these are destroyed they leave behind cash and drugs that can be collected, the drugs must be collected as evidence. As a further complication the drug runner only makes a few runs through the city in each level so the player must collect the evidence and shoot them down before the last run is complete, otherwise the sheriff will be displeased and the player will lose a life. Around the city are three shops where the player can upgrade weapons, and repair shields or their skimmer.","Publisher":"Millennium","ReleaseType":"Released"},"184809":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"1c62888a-dad2-455a-bbfe-8389878589d0.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"45232f02-2976-41c1-9411-5991796f8758.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7e3f6a58-fb7a-40c5-8168-c6d88caa372c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Shoot' em Up Construction Kit","Overview":"Shoot 'em Up Construction Kit is more of a utility than a game.

It takes place in a fantastic version of the Caribbean during the age of piracy. The player assumes the role of Guybrush Threepwood, a young man who dreams of becoming a pirate and explores fictional islands while solving puzzles. The game was conceived in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles led him to make the player character's death impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface. Critics praised The Secret of Monkey Island for its humor, audiovisuals, and gameplay. The game spawned a number of sequels, collectively known as the Monkey Island series. Gilbert, Schafer and Grossman also led the development of the sequel Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. LucasArts released a remake of the original in 2009, which was also well received by the gaming press. The Secret of Monkey Island is a 2D adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist Guybrush Threepwood through the game's world and interacts with the environment by selecting from twelve verb commands (nine in newer versions) such as \"talk to\" for communicating with characters and \"pick up\" for collecting items between commands and the world's objects in order to successfully solve puzzles and thus progress in the game. While conversing with other characters, the player may choose between topics for discussion that are listed in a dialog tree; the game is one of the first to incorporate such a system. The in-game action is frequently interrupted by cutscenes: non-interactive animated sequences that are used to provide information about character personalities and advance the plot. Like other LucasArts adventure games, The Secret of Monkey Island features a design philosophy that makes the player character's death nearly impossible (Guybrush does drown if he stays underwater for more than ten minutes).","Publisher":"Lucasfilm","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"184813":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f0f921d8-6924-4c64-8494-619e7cc07689.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e34623e2-b510-460f-ac54-b0c99f024598.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5820b1b6-dfcd-4c06-9bd0-9fad994f719d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"R.B.I.

The colony planets of New Chicago have been overrun by gangs of Rrampon invaders, and a state-of-the-art space cruiser has been sent in to purge the infestation. It's up to the Star Breaker, and its android pilot, to destroy the enemy's airborne forces and dispatch the interlopers underground. The main section of each level takes place above the surface of one of the lifeless planets, and plays like a Defender-style shoot-'em-up. The Star Breaker can fly in four directions as it tracks down the Rrampon forces on its radar display - from mines and suicide droids to the dreaded Harvester command ships. The docking bays on the surface provide access to the underground bases. Here, control is transferred to the Light Trooper android, which heads down to the tunnels to hunt down the overlords and their Space Clams. The android can either fly through the rooms using its thrusters, or walk on the ground; computer terminals provide status reports, and can resupply the player with ammo, shields, thruster power and bombs. When the base is cleared, a self-destruct code can be activated, giving the player a few seconds to evacuate. The level is completed when every base has been destroyed, and all the command vessels have been shot down from the skies.","Publisher":"Atari Corp.

You can send the armies of these leaders to parts of the country, taking that part of the land for you. Each cell with at least one army in it gives a certain amount of money per round. You can build mines to increase the financial outcome, or you can build a tavern to reduce the cost of hiring additional leaders.\n\nYou also can use magic, blessing or healing your own troops, or throwing a fireball at an army of the enemy. Magic can also be affected by buildings. Also special troops can be acquired, like the Thief, who tries to steal money from the enemy, but starts to work for him if it fails. Or you can garrison militia on a cell which attacks enemy armies moving in. If two armies meet in a cell, a fight on a separate 2D area is shown, allowing to flee or retreat.\n\nThe game can be played against the computer or with two players. You can chose to play for the good or evil forces, which basically changes the cost of certain spells – all features can be accessed from both sides.","Publisher":"Actual Screenshots","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"184994":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Lemmings II: The Tribes"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WJS Design","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ac0dcc7a-2e28-426f-aadf-2b2643217780.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"eb724c80-aa32-4af9-b87d-5451dcce1409.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"abc98334-b57b-458c-b74f-5510b58829ab.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5aecc3ae-1341-465c-9b1c-a53407ea1aeb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1c391df3-649a-4eaa-b6de-27a0023a54fb.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8cfebbba-cbf4-457d-9f76-7b28879a6d17.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lemmings 2: The Tribes","Overview":"The sequel to Lemmings has a plot describing how the Lemmings have split into 12 distinct tribes, each of which has their own landscape and their own cultural identity - they include Egyptian, Circus and Highland. However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces. Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players. The others range from digging methods such as a scooper (diagonally downwards) and club basher (horizontal), building skills such as a planter (takes time to produce the desired raise to the landscape) and a sand pourer, and various methods of movement including a Pole-Vaulter and a Skater (the only Lemmings who can cross ice). Some of these are only subtly different to others, and their exact uses are unclear, but there are 4 Trainer levels where you can select any combination of skills and experiment. Unlike the first game, the player is rewarded for saving as many Lemmings as possible, rather than simply passing or failing. The ultimate aim is to save all 60 Lemmings through all levels, thereby earning a Gold Medal for that tribe - Silver and Bronze are also on offer. The player can also go back over levels in the hope of saving more Lems. Because there are 12 tribes, and the player can switch between them at any point, you have to be stuck 12 times in order to be unable to progress.

Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded \"unbeatable\"(?) pterodactyl.\n\nThe game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.","Publisher":"Atari Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/JCyvfEWUm-4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Joust_(video_game)"},"189783":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciel SA","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"8943e92c-aad4-4ff0-8f67-103fc916386b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"2384d798-c7dd-4b46-96e9-2a7af1ac0dd3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"50566b1b-7925-41ce-8fc0-d5e960ae6517.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"c661bd65-c63c-496b-b430-75759e4548c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"d0f9abfc-851b-4524-8014-b67849687e57.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"907e888d-a00f-4109-b113-3dfe309bf964.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"99c68ae6-ce60-42d8-b221-6b8fa9260d5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Moon Blaster","Overview":"In Moon Blaster you are a pilot of a ground-skimming space jet landed on the surface of moons to eliminate the enemies blasting them off.

Bad news: Terrorists stole a few leftover atomic bombs. Now the player has to use the new Apache attack helicopter in order to destroy the four terrorist hideouts.\n\nApache Flight is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player spends the most time shooting enemies by using the two available weapons: the unlimited standard ammo (released by tapping the fire button) and limited missiles (released by holding the fire button) which are required to hit ground targets, e.g. cannons and tanks. Those missiles are also available in the heat-seeking variety which are automatically used up first. Fuel is limited and is constantly drained every second, but it can be refilled by hovering over fuel depots which are regularly encountered during the levels. However, when shooting them with a missile instead, the depot releases additional missiles to collect. Of course it is also important to dodge enemies and their bullets because every hit causes the loss of a life. When that happens, a new helicopter with reset fuel and missiles appears with a brief invincibility period at the point of death. The game is lost when all lives are gone.","Publisher":"Atlantis Software Limited","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"190812":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Turcan Research","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"02e61a55-d3b6-4061-9db0-79497b051a9a.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"7d743163-28d2-4186-8d31-e6cb02ef4734.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e7c63047-87d6-4043-84c5-be409b369862.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f731f5d-2942-47ab-9aec-4d70ec071c7f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"c3341dfc-0856-45ac-95b5-c0c158e5ae1b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e730f864-2e46-4b5d-bd6f-c9f4678350f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Austerlitz","Overview":"Third entry in a row of historic wargames focusing on the Napoleonic era (the first two were Waterloo and Borodino).

Each player (human or CPU) controls either the vampire hunter Van Helsing or Count Dracula. Van Helsing is summoned to the Bistritz village to kill Dracula and his brides. His goal is to find thirteen tools to kill Dracula, bring them back to Helsing's home and store them in the cupboard. For Dracula, the objective is to create thirteen brides by finding women, biting and leading them back to the crypt, where thirteen coffins are lined up waiting for their recipients.\n\nBoth characters can be killed by certain hazardous environments and non-player characters (NPCs). Some of these dangers may effect only one of the characters (ghouls only attack Van Helsing, while priests and villagers only harm Dracula). Each player starts with three lives. Collected objects and women are displayed at the bottom of the character window, along with the health bar. The game takes place in the church cemetery and the adjacent village.","Publisher":"Gonzo Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"190830":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Alternative Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"3cbb88c7-08a0-4eb4-a62c-6e62bf23d96a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b4bcc9b8-e561-43d8-b199-949181cded38.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"facd53f4-4768-4124-afc9-730ebb2d4691.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9e35e461-a06e-423e-bfa5-02877c018934.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b9727909-341a-427c-9e99-4c82dee7b145.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Bully's Sporting Darts","Overview":"Do you like to play darts?

It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.\n\nVariations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode.","Publisher":"Krisalis Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/WDiCu0O_B1Y"},"191016":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"0872170c-202f-4487-83cc-04c1d710e341.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1f73d715-0ef1-4d8b-84e6-18b9b6437cfd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"551e3e1b-391d-40f0-aeb5-478723ad85b7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0fe2c3d9-f030-4e50-bad4-4bd87b79c901.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9f76246d-ada2-4630-ac89-5e77dcfdc681.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"84f56e47-3290-44af-b36e-80c9c15e85f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Cartoon Capers","Overview":"Cartoon Capers is the perfect combination of bone-crunching combat and side-splitting humor - and it's suitable for all ages.

Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.\n\nBased on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington’s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You’ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist’s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don’t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist’s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.\n\nFor more information on the movie Die Hard 2, see the trivia and links sections.","Publisher":"Grandslam Video Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2hZPhAI1KPI?t=75"},"191065":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Tommy Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"9b766b97-b88d-49d8-8e33-1594704118b6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"33fd49b5-d5a8-45f6-88cc-89405a2438c2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"131c92bd-4bea-42d6-ba61-9336bfd31bbd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e76706bb-580d-49e7-aa24-9e89ab4c3673.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dizzy Wizard","Publisher":"Diamond Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/kwXtVKZ04f0"},"191066":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nightrider Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"875a6df8-2f01-4f28-8491-edcd6222be12.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5bea4660-4163-4a38-be99-afce8c9b1ad1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7641acee-fa80-434d-8fe4-e00fe16d0cbf.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3589d613-7afe-48ef-8e05-5aaaa641aecc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7778adfa-5323-4175-9877-557711d04cce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bdce1d72-db7e-428b-bc5d-6802407ce3a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f325183c-6863-4e82-beab-97c1b7762009.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dugger","Overview":"A Dig Dug clone with a prehistoric theme, which sports updated 16-bit audio visuals.

Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three lands: the land of men (Midgard), the land of giants (Utgard) and the land of the gods (Asgard). You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these lands to collect the god's weapons. Each land has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.\n\nWhen you start your mission you are given three sub-games to complete. How well you complete these games determines Heimdall's stats (strength, agility etc) as well as how many people he can choose from to make up his party. If you don't do well then you won't get the full 30 characters to choose from and some of the better ones will not be available to you.\n\nThe first sub-game is the Axe Throwing Contest. Here you must throw axes at a young barmaid tied to a stock by her pig-tails. The idea is to hit the pig-tails and not her! Unfortunately because Heimdall is a bit drunk, your cursor wobbles all over the place! The second sub-game is Pig Catching (where you must chase and hopefully catch a pig in its pen) and the third is the Long Boat Fight (where you must try and get to the other side of the long boat without being thrown overboard).\n\nOnce you've done this it's time to wander around the isometric landscape solving puzzles and killing baddies (in a similar style to Cadaver) until you eventually find one of the god's missing weapons.","Publisher":"Core Design","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/MSev7z1u-X4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heimdall_(video_game)"},"191190":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dragonware Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ce239ec9-ac47-42f1-bfbd-ee2fa7499c5f.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d4027fde-2208-4370-a22a-9e418b57789b.jpg","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b0f5e7e-dfb6-42d4-939d-45e8576145ca.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"401a838c-2208-4035-8e9f-3c2b5bc1a206.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hellowoon: Das Geheimnis des Zauberstabs","Overview":"In a world called Boran, the evil sorcerer Kronos decides he has to put an end to King Aaron's rule.

Spielburg is surrounded by forests and mountains, where all kinds of weird creatures dwell: ogres, goblins, talking foxes, stupid magicians, and others. Lately, Spielburg has been assaulted by brigands; besides, the witch Baba Yaga is not to be trusted. The town has everything it needs--even a Thieves Guild--except a strong, brave hero who would protect it. So when a wandering adventurer enters the town, he quickly realizes that his skills might be of use.\n\nHero's Quest: So You Want to Be a Hero is a hybrid game that contains Role-Playing and Adventure elements. It is visually very similar to other Quest titles by Sierra (such as for example Space Quest), but the gameplay--besides the usual exploration, conversations with characters, and the solving an occasional puzzle with the help of inventory items--also involves combat and character development. In the beginning of the game, the player chooses a character class for the protagonist--either a Fighter, a Mage, or a Thief. The choice of class will influence not only the combat, but also many other events in the game. Puzzles might have different solutions depending on the class and the amount of ability points in various categories.\n\nThe main character's skills and abilities are raised directly by repeatedly performing appropriate actions, e.g. fighting enemies, practicing, climbing, throwing objects, etc. Many of those activities are necessary to perform in order to successfully complete the game. Combat takes the player to a separate screen (represented by the enemy's picture) and involves timed selection of commands such as Attack, Parry, etc. The interaction with the game-world is performed by typing verb commands or conversation topics.\n\nThe game features a day\/night cycle, which also includes character schedules. The main character can get hungry and tired, so feeding him and getting some rest is essential.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nttytMgh_9Q?t=118","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quest_for_Glory:_So_You_Want_to_Be_a_Hero"},"191193":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infocom, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"dae84ce6-9962-4250-84b8-92d79b33a6bf.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b7deca4b-db39-4162-ab7c-9bcd180d2e34.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"67a7143f-67a2-4166-ba14-22b9ecc1f703.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"134dbc8d-f7a4-4e1d-a23e-610a307b8596.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fe329b44-db79-4a0b-a97c-e38aceb9a87f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hollywood Hijinx","Overview":"Buddy Burbank was a B-movie actor who one day met the wealthy Hildegarde Montague and married her.

Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns.

The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her.\n\nKing's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/isl8SeB0h4A","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Quest_II"},"191238":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"42bdd4f4-efb5-4c1b-8054-a5232d251a52.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b7732dd9-d610-4297-8b24-90c212d57f17.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f86bfdae-767c-403e-b39c-3e8aa64be5a5.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8fcba087-c0e5-4f5f-92c5-6bfb56bca8e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0b3588b9-881e-4072-95a6-c2aced24efb8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"caffc2a1-b12b-4a34-9a1c-13c6e9799c1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"King's Quest III: To Heir is Human","Overview":"King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.\n\nMeanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.\n\nKing's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands.

Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas.\n\nThere are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level.

Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte.\n\nKing's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well.\n\nGameplay-wise, the game is similar to the first two installments of the series, with a large interconnected world open for exploration and no time limit imposed. The game is the first in the series to have a day and night cycle; certain actions can be performed only during a specific time.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aRsILnKEpgM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/King%27s_Quest_IV"},"191241":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fissionchip Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8ecd71b4-7817-47fc-a93d-e1bc3f39385b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"71019e91-0181-42b1-a6e2-2dbee3347d8c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a9bdcd2-159e-4fa7-a5c1-9322fa4ed147.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"53ad71a0-df0a-4567-be33-1f3fb83cf922.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"fc25d7a8-cbab-4db2-b36c-15d9c5dae94e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9f389cb9-c7d7-4722-8705-f9833b98f7b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"04fe0bb4-6d74-4787-afe7-64af053a062a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Kristal","Overview":"The Kristal of Konos is a magical artefact described as the key to world peace.

Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!\n\nThe premise, the map with the \"stages\", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when \"boss\" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.","Publisher":"Loriciel SA","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/mCzWtjjHWZc"},"191403":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciel SA","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"9b143651-fae7-462e-96fa-2d70de1e9d09.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a438602e-43c0-4f63-a6b8-a08ea3b1acdd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c2df377c-99b9-4903-a10e-d9df0cf934fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"7e8ff7e6-2373-4ebc-91e0-c9ebd750bd43.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b64113ab-86bc-4d05-9567-2b9bc68d520e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bumpy's Arcade Fantasy","Overview":"Mixture of action and puzzle elements.

Each route has its dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed.

The virus has, however, leaked into some of the rooms - some are more poisonous than others - and through the Captain has been injected with a protective serum, if a quadrant is too toxic it will kill him. The serum that keeps him alive is only temporarily effective but the ingredients to make more can be produced in the Converter quadrant. The Converter is activated by touching certain wall panels and placing sufficient quantities of Ying and Yang (the ingredients) in receiver plates. Ying and Yang can be obtained by blasting a doom pod found in one of the quadrants. You carry a nearly indestructible shield to deflect projectiles and nearly all energy beams. In some rooms, however, rotators are active and send out lethal beams. On destruction these rotators release a codeword which can be helpful in accessing later areas of the Doom Tube.

He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game.\n\nThe game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion. The game contains adult situations and semi-implicit depictions of sex.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/3Io5l0YgNko","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Leisure_Suit_Larry_in_the_Land_of_the_Lounge_Lizards"},"191468":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Lemmings 2: Oh no, More Lemmings"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"DMA Design","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"887ec204-e8ce-4564-ae04-bc6ef403c72a.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"771231f2-792b-416c-87d7-3ad61808d31c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a38fc4a7-22ea-46be-8b52-8c8aca9906d1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e2fed3c-0a2f-4e30-94a6-e860e42453ce.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"30a951a7-cd08-44c1-99f8-06c44b2c2b37.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"71526b5a-aed2-4300-9b35-890d64ce10fd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d397a5ad-aa1d-4754-83eb-42ad1b58c895.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Oh No!

Brown monk robes are the only garments allowed, speaking is a capital offense, and every human has been implanted with a tracking chip recording their every move. To track down criminals, the Orbs enlist \"Manhunters\" - humans given access to advanced technology and selected to be a combination of police officers and bounty hunters. The player controls one such Manhunter as he unravels a conspiracy inside the decaying heart of the New York ruins, and a mysterious serial killer on the loose.\n\nEach chapter begins with the Orbs assigning the player's nameless Manhunter with a crime (such as murder) or target to investigate. The player gains leads through the use of the \"MAD\" computer, which displays the logs of all civilian movement in an area in an overhead map view.

After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...\n\nUsing Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ASC8_Xx348s","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Police_Quest_II:_The_Vengeance"},"191574":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"American Ice Hockey","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"DesignStar Consultants, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"a8c1e68b-0bcf-4085-a391-dd0ca307e793.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d3dc818d-e19a-4c03-acab-656e7c7a8118.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"82323f52-db4f-4bbf-8afe-32d8a03277e0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5c47e312-1260-4aa7-aaeb-ecaa44389516.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"82f0df78-7dbe-4c4d-b9c8-3b5f36a31997.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"10a4d2ba-f5c1-437f-8d56-b807fed5c375.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7678fe28-3dac-4784-b6cb-c5e4a7e130ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"d52fa333-76fa-4563-918c-de2aeefdceb4.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bbc3d40e-3c41-45fe-b4ab-b07d18d17211.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"877c86bc-3c48-4f94-a2e4-6f43c47b7479.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Superstar Ice Hockey","Overview":"In Superstar Ice Hockey you control one of 20 NHL teams.

It is worth mentioning that the game uses more than 25 keyboard keys for controls: we can arrest suspects, search them, check our position on the map, take a car ride, or a police car ride, or a subway ride etc. The main goal is to collect enough kickbacks to be able to realize the dream of the policeman in the movie - to retire and buy a PMU-bar near the horse racing place (and that's a lot of money, 2 millions of 'new' francs). Besides, we still have to do our police job as well, visiting the Police Commissioner each morning and following his orders, arresting the criminals etc.","Publisher":"Cobra Soft","ReleaseDate":"1987-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/6elZ4Wa2zlo?t=17"},"191577":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Images Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"cfef42dd-029e-4781-b752-8e47c3b3cecf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"8ce1ed7d-cb34-4d62-8bed-192557270e18.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b6894242-6294-4d96-a364-fc7cb9f869ba.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc2349bd-0f39-4058-b465-38cac41682c7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eca0ca3f-38de-445f-9814-fffb80f43b25.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"59e838cc-6c3b-48f1-9e87-2ca9490bea16.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2c64a792-115c-407c-b09d-30cb95b24c41.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Space Gun","Overview":"2039 A.D.

Each turn, the player can freely move their forces between their provinces or attack neighbouring provinces (though each tank, plane and ship can be moved only once per turn.) A ship automatically takes a number of tanks and airplanes when it is moved. When the player attacks a province, whether a neutral one or controlled by another player, the progress of the battle is shown. Of course, if the attacker emerges victorious by destroying the opposing army, they take over the country. If there's no army in that country, it can be taken over without combat at all.","Publisher":"Starbyte Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/MtHIFFUqOlk"},"191730":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Byron Preiss Video Productions, Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9a0a967a-64c5-4951-93d3-e39247f4d32d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"9e291b4d-2ab5-45e4-adf9-7819752b089d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ebe63348-919a-4f92-8822-21c90bf9fe9e.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"a8017891-76be-406e-b973-1121c85ebf71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fd7de563-209f-4f83-8ec2-a97d1cf4e213.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"51f4da68-50a6-4fc5-b01b-08354f1557bf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Treasure Island","Overview":"Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on \"Admiral Benbow\", his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.\n\nTreasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.","Publisher":"Windham Classics","ReleaseDate":"1986-01-20T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"191731":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"940cee09-6c7c-4dc7-8f86-2b3b809721b2.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"cd5f7336-6afd-4050-a4a1-481a2b09fd7a.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea23f6cc-0ac0-4b38-aaa9-38affdd0b764.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Trex Warrior: 22nd Century Gladiator","Overview":"In the 22nd Century, Gladiator battles are highly important.

Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.\n\nNow, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll find a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.\n\nThe main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jump from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/iBm5DK9pOoc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pushover_(video_game)"},"192064":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Falcon: The Mission Disks: Vol. 1","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Rowan Software Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"cd4772b2-23bf-43ff-bdbf-b9109c3b96eb.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"56d940b8-2c02-46ab-9f53-14dc7019c4ac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e685bfda-84d0-4e11-98a4-595ca9ae9931.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b5c6185b-f5e8-4319-8184-899f47f4d11e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"99ba034d-b3d9-4f7e-8857-a4b967e8d9c4.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9de01e6f-9762-48ab-951a-5bf523c3f491.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"9486e774-7198-4d3f-80f9-2f50b59fa33a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d45762ef-9f81-4629-b839-496e3ed60b5e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f82154de-6d11-41bc-bf6a-cd00ce40ae7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"216e9833-e894-49fc-95a9-3b8f87dd3802.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Falcon Mission Disk: Operation: Counterstrike","Overview":"Objective: Total defeat of the enemy forces by destroying all the enemy industrial and ground assets.\n\nFirst came the original FALCON F-16 Fighter Simulation, with all its superb flight characteristics, full weapons complement, and impressive 3-D graphics displays.

The player must take into account the equipment of a tank and its attributes in order to design a vehicle that would prove successful in combat.","Publisher":"Origin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"192698":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"aeb4ebe3-af2d-40a1-b26a-afb8355ff537.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"5dffd08f-d7d7-4a9c-9833-744fc05fd8cc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d211f225-6c45-4bf2-9959-0e00bcebe607.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Operation: Cleanstreets"},"192711":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"4da13a8b-3fa3-40e8-ac82-2d31a044fa6d.png","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"0201649e-9955-46e7-b53f-5c1a19fc7051.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4ad00c6d-8e71-402c-a81f-e1058cb6d5dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Rockford: The Arcade Game","Overview":"This release combines two of Mastertronic's games: Rockford: The Arcade Game and Back to Reality This is a rocks'n'diamonds style game.

With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together. Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos.

The road is marked by rocks on its sides on most stages, and the player should keep his car on the road. If the player misses a road, he has a limited amount of time to find it again, otherwise he will be penalized. On the second and fourth stages there is no road from the start, and the player must reach the finish on his own. The off-road environment is full of rocks, animal corpses, and other debris. The player should not damage the car too much, otherwise he will be penalized as well. When a checkpoint is reached, a thematic animation sequence is shown for relaxation purposes.\n\nThere are three difficulty levels to select from before the start of rally.","Publisher":"Tomahawk","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"193425":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"RoadBlasters"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Probe","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"3c2c095c-a1ef-4408-8032-0d88080237c4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e0d8984a-784c-4790-8910-6d87a93674e3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a61e4a3e-8ae7-40f5-a9a3-c5b101dd28a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"34fc16e5-a6c8-46ef-aeb0-b9ffe402153d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"32806733-44be-43c5-8c3f-66f202379034.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0c3755ae-fe21-4c59-aaaa-54cdb1257446.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"301c4f83-c0f8-49b8-8d97-a2e919a58a37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Road Blasters","Overview":"Road Blasters is a futuristic racing action game.

Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a \"T\". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.\n\nFinishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point.

The player mans the advanced attack chopper Dyter-07 to drive them back and rescue scientists on the way. The game has eight levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. For each of the four tropical islands, the surface has to be cleared at first by flying around in a side-scrolling perspective, reminiscent of Choplifter. Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed.\n\nThe basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank. When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank.\n\nAfter all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter. Gameplay in these sections is traditional, save for the fact that the player travels downwards from the upper part of the screen: dodging enemy bullets and shooting as many aliens as possible until the level end boss is reached and defeated. An upgraded chopper is important to survive these levels.","Publisher":"Erbe Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/wc9oIFcK_-4"},"193635":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Splinter Vision Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"dbf81604-6e5e-4eaa-9632-985ff917fb2d.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e4841554-e981-4f02-aa7b-3042680794fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"0d2e6245-aa36-46c4-87a2-d7bfaee98fc6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"80999d5b-fac1-41f3-bf1a-ee6901d05b52.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"20ea32a9-f7d2-47b9-bf57-9f95a8eb16db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"14ffa72a-e397-45ca-b718-db0586c1ab0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Eco Phantoms","Overview":"After six years away from Earth, your delivery contract is finally over, you've been paid a fat cheque and you can't wait to get home.

The screen display depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.\n\nThis is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.\n\nElectrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.\n\nBetter still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.","Publisher":"Virgin Mastertronic Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/aFlY2DBPG-o?t=34","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extase"},"193643":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Golden Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"a28d9832-7c2a-4854-bed3-400ff7d277b2.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d38b913c-424c-4aee-b98e-4d557df649d6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ba7ee763-2993-466f-bab9-e097387c2c60.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5d03ff92-dcb2-4ef6-bec0-abab48abe604.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"40bfe264-9abf-401f-8495-0f7a95b579c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Extensor","Overview":"Extensor is a light cycle game played from a first person perspective.

To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.","Publisher":"Audiogenic Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/r0MQm2fkFpU"},"193645":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"55a915ca-6206-45c0-9d61-cf5466b849dd.jpg","Region":"Italy","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"89de541d-1722-43f7-9e54-34ffa8ae903b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"572b86c4-46e5-42ac-86b3-478313717efa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"adcd6124-9821-46be-980c-075a8af72ece.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"F1 Manager","Publisher":"Simulmondo","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/W39vvWHRCxU?t=30"},"193646":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"reLINE Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"d8d68544-8298-4e59-90c3-850d3255dec1.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"dd88a9a8-3f63-474a-8494-8c23d5641282.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"93916345-9e72-4ec8-b1b7-fcc63973ff70.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b03e7be4-a7c5-46b0-919e-539c1f3cf939.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"dd615f80-9b1a-4d0b-b1b7-4942456b9b36.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"efa1b1fa-e114-4565-8015-7d729308ee9f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cdad1e6e-d449-4fbd-9848-2f0e360c54b7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fate: Gates of Dawn","Overview":"Winwood was just an ordinary man, an owner of a small record shop - certainly not a very suitable profession for someone who would become a hero in a magical land. But fate had its own plans for our hero. One day, feeling particularly drowsy, Winwood closed his shop and fell asleep on the sofa. Soon his dream turned into a nightmare: he realized he was trapped in his own dream world, a fantasy land with mages and ferocious monsters, unable to wake up. An old man named Naristos explained to him that a mysterious mage known as Thardan has been terrorizing the land for a long time. Thardan's power might be the only solution to Winwood's predicament. As a traveler between the worlds, Winwood alone stands the chance of getting close to Thardan, and perhaps ridding the magical land of his tyranny.\n\nFate: Gates of Dawn is a first-person role-playing game with turn-based combat, similar in visual style and gameplay to Wizardry and Bard's Tale games. The player can recruit up to 28 characters, resulting in four parties that can be controlled separately. A notable feature of the game is a day\/night cycle with weather effects that influence the behavior of the world's inhabitants. For example, less creatures will venture outside if it is raining; the player can choose to cast the Rain spell to reduce the number of hostile encounters.\n\nThere is a total of 32 different character classes in the game; many of them are traditional (like Wizard or Cleric), but there are also many exotic ones, such as for example Nymph, Banshee, Valkyrie, and others. Each class has abilities and spells associated with it. The world of the game is inhabited by eleven races, each with its own background history.","Publisher":"Reline Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/13yFBYwcg5g","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fate:_Gates_of_Dawn"},"193647":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Panther Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"d74aa109-d6d7-4b24-b232-44e76015bbaa.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"5f3b0f70-7648-4dd8-8abe-18fa2180cf8f.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c618a853-045d-4f25-bfc3-f2925a2ff322.jpg","Region":"Australia","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b07001e9-7b21-420d-a8ca-504f46e9b9d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f26027ac-32b5-46d8-a7c0-74249a3e8d0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6d999b17-0b9a-4b0d-b7a5-4ff1d079147c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fire-Brigade: The Battle for Kiev: 1943","Overview":"The Fire Brigade was the 48th Panzer Korps, which was heavily involved in the battle this wargame recreates - Operation Barbarossa, Germany's attempted offensive in Russia during World War 2.

The mini games are divided into three basic categories: gym (button mashing), ball juggling (using moves with the right timing) and field event. The latter is also split into three succeeding disciplines: dribbling around obstacles, penalty and kicking the ball through hung up tyres.\n\nIt is important to monitor the athlete's pulse rate and energy level which can be refreshed by either taking a rest or drinking. The game automatically does it for the player if the stats get too low, but it takes more time then. The game features three difficulty levels which can be assigned separately for each participant.","Publisher":"Gremlin Graphics Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0-9fShfCKMA"},"193671":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Dynamix","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"b6e8131d-147b-4a56-b048-25ebdf78f629.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e9100ca1-949d-4060-9cd8-b17269e8b035.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e10752cc-de3b-443b-8b15-8e52eb88e1a0.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"efe52234-2d6d-4083-bf19-609c071c4ab0.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5ef135b8-8d2b-4984-b030-06bc6364aea2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a4381b2e-fd4f-4228-939f-981d7e460a82.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"GBA Championship Basketball: Two-on-Two","Overview":"GBA Championship Basketball can be played as One or Two Player vs. the Computer or Two Player with Computer Teammates and includes Practice Play.

He hands you a map and in his dying breath, tells of a great treasure of gold located in one of four castles built by the Four Princes of the Realm. Although deserted for many years now, the gold still remains, along with only a few evil things and remnants of sorcery that watch over the treasure.\n\nYou remember a tale your grandfather has told of a disguised evil magician who had won the favor of the Four Princes and would serve as the Court Magician. They would later trust him to hide away the Realms riches within the Gray Castle, protected by his magic. But, once the gold was in his grasp, the magician rose up against the Princes, casting them out of the castles with powerful spells of magic. Legend also says demons rose up to destroy any that remained in the land, especially each of the Princes of the Realm. Very few survived to tell the tale. With only your work horse as company you leave on your quest. At the start of this game of exploration, you have a choice of difficulty, Easy, Medium, and Hard. The Easy level has one castle to explore with 79 different screens. The Medium level has two castles, and 159 different screens. The Hard level has four castles and 320 different screens. Each increased level of difficulty has more foes and obstacles to overcome, and more items to find. In addition, the Hard selection will randomize certain items and conditions giving 4096 possible games, which effectively makes Gold of the Realm always different whenever you start a new game.","Publisher":"Magnetic Images","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/d8mCF_8nhhI?t=15"},"193676":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Zeppelin Games","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"8d0ee2f3-1d69-4367-980e-7f33185e0527.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"135ff027-041d-474a-9a0f-0df5fdbf19c4.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"65a47a2f-3f12-4447-916b-9650837b9c77.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"851e61a7-059a-496a-943f-d39a40fc2318.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"c5697fcc-9a1a-4ac0-998c-ac46ee5ea5e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d1a7514d-72b8-43e6-87dd-739fa65c678e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"106189e8-194b-483c-bcb0-b2c40cc1d340.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Graeme Souness Soccer Manager","Overview":"Graeme Souness Soccer Manager is a basic football managing game based on the English leagues where the player is responsible for bringing a team (any available) from the Conference to the top division.\n\nOptions are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions.

The player is a construction worker, one of the best at constructing skyscrapers out of pre-formed steel structures, who has now been called for a really tricky job. This building site has been infested with gremlins who make the job that much harder than it already is. The task at hand is simply to construct the buildings while not getting killed by the gremlins. To make it even trickier the contractor has set a time limit that has to be beaten.\n\nThe building site is viewed from a side perspective and the player can move the construction worker left and right. From above building material is sent down with a crane. To build a new floor the player first has to pick up and position vertical girders and then consecutive floor segments that are placed on top of these. Once a girder is in place the player can climb it to move between the floors. A floor is considered complete when it consists of five floor segments supported by at least two girders. In the first level one floor has to be completed and the number increases with one for every new level. In addition to the building material the crane will also deliver food and drink. When picked up the player's score and energy level increases.\n\nVarious creatures roam the construction site trying to make the job harder for the player. Most common are the gremlins that drop from above and move across the floors. They can eat objects and floor segments and will stun the player if they hit him in the head. Gremlins also drop eggs that mothers hatch out of. The mothers are lethal to touch but can be killed by throwing spanners at them. Mothers can give birth to crawlers that are as dangerous as their mothers. Another creature is the spitter which grows out of girders and spits acid globules at the player. Other dangers include falling bricks and banana skins that the player can skid on.","Publisher":"Screen 7","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/AJ6rj_oDgrs"},"193687":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"969b8a41-f27f-4c59-84ae-86a9a5673203.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"09d56a59-bcc4-4c60-8d6e-b9b9a2e6e4d8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a7a94cc7-b261-4c38-b804-8725476ec385.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"1bf1b6ca-c237-474b-86ec-0db3c1e1ce1b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e50dd5fb-9a99-407a-8b84-11847fcd7f88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hollywood Hustler","Publisher":"Desert Star Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994},"193688":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"reLINE Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"d6bdee83-1844-428c-940c-c9cda954278c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5124c9db-676f-4138-8e5e-6119a121ba24.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"026346f1-1f8f-4928-8a27-da846ea06cbe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"82ccbffc-1161-4e53-890a-2e4e1ec16a67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"23e14c0b-70b5-4d2d-9338-ed3dc27ff9e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hollywood Poker Pro","Overview":"Hollywood Poker Pro is a strip poker game and the successor of Hollywood Poker.

Babies can be either returned to the ground for points or kept in Helen's grasp to convert them into power-ups eventually.

The player takes the role of a group of three special agents which have to save her within a time limit. The player has to choose between nine soldiers which are divided into three categories: leader (shooting), demolition (grenades) and communication (opening locks and picking up items). The soldiers within the same category also have different advantages and weaknesses. Also chosen before starting the mission is the difficulty level and hit points of the team members.\n\nDuring the game itself, one member is controlled by the player and the others by the AI. However, to perform special actions it is possible to instantly switch between them. This is needed because there are a lot of options how to proceed in the maze-like embassy, e.g. players may choose to open a lock or shoot it open. While a large portion of the game is dedicated to finding the way and searching for clues which hint to the daughter's location, there are also strong action elements: When meeting enemies and controlling the leader, the cursor has to be quickly moved over the opponents to shoot them before they can damage the team. Resources like ammo are limited.","Publisher":"Microvalue","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"193702":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"FIL","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"c82272cb-0864-4b47-91ff-ebf1b53ab87d.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"45ac2ede-b39c-4c41-ab67-9355ef9ec005.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"30da9197-ad77-45d3-a448-a6421d1dd944.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"22540754-235c-4d51-aaf7-b415500b26de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Missions en Rafale","Publisher":"FIL","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/uANceKByJnQ"},"193703":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"5ad5ba79-781a-46ff-9c02-bfdeb45bd90a.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ef039138-339f-4e86-8268-dca49bf0bbd6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ef23462-5f13-48b6-8b76-8a1e124428c3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Missing:...

The graphic comes with occasionally zooming sprites beside the bitmap road, with the background picture scrolling left and right. There are no AI drivers, so playing the game alone you can only race against the high score.\n\nUp to four players can race against the time in a hot-seat mode on the created or loaded tracks. You car have four gears, switching up and down easily with the joystick. The score is always starting at 9999 and counting downwards with time and you also receive a penalty on the score for crashes.","Publisher":"Prism Leisure","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"193724":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Super Ski","Region":"Europe"},{"AlternateName":"Eddie Edwards Super Ski","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"AlternateName":"Superski Challenge","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microïds","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"c684ad04-c8db-45fa-92fb-3a197eca9a80.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"91fe04be-cebc-4c04-82c3-37436e960af6.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ee1c3bab-16af-4b69-a59b-b92fee0a42cc.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"24ce3114-cedf-4621-ba36-75fe33cc6703.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"26d48baa-7540-4c36-b3a6-ad6cab267ce0.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7741a408-f0a2-44a8-965c-63ae4011c479.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7bbfb95d-7711-458e-b1b6-a081d146e49b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"70bc061a-14e1-4951-98d7-7ad88b2fc999.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7e7ea0e4-d37a-4bd5-8dae-226501434028.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"2eb0454a-4f1d-47df-868e-20409c7db55f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"bce0605b-faa7-453a-b1de-7c3f35ac90ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":5,"Name":"Downhill Challenge","Overview":"This skiing game is viewed from behind the player in 3D.

It was the time of the Roman Empire splendor, their legions extend and dominate the known world, but in each one of their provinces the inhabitants breathe freedom and make their own rules, codes and rituals. In Hispania, Jabato became a legendary figure, prototype of the implacable hero in the fight against the evil but with a great heart.

Your final mission will be to avoid that her could be sacrificed by the fanatical sect of the Egyptian sub-world. For it, on the first part, you must liberate yourself from the Roman yoke and search for company. Multiple adventures are awaiting you soon in the Galia and Hispania. The second part begins in Cesarea, in which you must enter in the heart of Africa and obtain the keys that could allow you to survive in the lands of the mythical tombs, sacred Pharaohs and great mysteries. If you survive, you will fight the final battle against the terrible forces of the dark wisdom.","Publisher":"Aventuras AD","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ytZXphVPmpk"},"193730":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"System Applied Technology","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"14804f9f-41c1-4329-8ece-b336163787c2.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"894e60bc-85d2-428d-934c-8a1fb86a428e.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"420e9f1f-a081-406c-bd1b-f9519740f993.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"f99beb0b-42c7-4e32-aec8-9049c0c74de4.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"ffcd4070-407b-4687-a440-eb91c76d4df5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5d413ee9-778f-4bec-b888-d7d00c3afd07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":4,"Name":"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf","Overview":"Jack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf is a 3D golf simulation featuring an 18 Hole course created by Jack Nicklaus himself.

The only antidote functions like a drug and big corporations exploit this situation. They are free to act without any supervision and this results in armed war between them. The hero Jonah Hayes, small-time smuggler, has no part in this until he gets force-employed by one of those corporations to bring a living freight, a product of genetic engineering, to Earth.\n\nSuspicious Cargo is a text adventure with a graphical user interface. It is not necessary to type in commands into the text field; the commands can be constructed by clicking on the symbols of the user interface. When talking to other people, the topic can be chosen from a list.

In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.\n\nPopeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.\n\nThe second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.\n\nPopeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.","Publisher":"Alternative Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/hDElSB0p0JM"},"193757":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Artech","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"1910b40b-d56c-484d-996d-5a9c30f536cd.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3a831358-d2fc-4282-b7e1-26f5a41d9316.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6bdc8444-fce7-470b-b4cf-e0834735093d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7b07e12a-04dc-4187-b331-02678152d31a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"53723a70-6950-4ee9-87ea-f1ae970c7d37.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1f29f460-48ad-4e00-8ca2-f7a7fc21a9f3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Powerboat USA: Offshore Superboat Racing","Overview":"Powerboat USA: Offshore Superboat Racing is a racing game in which the player uses a power boat to race against four AI opponents.

The player controls the field athlete and tries to score goals or tackling the enemy when in defense.\n\nAs with many futuristic sports games, a match can be hazardous to the athletes. Not only are rude actions like flying kicks allowed, but the playing field is filled with obstacles like pits or disintegrators. Stepping on those causes the athlete to die and the need to use one of the two substitute athletes. Those have different stats (strength, reaction, shooting and balance) which influence the match - if there are enough alive, the player can choose the used athlete at the start of the match. The scrolling screen keeps on the puck and a radar helps to navigate the obstacles off-screen.","Publisher":"Ubi Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skateball"},"193760":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MC2-Microïds","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"f6a840aa-5902-4e99-a61c-66a85bf3221d.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f5e6b960-58bc-443d-a1fd-638f149d77dc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d82ac500-584f-4960-98da-6aa025b4721f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f54292ce-0fe4-496a-8945-636f25f45276.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Superbike Challenge","Overview":"Superbike Challenge brings 1000cc motorbikes to life for a one or two player race.

Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.\n\nAny pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.\n\nThree play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style.\n\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\n\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.","Publisher":"Audiogenic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/M02_MCNk-lI","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Loopz"},"193861":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Thalean Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"1ae3236a-c088-437c-a96e-831c1c13375f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d417b763-df14-4f10-adb8-8d27167a4580.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4762914f-95cd-4488-b691-968a6847ceb3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e89e88af-b180-4960-bf0d-20afce1168f7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"0f928b6e-b921-4c4d-9c32-20cf94860b75.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Lords of Conquest","Overview":"Lords of Conquest is influenced by the boardgame Risk.

Finally, Mad Virus tosses you back and forth on a conveyor belt (through cages of hungry mutants) while you try to destroy the gigantic brain that controls it.","Publisher":"Silmarils","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/PqEQOu9hmAo"},"193907":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paradox","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Beat 'em Up","Images":[{"FileName":"1ee037ea-f8ea-494d-9012-a8e158b612f5.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"8952dc23-2011-4aa0-ba9d-17a48569c3bb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7410fed6-6cff-450c-a25e-0841b5f89480.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"853050c7-9c6a-4cd3-92a9-98c1b3c4d767.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b61719d2-9a8e-401a-8b4d-faca0f97f9f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a92f6542-80bb-4da8-a825-05be2c4b0a65.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"55037f47-0c04-4cfe-963c-ddb7771f110e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mafdet and the Book of the Dead","Publisher":"Software Horizons Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"193909":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blue Turtle","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"3ef88910-0e20-4aac-a2a4-dd182a855962.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f14a5728-1ae5-4e7f-b2a5-cd724edc2ecd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bb4a6967-2f3f-4d76-b11a-f6dcecfc5c87.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3cab9a36-0333-4493-b623-9d8d6d29209c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c2f931a8-c18f-425d-83b2-147f43ed588c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Magic Boy","Overview":"Join Magic Boy as he attempts to become a master wizard, and he does this by shooting enemies, putting them in a bag, and throwing them away.

To avoid this, the president comes up with a plan to stop the disaster - but before applying it, the long-term impacts on the world need to be validated. This is done with a simulation visited by the computer project PRISM, designed to be a true AI. The game starts when PRISM awakes from a simulation of his own, human life and is told that he is in fact the world's first sentient machine. At this point, the player takes control over PRISM.\n\nA Mind Forever Voyaging is a text-based interactive fiction game. The player reads descriptions which detail the surroundings and communicates with the game by typing in commands. Most of the time is spent in simulation mode where the player repeatedly visits the town of Rockvil and needs to record situations of everyday or special activities going on. If the player has recorded enough, the game progresses and the simulation ten years ahead can be visited. However, the recording device has no unlimited capacity - when full, the player needs to exit the simulation and let the recordings review by the project leader. Then the current simulation can be simply started again from the start to find new situations - the same applies when dying.\n\nBetween simulations and toward the end there are situations outside the simulation, but overall the game is light on puzzle-solving and more about experiencing how said plan changes Rockvil and its people over time. Outside the simulation there are three more modes to enter: communications (switching to various video\/audio units to examine other locations and people), library (various documents and other information to read) and interlace (communicating and giving orders to the own subsystems).","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Mind_Forever_Voyaging"},"193934":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Synapse Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"97d2d9a0-5c77-4eb5-98e6-e2c062b1d3b9.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"fb05e5d8-6b92-4abf-b841-e24432b93d24.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"50d2cf9b-6b7d-41c3-b215-e82d25d6e5c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eb5a6a43-346c-4515-a17e-6ab0608398c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mindwheel","Overview":"This real time all-text game puts you in the role of a Mind Adventurer, asked to journey back through the minds of four deceased residents of your planet in search of the Wheel of Wisdom.

Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission's end.

Each level has a time limit in which it needs to be completed; run out of time and you lose a life; lose all lives and the game is over.\n\nIn addition to the regular symbols, there are also some special objects on the screen which may help or hinder your progress. These include bombs which destroy several symbols at once, blocks which may get in the way or be arranged to help out, death heads which diminish time more quickly, and flower pots which can't be moved.","Publisher":"Ubi Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ifyUPEZFJC4"},"194030":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Oxford Mobius","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"a447b5c0-9d72-493d-88c8-84694964eddb.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"7c4888ca-d139-4828-8e30-40b0a96d801f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bf375633-888c-4d27-9018-4196f047cacb.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"d9cbe93c-8bf1-442b-9155-79abcf346ded.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"54ed8cd2-c79d-4aec-aedb-15a3d4530deb.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"734ed3ae-84fa-4922-84d7-1fee614abd2f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"dfa68fde-2586-4e52-9494-20ace823e338.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c8f2f4cd-95e0-4124-b3e6-6bcdcc2e529b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5726b18d-27bb-4e02-b25a-cb5dc5525e4c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Pictionary: The Game of Quick Draw","Overview":"Based on the board game, the object is guess a word or phrase based on a drawing.

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.\n\nThere are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with two others, and immediately removing all three. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example).\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of two sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are two sets on level 2, three on level 3, four on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your three lives.","Publisher":"Ocean Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ONQVUhpCR_I","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzznic"},"194050":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Loriciel","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"1deb22be-9576-4334-a2a0-3152f52f638e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f45c10ca-d8e5-480c-9bc6-14794139dab0.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9fbd1cef-b0d7-41a0-bd2e-91d16133850a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"342f3d54-8618-44e8-97f5-d33c0c7bb79d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f432b2da-70de-4eab-8817-3aa731613e23.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"35176aaa-52e6-4d6a-ac9b-2672e6b4d1a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Quadrel","Overview":"Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color.\n\nAt the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not.

Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/9HfgYELrPGE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roadwars"},"194063":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Infomedia","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Music","Images":[{"FileName":"fc638d28-5334-428b-8cc1-bd043f09a254.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"10395a3d-e332-4d99-934c-5859c20f1f0b.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a76b8cb1-a049-4a16-9e0b-a4e9d299a325.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1f4af55a-712e-43fa-8f4e-b4b79e5f8066.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Rock Star","Publisher":"Infomedia","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/SE8caPHlFY0"},"194064":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Codemasters","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"e8183e57-fedb-4812-a9e6-78ef06aa3451.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"408b30f8-631b-4c78-9307-7501db546e62.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"dc4b204f-358a-4ae6-9304-5d18a1559423.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ac61aa5d-75b6-49f2-af7e-16e4d0187b92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"b1fe0a50-762f-4a8b-90e1-003f26b197c7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"795b482a-3b12-4387-ad4b-7a304e388965.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rock Star Ate My Hamster","Overview":"The player takes the role of Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. They must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once the player has chosen their artists then they have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand, or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but the player might pay for their choice later on in the game.\n\nTo make the group a star the player has options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for their stars. Each action choosen advances the calendar by one day. The player has until December to achieve their ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of the band's releases.\n\nOnce the player's band has recorded their first album the player can choose to release the single and\/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director is chosen to direct it. The player can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of the rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend the gigs. The player loses the game if either they run out of money or all of their rock stars die.","Publisher":"Codemaster","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/MKRO8XpTqdM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rock_Star_Ate_My_Hamster"},"194065":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lankhor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"d33243f4-1301-418f-ac5b-96dae95fa637.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ed7f31ca-b1d5-45fa-a626-4967889374f8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7b2082ad-b66b-41cb-8314-44a8e251f6fe.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c1c0e327-4e46-44d3-915f-c2bc4b75a609.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d2234568-5bd7-4f7e-bb65-b1ff6ad114d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"63302473-7bac-4a36-ab8f-707ad2514283.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rody & Mastico","Publisher":"Lankhor","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fPuEDOWZ3zg","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rody_%26_Mastico"},"194066":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lankhor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"c9b33d2d-d032-41bf-91bb-baf46050c858.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"5961c89c-6d12-45aa-8767-15c54204e9ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1acd9ac5-f94a-42f4-bcb4-a14ea0210fd0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"f61b8245-6edc-4c1b-ad44-38feed56c804.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rody & Mastico II","Publisher":"Lankhor","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/OkACahOgw8Y"},"194067":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lankhor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"98cb46fe-a5c3-4e8d-a0ae-e74d52b8221c.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"962f98e3-d2ca-455b-814a-450a81459ab6.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"58f5e8fe-267b-4b33-a95d-a1266289547c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"42fac95b-df74-4303-8f43-7c7eef1e7d1a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d9638c61-1887-43bd-92ce-f18b80de67ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"99ab6dfa-f450-41ae-a9fa-b3dc4518ee11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rody & Mastico III","Publisher":"Lankhor","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/CyppSwcrI54"},"194068":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Rody & Mastico IV: Rody Noël"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lankhor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"ddabfaca-5260-4479-848c-fde5e97383e0.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"51a6474f-31df-405f-98e5-58073da95a1b.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b91867ca-135c-4502-bb92-ac6968182d38.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"f49e1f89-df1e-4e56-a9e7-96e491df8264.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d8e28e3b-fc7c-4b02-bada-463e81a82477.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rody Noël","Publisher":"Lankhor","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZjF-9NhyQp4"},"194069":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Lankhor","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Education","Images":[{"FileName":"0d5e1338-dff6-4148-9433-67a564b40fcc.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3a4cd98d-375b-4e88-8d05-254b7f90aad3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6a6d2e01-fbe0-44bf-9a65-ef8fbe29a5da.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d31acc9a-5e7d-4fec-a566-eab4ac70d6c9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"54e9294e-16a1-4ce6-9eb4-86c450b0b2a2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9a742586-6131-4253-9b33-dcaa6ab5c9d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rody & Mastico VI","Publisher":"Lankhor","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/0RB9WrnHGk0"},"194070":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Krisalis","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"548d8b99-e632-44ac-b976-57222b71aeba.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2a6883fd-8a7d-457f-b8e7-bd41173025ff.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f647f293-af51-4521-b47b-6a98ffd069c6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e25026bf-9e9c-4678-867e-82adf85b4286.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4a9ed065-e569-494e-8e1f-1059744587bb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rogue Trooper","Overview":"Rogue Trooper is a Genetic Infantryman (G.I.) of the future whose entire battalion was wiped out on their first mission in the Quartz Zone of Nu Earth.

When a city is taken, any mobile army that came from that city is automatically disbanded.

The play world is divided into 25 countries and four opponents (optionally all of them can be controlled by humans) want to become the leading force. This is either achieved by gaining control over 15 countries (either by buying them or with force), driving all competition out of the business or getting a certain amount of victory points with economic or belligerent achievements.\n\nGameplay focuses on economical management and can be seen as expanded Kaiser. During each round (which represents three months), the player can adjust the setting screws of the countries, e.g by hiring agents (can be sent on special missions like assassinating an opponent), stock dealing, trading produced goods, setting the tax or starting a war.

The player must also defend the own bases while trying to destroy the enemy ones. The own bases can used to restore the own helicopter's health and the bases' health can be restored by destroying enemy bases.\n\nEach of the three moving unit types exist in two different variations, which are different in their moving speed. Therefore the player always have to keep an close eye on the radar, on which the different types are displayed in different colors (light colors represent the faster types, dark colors the slower moving types). The player's helicopter has two different weapons to fight: missiles and machine guns. While the first is very good to destroy bases, enemy vessels can be easily hit with the machine gun. Control of the own weapons can be extended when playing with two players or using two joysticks at the same time: in this case, one joystick\/player controls the helicopter's movement, while the second controls the weapon direction.\n\nThe game features 20 levels of difficulty, which the player can choose at the start. Although the playfield is displayed with filled polygons, the world itself is basically 2D, as the player can only rotate around one axes; turning up and down or rotating the horizon is not possible.","Publisher":"Reline Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/GfO67XDeDZg"},"194116":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Creation","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"e9f1eab2-bfdb-4c5a-880a-645f25cb65e4.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7dd76908-9b34-475c-a717-67860eccaf96.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8c13090d-e77a-41ce-94e0-b216b067a092.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5af8e03d-48e5-4da2-a2f8-67555e17bf53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e4249000-ce18-4318-b64f-a4b2226177b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Skyrider","Publisher":"Diamond Games","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/7-crb018pzE"},"194117":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Synergy","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"8208f74c-a2e2-43d3-982b-72ea6dac710f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"46c32192-0e72-4000-a7c1-0e052c84ef80.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4f1a5028-e320-43a6-855f-fa224cf98505.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"7c162d3c-fd6b-43f8-8825-c1ae059fd0e4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5fb850d7-4eb2-4a75-b4fc-87ab2a4f4fec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Slackskin & Flint","Overview":"Slackskin & Flint is an arcade, platformer game for the Atari ST developed by Synergy released in 1992 (by Fun Factory)","Publisher":"Fun Factory","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/PaPmajiypnQ"},"194118":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"5cabc069-af91-4281-9bfc-6111435939a5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"569aed4a-cfe5-4398-b71b-ce4b0b56ff76.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ef6cb818-a189-4289-86e9-34ebca2618c7.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"323881d4-724d-4de7-9ce1-fbf452b16859.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"45b1f7a2-bc40-4e4a-a9de-f0965e33e335.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aef78b7f-b8d2-4551-abc7-8b50d3c8d720.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Slaygon","Overview":"In Slaygon the player takes control of an advanced robot and has to infiltrate the facility of Cybordynamics, a corporation that is developing a toxic virus that potentially can kill all humans.

The hero of this story lives in the town of Thurin, which is somewhat out of the Archmage's range of influence. However, when a gravely wounded kobold delivers a message to him and dies on the threshold of his house, the hero realizes that his long journey has begun - the journey to wake up the slumbering god!\n\nSleeping Gods Lie combines elements of action and adventure-style gameplay. The entire game world is viewed from first person perspective, rendered in \"fake\" 3D. The player explores this world, finding items, solving occasional puzzles, and getting closer to the goal. Enemies will often attack the hero; the key to victory is usually the power of the weapon the hero wields. These can be melee weapons as well as long-ranged ones such as a slingshot. Combat is entirely action-oriented. The game has an internal clock, and the hero can get tired and will have to rest from time to time.","Publisher":"Empire Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/jiDlRTkMVWI"},"194120":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Microïds","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"48ff6f97-c4ce-435f-bdfa-63816c2269b3.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"946fdd9f-a8ba-47c0-98a9-21310907166c.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"6635537b-f769-46d0-b3bb-c6c985e9b0b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"98f2ea5e-8ce4-410f-9457-98aba8752aaa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Sliders","Overview":"Sliders is a simple futuristic sports game that isn't a world away from Marble Madness.

All three can be replenished by visiting space stations that are distributed over the spaces (also following a mathematical basis). The space ship is controlled through mouse movements, e.g. pushing the mouse forward accelerates the ship, and the keyboard is only used for commands like pausing the game.

And even worse: you do not know exactly which space station you are looking for and most of the stations are property of the pirates as well. As with the bad situation, from the outside these pirate owned stations are looking exactly the same as the civil stations. What sounds like a design flaw was part of the monetization of the game: the disk with the game was not only without copy protection, but it was allowed to copy it freely and therefore the possibility to spread it through Public Domain libraries.

Each level consists of tiles that make out the spider's web. Problem is that the web is under siege by odd spherical creatures. This has lead to some passageways being broken and now it's up to our little spider to repair the damage done. The aim then is to rebuild these parts of each level so that the spider can move on to the next. This is done with the use of coloured tiles. The HUD shows a flashing dot that indicates what colour is needed. The spider then has to find a tile in that colour and move it to the tile that needs to be repaired. Once this is all done the spider gets access to a teleporter and can move on to the next level. The spider isn't alone however. It has to be careful not to come into contact with the balls that move around the web. Balls can be destroyed by building a web in front of them. They won't be gone for long though since they will respawn after just a few seconds.","Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/fG-UMWcTIbM"},"194131":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"61b1ae23-c45a-45ee-99d0-cfb2ec798785.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"acf38971-6c41-4be5-b7b7-23eaac0eda04.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"4546a384-85ce-4edf-85e7-3a66d94e1368.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5262a3ee-d94f-426a-b6f0-a48eb4bda779.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b3cc9c4e-afb4-4962-809e-ac5914b2ce7b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"58eb25c6-0e37-4a07-b901-32fffa735fb9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spindizzy Worlds","Overview":"On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.\n\nYou have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/imIC6QrvMN4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Spindizzy_Worlds"},"194132":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Synergistic Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"3051e601-3794-4782-b8ef-e000cfd52760.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2f52e908-e137-4e2d-b8e3-3e075664953f.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5d21f6f-9690-4951-9ee9-0af0172dd5b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"e692e805-8c7c-4811-9e4f-f6f1dc825734.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a44226d9-c10e-4fc5-a315-973ec53abcfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Spirit of Excalibur","Overview":"A spiritual descendant of War in Middle Earth, Spirit of Excalibur uses the same engine to tell the tale of what befell Camelot after the death of King Arthur.\n\nYou play the role of the regent who holds the throne while chaos spreads through Britain. The game is broken into a number of episodes, which carry the overall plot of trying to restore Arthur's kingdom to some semblance of what it once was. Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and\/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFay.\n\nThe game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a 'scene' level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted.

The goal of the game is to bring the chosen team from the fourth into the first German soccer league; the game is won when a certain goal (chosen before the game starts) is reached. Besides the German league of the season 1991\/1992 (with 18 instead of the real 20 teams) there are also a few fictional scenarios available, e.g. one in which first and return match are directly behind each other or a world league with national teams.\n\nDuring the game, the player has the usual options to choose from, e.g. lineup, tactics, training camps, transfer market, expanding the stadium or merchandising. The strength of an athlete is calculated from the factors position (how well he can play on the position he has to play), shape (if and how well he played in the past) and energy (physical shape). After each season the manager has to have a certain amount of money on the club's account (how much depends on the chosen difficulty level) in order to avoid being fired. The game also rates the manager's performance which is mostly interesting when multiple players are participating.

It's a football management game, setting you in charge of one of the teams in the top 2 English divisions of the time and giving you control over transfers, tactics and training regimes as you aim to guide your team to success. Initially you can only manage the lower teams, but if you succeed over a few seasons you will become respected enough to have a chance to get the top roles.\n\nThe focus is on ultra-realism, which makes it very hard to quickly transform a club's fortunes, as there is a lack of money at many of the smaller teams and attracting players is harder than in the Premier Manager series and similar. Matches are viewed from top-down highlights, with 3 levels of detail (goals-only, highlights and kick-by-kick) offered.","Publisher":"Black Legend Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tactical_Manager"},"194150":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Mark Heaton","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Education","Images":[{"FileName":"ac8ddf5c-c68d-414f-a3c9-1d4462002359.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"7d77434a-5eef-4b84-99ed-c4390deb8543.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cae453c8-28dc-4ee9-9a40-7dcd4b69ec27.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"10b1992c-b0b3-496b-b865-37426561cf40.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"0289e702-0daf-4f3d-a02b-a09267bb18fa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"be08df9e-616d-4df3-b459-233e18d317cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Talespin","Overview":"Talespin is an adventure game creation system made by Mark Heaton and his family (wife and their five children), which allows you to create interactive graphic- and text-oriented adventure games, demos, books, tutorials, or whatever application you can think of.

Once you have no bonus time, you can dig into your main score to provide more time.\n\nThere are two difficulty levels - the Novice level sees time elapse half as quickly as the Expert mode, and presents the levels in an approximate order of difficulty, whereas in Expert mode they are in randomised order.","Publisher":"Thalion","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/LZD6geB8H48"},"194152":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Tau Ceti","Region":"Europe"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ComTec","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"da0c222b-8ae3-4784-9868-0bca28f1f372.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"52b5805b-193e-48c5-a232-e2d76fc30b05.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"c057f9a3-2d49-48c0-bb26-937d78f9ec32.jpg","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a55344cc-bf1b-432a-8dea-d36977ccbd78.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"08e5120f-b22f-4709-a856-d4050c3bc63f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"cc5f0a47-53f6-4dbc-a28c-a5aae580ce8b.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"a2c3e212-9683-4139-9d5f-baf62e6e0dee.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a9dbcb82-ab61-49c6-b927-02e4199b7c67.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ed8059e7-42ac-4f4b-a65a-8bb41fd4e718.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Tau Ceti: The Lost Star Colony","Overview":"A space simulation with elements from a number of other genres mixed in.

Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes.\n\nThe tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving\/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.\n\nFinishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level.

The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.\n\nDriving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed. The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile boss vehicle to end the level. Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/2uKkfeni90U","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Total_Recall_(video_game)"},"194176":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Cloud Nine Developments","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"66f23758-f9e5-4553-a0ed-cb99172d5e8d.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"db6f0269-5a9d-49c1-a035-80f0afbb9317.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bd22a23a-cd30-4af7-bcd9-08b6670492db.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"7741ab20-7e77-4675-abce-e44ae1a385c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"63f6a051-06ef-4eeb-be60-cd4fb50fe792.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1d084c01-704d-48e3-9289-b539630e6384.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Touring Car Racer","Overview":"This game offers a simulation of the popular British Touring Car Championship of the early 90s.

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.\n\nTwo game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.\n\nThe question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art & Literature, Science & Nature, Geography, History, Sports & Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.\n\nOne additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/a2UzsSLiTDc"},"194194":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paragon Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d186104e-3327-4e28-825a-fb1c31cccde7.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e65377ac-bae3-4773-a9be-7d5f0f5d3067.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ed412d2b-bb4b-4576-9738-d76cc34ea419.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Twilight's Ransom","Overview":"An illustrated text adventure in the style of late-era Infocom.\n\nTwilight's Ransom is set in the fictional Liberty City, and casts the player as Ron Mulligan, a graphic artist in love with Maria Chavez, a Salvadoran immigrant working as a waitress and taking classes at the local college.

On the Atari, the sprites aren't quite as large as in arcade games, though.\n\nAt the start of a one-player game, two characters are available to play with: Terry from France and Sandy from London. All seven characters are available to choose from in two-player mode.\n\nEach player has the usual assortment of 18 jumps, kicks and punches, most of which are easily executed with a normal Atari joystick, as well as a few special moves. Some carry weapons, while some can fire energy bolts. Instead of the common best-out-of-three system, sudden death is enforced, so a opponent must be beaten on the first attempt. If you do so, another stands in line. Being pushed into a corner is also more dangerous than other similar games, since the ringside is electrified. Stay close to the centre of the arena, or you will be burnt to a crisp.\n\nReleased at the far end of the Atari's commercial life, Ultimate Arena is notable for being one of few STE-only games, which makes the digitised sounds and graphics more natural than had it been a normal ST game.","Publisher":"Steam","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1994,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/nZwuguPvOZo"},"194200":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gray Matter Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"51bd8724-4734-48c9-aa6d-d14f4fc6eabd.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"541848ab-8136-499c-ba8f-4760fd0d83eb.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f1403c3e-863d-4359-bb31-eb89154f5d11.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5ca455e2-3427-47c2-a2bc-3a43abf5d039.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5d953006-3a22-4966-bada-fecca002b884.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a9f8e697-0e1d-4d31-96ab-024cfc020838.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a3c37574-9307-4a57-9c4f-b95075ebe734.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The Ultimate Ride","Overview":"The Ultimate Ride is a first-person motorcycle racing game featuring six Japanese bikes to choose from.

To do so, the twelve astrological signs (with three levels each) have to be purged. The basic idea is that portals spit out spores which can be either good or evil. The goal is to produce enough good spores to overrun and destroy all evil portals before the screen is filled with bad spores.\n\nThe player has to manage the time resources because everything has to be done manually: shooting at the evil spore growth to drive it back and picking up good spores to create good spore portals at strategically useful positions. Additional gameplay elements are Guardians which fly around the screen and are unhealthy when touched, a night-time-rhythm which influence the spore growth and tarot cards which get revealed in regular intervals. These have either good or bad influences for the one who picks it up. There are three options to set the gameplay: action-oriented, strategy-oriented or mixed.","Publisher":"Electric Dreams","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/LoDqTpsO7xY?t=17","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wicked_(video_game)"},"194226":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Red Rat Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"1e098d46-f0f2-44cd-b1ec-94991d922fc2.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"93e0ffe7-aa8c-4860-b193-1f1f30f01abd.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05736737-59a3-4472-9742-6481859d921b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b4018d93-a7c3-49c3-a460-75acc68abdd5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"efcc65cc-c222-4c3d-a576-e81663baf69d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c7875841-2dfe-44ed-82b8-de2bafdb45a6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Wild Wheels","Overview":"Wild Wheels is an action game in which two teams of five cars each try to bring a ball into other team's goal for points (more points are awarded for risky moves) and destroying all enemy cars.

Both got married (though most probably not to each other) and begot children: the Wiz had a son, Wizkid, and Nifta had eight kittens. Their peaceful life ended when the evil mouse magician Zark kidnapped the Wiz, Nifta, and all the kittens, imprisoning them in different parts of the world. Wizkid must venture into unknown realms and rescue his father together with the feline family.\n\nWizkid is a sequel to Wizball. This game deviates from the original in many ways. The screen does not scroll and Wizkid does not bounce around like his predecessor. The player has full control over Wizkid and his movements. He has to be moved around the screen, bashing into bricks (which come in different shapes and sizes) so that the flying bricks collide with the onscreen enemies. Once the screen is cleared of all the enemies, coins are dropped, which must be picked up quickly before they disappear and the player proceeds to the next screen.\n\nKilling multiple enemies with a single brick releases a bubble that will sometimes offer a nose (to juggle bricks) or teeth (letting Wizkid grab hold of bricks), but more often they turn into colored notes. These must be combined to form tunes, as patterned at the top of the screen. Once the player completes a tune, you are taken to a shop where you can buy items needed to progress to the next stage.\n\nIf Wizkid has bashed all the bricks on a screen, but failed to remove all the enemies, the player may be taken to a puzzle screen, where he must solve Crossword 2091 for bonus money. The player has a number of words to put on the screen, but they must all overlap each other and use each other's letters. Each move has a time limit. If the player fails to complete the puzzle he is taken back to the level.\n\nWhen exiting a shop the player can choose either to exit as a head or a body, which is Wizkid with arms and legs. Assembles in this way, Wizkid is now limited by gravity and can jump around and use onscreen objects such as ringing bells or cranking wells. He may also come across interactive elements which he will need to use with items in his pockets. Most such levels require the player to solve inventory-based puzzles.","Publisher":"Ocean Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizkid:_The_Story_of_Wizball_II"},"194236":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"magnetic Scrolls","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"fa942f58-48b6-43f1-97c7-6ba0890cd1d9.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b66370f8-920b-47d4-9ca7-9655d074a483.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"fa8683c1-924b-4fd0-a0e8-e51d65483770.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"956ab743-2a83-4a2a-86b8-a6ed21a43e8e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"b74ae8af-8bcf-4e3c-9184-17c5d30711b5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Wonderland","Overview":"Alice was sitting at the river bank with her sister and got drowsy.

The player takes the role of an ambitious citizen who wants to become the mayor of Lübeck. To reach this goal he has to get rich by trading with other cities of the Hanseatic League.\n\nThe basic gameplay principle is simple: shipping salt and exchanging it for other goods which then can be sold in Lübeck for a good price. This means the current salt price is the most important part when planning shipments (besides the weather). Of course the player also has to purchase and maintain other things, e.g. a trading station, ships and cannons. Alternatively the player can also participate in smuggling.\n\nWhen using the game alone, the player competes against an AI opponent. He sometimes attacks the player's trading stations which results in a fight scene in which the player has to place his cannons so they destroy the attacking ships during the automatic attack phase. There are also other similar sequences and random occurrences like weddings or disasters that may force the player to react.
