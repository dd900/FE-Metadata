The game requires the engine be downloaded separately and to have the EXE and dlls put in the root folder to function (this is due to the engine’s EULA).\n\nGameplay is not unlike that of WarTech: Senko no Ronde. The player selects a pilot and a M.A.R.S. (Machines of Assured Resourceful Structures, the game’s gundam-like mechs).
