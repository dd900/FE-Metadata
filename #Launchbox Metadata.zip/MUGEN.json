It was built using the MUGEN engine with Acey as the lead designer, alongside Arkady, HyperSonic92 & ZVitor. The game showcases 27 Marvel favorites to select from, each getting their own movesets and abilities, with comic book-style cutscenes telling the story along the way.\n\nIn August of 2012, the team began work on a sequel to their release from a year prior, X-Men: Second Coming, having remarked that if anyone ever made a Black Widow template for MUGEN, they'd be required to follow through on a new project. Sure enough, Black Widow was made and the game was officially on the docket. Through collaboration with many great artists and programmers, the full game was released to acclaim on March 18, 2013, featuring solid visuals and gameplay.\n\nSecret Characters:\n• Capcom Captain America (Hold START while selecting Captain America)\n• Juggernaut (Hold START while selecting Colossus)\n• Deadpool (Move cursor over Spider-Man and press LEFT)\n• Green Hulk (Hold START while selecting Hulk)\n• Capcom Spider-Man (Hold START while selecting Spider-Man)","Publisher":"Infinity Mugen Team","ReleaseDate":"2013-08-26T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l7BSNVO5Jlo"},"122262":{"Cooperative":"false","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"cf5cc18b-b1f7-47a0-81f0-25b1f2637ff6.png","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Dragon Ball Z: Ultimate Fighter","Overview":"A M.U.G.E.N. fighter based in the Dragon Ball Z universe, with quite a lot of characters, who, I've been assured are all very distinct and have interesting backstories.

The game is notable for being the only hybrid of the two genres made for the engine, an irony given the engine for fighting games was originally designed for shooting games. The game requires the engine be downloaded separately and to have the EXE and dlls put in the root folder to function (this is due to the engine’s EULA).\n\nGameplay is not unlike that of WarTech: Senko no Ronde. The player selects a pilot and a M.A.R.S. (Machines of Assured Resourceful Structures, the game’s gundam-like mechs). While pilot selection has no effect on the gameplay at all, each mech fights in a very different manner, making for variety.","ReleaseType":"Homebrew"},"166079":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f2691ac4-e5f0-418d-af6a-bc96e1083798.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"4341e90c-652b-4ef9-a814-f6fbf3b78505.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"d866edfc-0bb0-4215-86ac-6f510ce789f0.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"36d01fff-0190-4b04-9b5a-133dc6829206.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Naruto MUGEN Battle Climax"},"166080":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"490d3307-9a72-466f-9cf6-61b2c06957c7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"0c773088-a027-4a0e-8f8b-f32ab0bff98c.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"22140e39-273a-4ad2-80d4-1d4d25d7fe66.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Naruto: The Last Revolution"},"166285":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"WOUNAMI","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"7c51b961-1be5-4d66-b3ed-ef8d4820f278.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"Name":"Namco X Capcom Brawlers","Overview":"MUGEN fighting game\n\nFeatures:\n- 33 characters\n- 16 stages","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2008,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.gamesdatabase.org\/Media\/SYSTEM\/MUGEN\/Video\/Formated\/Namco_X_Capcom_Brawlers.mp4"},"166325":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Anderson Halfeld","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"14e9184f-2c14-48f4-8a9a-9cfb90630236.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5966bee4-65e5-4b07-aebb-179b5c425eca.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"28923435-0a3a-4ea5-af5a-acbdd3b6dbfe.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"6b7bccbb-c93d-4ecd-b1e7-d580b268701a.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"51bbcd5e-0e98-45f9-9889-2b1c300290a9.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"The King of Fighters: Definitive Match","Overview":"The King of Fighters: Definitive Match brings balanced characters, beautiful HD backgrounds, a quality soundtrack and an evolving difficulty.

There's a mix of 25 playable good guys and bad guys from the DC universe, with lots of variety in the backgrounds and stages. The game is easy to pick up and play with a move list shown before each fight, while requiring some practice to master the combo system and special moves.\n\nThe original game from 1995 was notorious for bad control, choppy animations and a limited number of abilities. Justice League Task Force 2 corrects many of those flaws and brings new life to an old classic that never was.","Publisher":"Zvitor","ReleaseDate":"2020-02-07T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U4LamyLxxWI"},"183463":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"JesuSRenaut","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"b69e8efe-5c05-4d12-a278-b95c5c1d8b56.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ea234e7d-8861-45e9-aa92-1894ef1242d1.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2f38bfe2-a014-4885-a5d2-b85806d3d72c.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"c99aaf91-8692-4c80-ac45-d41f22eb6dba.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"b818be1c-f231-49cd-8193-baeaa9f9cf2c.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"74dc3082-04c5-4e3b-abf9-216b6f0509f9.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"52980090-5f4c-4e38-b531-e41efa36696b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a1d7df62-7371-40de-a89c-140035b039e8.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"249c75f4-5df9-4472-aabf-b195b25b4af0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e9d9a4e5-41b7-4d60-91fb-505b962e620d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"86bf7ca2-d516-43ae-bb3d-d2b2de30ea3b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"10ddff9e-ec39-49ba-846e-9e8af728b6f7.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"3f2747ff-c04c-4cc3-ab10-14a25a3f428e.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c8f3647a-5fde-462e-95b2-7426da692b4e.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"79c13e9b-bb77-42f4-b430-48c19ac64744.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Naruto Shippuden: Struggle Ninja","Overview":"Naruto Shippuden: Struggle Ninja features a fully animated screenpack, more than 100 playable characters and 71 different stages.\n\nFight other ninjas one by one in the classic Arcade mode, check the limit of your skills in Survival mode or team up with a friend and take on enemies simultaneously in a 2v2 slugfest.","Publisher":"JesuSRenaut","ReleaseDate":"2016-05-12T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rwv0dOgl63Y"},"183464":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Naruto Konoha Legends"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"TrafalgarLawzz","Genres":"Fighting","Images":[{"FileName":"f220878d-bd08-4e01-9b18-4b0a88fbdcf0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1de0d36a-88d8-4059-9a73-cbb92e8d86ba.png","Region":"World","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2a42279c-294c-4933-a638-62826ff8c3a6.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"16764033-23a8-435e-9605-4ebd1098223c.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"48a5b985-b042-46bf-8323-cb303656b197.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"5f26bce0-e166-4079-b217-f557f64ef929.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1f40f875-eab1-4dec-b1cf-81b2abb152e0.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a90ec4f3-14e4-4054-9a26-5c49f5b13af3.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Naruto: Konoha Legends","Overview":"Naruto: Konoha Legends is a fan-made fighting game created using the M.U.G.E.N. engine, formerly known as Naruto Ninja Battle V4.
