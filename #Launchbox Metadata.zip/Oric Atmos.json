{"Name":"Oric Atmos","Games":[{"DatabaseID":124839,"Name":"3D Fongus","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"3D Fongus is a flight racing game played from a third person perspective. The player flies over a desert where flags create the race track. Controls are limited to turning left and right. The player earns points for each pair of flags he flies through and also for flying over various things such as hedgehogs and cacti. There are also obstacles to watch out for such as rocks and rhinoceros that sometimes walks across the race track. The plane can take some damage but after five hits the game ends.\nAt some places the player will find holes in the ground that he can fly down into and enter a cavern. Going through a cavern shortens the length of the race and down there it's possible to find wrenches that repairs some of the plane's damage. The cavern is also the place of the yellow fungus which the player has to avoid since contact with it is lethal.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Racing; Vehicle Simulation","Developer":"Luc Edouard Thibaud","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124839,"FileName":"de1fddb4-ed22-452d-aaa0-73f265d26f89.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":124839,"FileName":"7e5c4de7-b588-4db1-bf0e-00717fb7f770.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":124839,"FileName":"6bed7af5-2305-4897-9888-657a34708ee4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":181151,"Name":"3D Luffar-Schack","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Unlike the name suggests, 3D Luffar-Schack is an English 3D TicTacToe in 2D.

Roadblocks and police cars are out to stop Bond, who can shoot his pistol at them to get them out of the way. The display is in three sections - an overhead map of Paris, a small 3D view from the car's point of view, and a scanner showing May Day's height. James must arrive at the right location to catch her as she lands.\n\nIn the second section, James must help Stacey Sutton escape from San Francisco City Hall, which is on fire. Each room is displayed from a side-on perspective. James must collect useful objects to get through the floors of the building, such as keys to open doors and buckets of water to stop the progress of the fire.\n\nIn the third and final section, James must collect the code numbers to stop the detonation of Zorin's bomb. Bond runs around the mine, avoiding rockfalls and long drops. Among the objects he can pick up are a grapnel gun (to fire ropes upward which he can climb to safety) and a plank of wood to bridge gaps. May Day is also somewhere in the mine.\n\nA password system lets the user play the second or third levels on their own without completing the first.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Domark","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":181913,"FileName":"3a4e2b4f-363e-4111-ab8d-158ef67e708d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":181913,"FileName":"b43550f5-f92a-4602-96db-0467f902c125.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":181913,"FileName":"9dca5297-e742-44bc-bf53-aa588edd503e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181913,"FileName":"01beed29-7a96-4179-a692-6e4c6c6f893a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":181913,"FileName":"54e69546-b9f7-4eeb-906f-7658f7403953.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":181913,"AlternateName":"A View to a Kill: The Computer Game","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":181913,"AlternateName":"007: Dangereusement Votre","Region":"France"}]},{"DatabaseID":194703,"Name":"A.T.M.","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"A French take on Chopper, though much more difficult.

You face a base in a cliff on the left of the screen and to destroy it you must fire missiles down three thin shafts in the cliff to destroy the power. Once all three shafts have been fired down then a gap moves up and down a wall in front of the base and you must shoot through the gap to destroy it. A helicopter keeps taking off and trying to destroy you while you fire your missiles.

Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten hearts can only appear at a give time. When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in.

There is no fire button: each time you press the move key, the ship shoots a laser beam.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmpUHO0n7k","Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Andrew Moore","Publisher":"Tansoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"56ceffc9-3818-4fea-ab65-7ab6a812b590.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"64c26bcc-ba59-4097-b146-a907de3d010f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"928b1e0b-0335-464c-8864-9dc4c4987691.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"fb24c7ea-152e-4de2-9ae4-535a5c032436.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"1dd988ae-9a63-46f4-b3fb-ffb7f9715497.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"97f75ac3-2e66-4c1a-bbbc-ac3a76fcbb9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"c9ed485e-1456-4ab3-9757-8686987dd62b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"502c606d-bfab-497a-918d-fad16a9dea9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"44378ab4-3310-4f7b-96a9-aabe96e41215.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159866,"FileName":"9199ed0f-6fb4-4989-8090-e8364551abf8.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175545,"Name":"Dig Dog","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Guide Max the Mutt to his long buried bones.

To increase the lovometer's score, the player must enter single keywords (verbs in infinitive). Each word represents an idea, enabling player to tell the lady about himself, pay her compliments, or make suggestions. Which words are successful depends on the girl's character. Several keywords lead to menus to specify the idea more precisely (for example, 5 menu items representing locations with different prices are shown on the word TRIP). The girl's reaction to a keyword is shown through her facial expression (smile, wink, kiss, etc.).\n\nBut seducing is not easy, because certain rules are in effect and unforeseen events can occur. The same word cannot be entered more than 3 times if it was used successfully, nor can the player see the sub-menus more than 3 times. An unsuccessful word may become successful later, however. Entering HELP or WORDS gives hints and a list of the game's vocabulary, but a fee must be paid for their use. Among the possible events are the appearance of a rival who steals the player's beloved. In addition, some tragic event may occur with the girl, such as her dog being eaten by bigger one, an acne attack, a toothache, losing her job, etc. In this case, the player should cheer her up with the right keyword.\n\nThere are 3 difficulty levels.

After locating a piece the player moves over it to pick it up and returns it to the bridge where it is properly put in place. What makes this harder are the enemy forces that do everything they can to stop the player from fulfilling his job. Planes, tanks, rockets and falling objects are all things that the player has to avoid or shoot down. Crashing into these, the ground or their projectiles will lead to a life being lost. The player also has to watch out for the helicopter's fuel level or else it might explode.

Before starting out it is possible to choose the speed of the attackers as well as the density of their missiles.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Shooter","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183929,"FileName":"f06438f3-ac38-44d9-9a6f-13e154f99d6e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":183929,"FileName":"89e3f685-47df-4896-8aea-64cfebe94932.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183929,"FileName":"61ad57ad-f02a-4836-a655-c7ed4a4287b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183930,"Name":"Gastronon","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183930,"FileName":"1bc50920-5122-4e9b-b6b0-af9aaa9e2270.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"},{"DatabaseID":183930,"FileName":"3b054111-f3a0-49bf-9921-d5dbd1fedcd3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183930,"FileName":"eb45261d-1dd4-4cd8-a12c-01e620c55943.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183930,"FileName":"785e4c58-964f-4cb1-8b11-aa6ce1d430ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175911,"Name":"Gest","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175911,"FileName":"f77825ce-040c-4ab7-9775-a005a7457cb9.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175564,"Name":"Ghost Gobbler","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175564,"FileName":"326bb3b7-08ab-462e-a8be-136e9e47615c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175846,"Name":"Ghostman","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Ghostman is a Pacman clone for the Oric computer.

One interesting little quirk to the game was that, it was possible to bomb your own ship as you took off from it.

The player must avoid the 'moving manholes' which will take away the tray or ingredient that they are carrying.\n\nOnce you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la Burger Time. The object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen.\n\nWhen the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next level.

Each level has a number of platforms connected with ladders that the player move between. On the platforms lies cheese that is meant to elicit the rats from their hideouts. As the rats run forth and back across the platforms the player has to move up to them and hit them in the head with his hammer.

The computer controls all the other characters in the game, including the headmaster, other teachers and other pupils.[1] The four teachers are Mr Wacker (the headmaster), Mr Rockitt (the science teacher), Mr Withit (the geography teacher) and Mr Creak (the history master). Other than Eric, three of the pupils are named: Boy Wander (the tearaway), Angelface (the bully) and Einstein (the swot). The player has the option of renaming the characters before the game begins.[2] There are also many unnamed, undistinguished pupils at the school. If Eric is caught out of class or otherwise misbehaving, teacher characters pursue him and issue lines.[3] When 10,000 lines or more are accumulated, the game ends with Eric's expulsion.[4] However, Eric can also receive lines for things that are not his fault, such as lying or sitting on the floor when in fact he has been knocked down, or being nearest a teacher who has just been hit by a projectile fired by one of the other pupils. So part of the challenge of the game is to prevent other pupils from getting Eric into trouble","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRrqAhyJ_uA","Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Chima Enquita","Publisher":"Defence Force","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175869,"FileName":"e6a2fb58-d035-4ceb-967d-c7162caf255d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175929,"Name":"Sorvivor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175929,"FileName":"dc4f2dd3-5b46-4ea2-bfa4-cdc1f95f8dd6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175619,"Name":"Spooky Mansion","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175619,"FileName":"27f94f45-b61a-4bbd-b53b-ab66dcc11a55.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175888,"Name":"Star","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175888,"FileName":"0b445ef8-1b18-4abb-b4db-97f6fc06e4d4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175721,"Name":"Starfighter","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Welcome to the game Starfighter.

Finally, you may sometimes surprise a monster, getting a free attack or the choice to retreat (which is not possible in a normal fight).","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ASP Software","Publisher":"ASP Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197397,"FileName":"1e5f69ee-a1d9-4184-a125-cd014a9a9d3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197397,"FileName":"d21f5607-796f-4cd8-8e22-ef9a36eb4f96.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175908,"Name":"Titan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175908,"FileName":"97d935ed-b920-4690-883c-944bc54deb53.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175656,"Name":"Transat One","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175656,"FileName":"45e376f0-8646-4d0d-bc5e-8a50243037b8.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":183936,"Name":"Triathlon","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Ere Informatique","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":183936,"FileName":"9e4cf938-7f3b-445c-8309-086f73ae9d50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183936,"FileName":"eb9d6113-07a5-4b57-8c49-626abd8525ce.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183936,"FileName":"901e48a6-592f-475f-9aad-00d0c1c78360.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":183936,"FileName":"250f2c63-98ee-47e2-bd3f-6e977d977c6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175565,"Name":"TrickShot","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175565,"FileName":"1db14aa6-bcbe-4195-948d-bac6d70333ea.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175661,"Name":"Trident De Neptune","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175661,"FileName":"81ac2020-bfd7-497f-846c-992187d4d469.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"France"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175566,"Name":"Tyrann","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175566,"FileName":"2e144b43-512f-4cc6-8520-6b8e0b3d051a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":159848,"Name":"Ultima Zone","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Ultima Zone is an arcade action game that consists of three stages with different gameplay.\n\nBattlezone: The player controls his space craft left and right and has to shoot monsters knows as walkons that appear in front of him. Beneath the player are three cages with bouncing ball-like creatures called brunes. When a walkon is killed it releases a fireball that when hitting a cage releases the brunes. To complete the stage the player has to kill all walkons and brunes while avoiding being hit by the brunes or the projectiles that are dropped. The player can use the 'Radoy Shield' to protect their ship for a limited time. Shield energy is shown by the yellow gauge on top of the screen. Destroying a walkon resets the gauge.\n\nThe Trap: The player controls his space craft like before but in front of him he has only one cruiser (which is called henk-class) and three brunes (stationary this time). To kill the brunes the player manipulates the cruiser by shooting at its control panels. The left panel makes it go up, the right down and the central fires the cruiser's lateral maser. This stage must be cleared within a limited amount of time (the timer is the red gauge).\n\nOrbit Runner: Similar to Frogger the player guides a missile through orbital defences with the aim of destroying a walkon spy satellite. The player can move left, right and forward but not shoot.\n\nOnce all three stages has been completed the game restarts at a higher level.\n\nThe player controls the ship with the following keyboard keys :\n'Ctrl' key : move left.\n'A' key : move right.\n'Return' key : Fire (Stage 1 & 2) or Accelerate (Stage 3).\n'Del' key : Deploy the Radoy Shield (Stage 1).\n[edit description | view history]","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VY9I-V1FACs","Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Andy Green","Publisher":"Tansoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"6dd03830-5a16-4b07-bdeb-169a5821e4d8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"77e20707-6b30-42f2-b7e7-d9e6cb5b3dcc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"b6a6cd41-c60c-49aa-92a6-1aa0be55aaec.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"a0db9b53-edea-48d6-b766-5bc0677be10c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"9ef9d91a-63ac-4837-93d3-bbd2ff6e6575.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"bb4a7926-d38d-40b7-b722-dcfe2000454c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"5bfafb62-8c3c-4df8-b020-db3e8c2f8f5f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"132da2de-2c7c-4b16-b90b-d1bc1b21d1ed.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"24b58761-ef0b-417b-a3f3-08f4b7caab53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"9a525095-fe25-4fa5-b1c0-168648abf864.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"f7764bd1-0577-4600-97b0-131427fb2607.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":159848,"FileName":"701a3c07-1a38-425b-8820-789f8f105be5.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175849,"Name":"Velnor's Lair ","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Earth is in trouble from the Black Wizard Velnor, as he has finally found the tomb of Grako to turn himself into a demon.

On the route he will have to overpass many enemies and dangers before having a chance on destroying the Zorgon Battle Star.\n\nXenon 1 is at its core a fixed screen shoot 'em up. It consists of five levels each with a different take on the genre. The first two levels are similar to Moon Cresta. In the first level the player is up against the Aards, birdlike monsters that move in circles above the player. Sometimes they shoot at the player and sometimes they move down and try crashing into him. The second level works similarly but here the player has to destroy bigger variants of the Aards. These are cloned when hit, with one of the clones diving towards the player and exploding when reaching the base line. The third level is without shooting. Here the player moves through a meteor belt and has to get through it without crashing.\n\nIn the fourth level the player arrives at the planet Radon. Here he will be up against paratrons, parachuting creatures that jump towards the player from the top. Depending on skill level there are between 10-30 enemies that have to be shot down. The fifth level is the final battle against the Zorgon Battle Star. To destroy it the player has to hit its moving nuclear reactor. A bonus is awarded depending on how long it takes. On all levels the player has a limited amount of fuel and will die if he runs out of it. To avoid this the player will need to refuel at the mothership's service bay.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHsY1oky7Nw","Platform":"Oric Atmos","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"John S.
