The player flies over a desert where flags create the race track. Controls are limited to turning left and right. The player earns points for each pair of flags he flies through and also for flying over various things such as hedgehogs and cacti. There are also obstacles to watch out for such as rocks and rhinoceros that sometimes walks across the race track. The plane can take some damage but after five hits the game ends.\nAt some places the player will find holes in the ground that he can fly down into and enter a cavern. Going through a cavern shortens the length of the race and down there it's possible to find wrenches that repairs some of the plane's damage. The cavern is also the place of the yellow fungus which the player has to avoid since contact with it is lethal.","Publisher":"Loriciels","ReleaseYear":1985},"124840":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Louie-Marie Rocques","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"cb2ec4e8-9adc-4d0e-be5b-bee45a6126e5.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1535d282-f148-45e2-855f-4474c1038022.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"468e0ecc-825d-429f-99c9-6493cffb1109.png","Region":"France","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c7a54b96-788f-4701-a4c7-66f8139d65ad.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6e9a8d92-b2bf-4fae-9a1f-9d99916d0dc2.png","Region":"France","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"L'Aigle d'Or","Overview":"L'Aigle d'Or is an action-adventure game and the first episode of a series.\n\nThe location is Eagle's Castle in Westphalia.

To complete the stage the player has to kill all walkons and brunes while avoiding being hit by the brunes or the projectiles that are dropped. The player can use the 'Radoy Shield' to protect their ship for a limited time. Shield energy is shown by the yellow gauge on top of the screen. Destroying a walkon resets the gauge.\n\nThe Trap: The player controls his space craft like before but in front of him he has only one cruiser (which is called henk-class) and three brunes (stationary this time). To kill the brunes the player manipulates the cruiser by shooting at its control panels. The left panel makes it go up, the right down and the central fires the cruiser's lateral maser. This stage must be cleared within a limited amount of time (the timer is the red gauge).\n\nOrbit Runner: Similar to Frogger the player guides a missile through orbital defences with the aim of destroying a walkon spy satellite. The player can move left, right and forward but not shoot.\n\nOnce all three stages has been completed the game restarts at a higher level.\n\nThe player controls the ship with the following keyboard keys :\n'Ctrl' key : move left.\n'A' key : move right.\n'Return' key : Fire (Stage 1 & 2) or Accelerate (Stage 3).\n'Del' key : Deploy the Radoy Shield (Stage 1).\n[edit description | view history]","Publisher":"Tansoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VY9I-V1FACs"},"159866":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Andrew Moore","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"56ceffc9-3818-4fea-ab65-7ab6a812b590.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"64c26bcc-ba59-4097-b146-a907de3d010f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"928b1e0b-0335-464c-8864-9dc4c4987691.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"fb24c7ea-152e-4de2-9ae4-535a5c032436.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"97f75ac3-2e66-4c1a-bbbc-ac3a76fcbb9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"44378ab4-3310-4f7b-96a9-aabe96e41215.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"502c606d-bfab-497a-918d-fad16a9dea9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c9ed485e-1456-4ab3-9757-8686987dd62b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1dd988ae-9a63-46f4-b3fb-ffb7f9715497.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9199ed0f-6fb4-4989-8090-e8364551abf8.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Defence Force","Overview":"Defence Force is a clone of the game Defender: a side scrolling shoot'em up where you have to defend humans.\n\nHumanity has been almost totally destroyed.

It's now up to the player in the role as a fleet commander in the Xenon Space Academy to travel to it and defend it from the attack. On the route he will have to overpass many enemies and dangers before having a chance on destroying the Zorgon Battle Star.\n\nXenon 1 is at its core a fixed screen shoot 'em up. It consists of five levels each with a different take on the genre. The first two levels are similar to Moon Cresta. In the first level the player is up against the Aards, birdlike monsters that move in circles above the player. Sometimes they shoot at the player and sometimes they move down and try crashing into him. The second level works similarly but here the player has to destroy bigger variants of the Aards. These are cloned when hit, with one of the clones diving towards the player and exploding when reaching the base line. The third level is without shooting. Here the player moves through a meteor belt and has to get through it without crashing.\n\nIn the fourth level the player arrives at the planet Radon. Here he will be up against paratrons, parachuting creatures that jump towards the player from the top. Depending on skill level there are between 10-30 enemies that have to be shot down. The fifth level is the final battle against the Zorgon Battle Star. To destroy it the player has to hit its moving nuclear reactor. A bonus is awarded depending on how long it takes. On all levels the player has a limited amount of fuel and will die if he runs out of it. To avoid this the player will need to refuel at the mothership's service bay.","Publisher":"IJK Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qHsY1oky7Nw"},"166641":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"John S.

In contrast to other text-based games of the period which were based on simple verb-noun parsers, Inglish allowed for complete sentences to be entered.","Publisher":"Melbourne House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1983},"175542":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"c20f913a-96ee-413a-8f70-5f99dac9523e.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"eca1ef8b-4413-4650-862c-93009c1afc78.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"279d787d-8fc4-48b3-a3c0-dc2eb4a423c8.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"638d25d6-3e3e-4f56-93d8-d2115adcfb6f.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"Name":"Mr. Wimpy","Overview":"Mr. Wimpy is a one-player game, where the character controls Mr. Wimpy whose favorite hobby is making tasty hamburgers. In level one, you are required to bring back each ingredient (cheese, beef patty, and sausage) separately on each of the three trays provided. The player must avoid the 'moving manholes' which will take away the tray or ingredient that they are carrying.\n\nOnce you have done this, you'll advance a level where the gameplay changes a la Burger Time. The object is to make four burgers, and you do this by running over ingredients including either cheese or lettuce, beef patties, and the two hamburger buns, to make them fall onto the level below you without coming in contact with evil onions, hot dogs, and egg yolks. If you are unfortunate enough to come in contact with these nasties, you'll lose one of your five lives, unless you sprinkle pepper on them. Note that you only have a limited supply of pepper, so to get more, you need to travel to the top level and get cups of coffee or sundaes that move around the screen. Another way to deal with these enemies is to wait until one of them gets under an ingredient, and squash them by running over the ingredient. They will get squashed only to get resurrected somewhere on the screen.\n\nWhen the ingredients are at the bottom level and you run over them, they will drop onto one of the four burgers at the bottom of the screen. When you make all four burgers, you proceed to the next level. The more levels you proceed, the more difficult your quest is."},"175543":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"6ee09839-4eb4-4078-b27a-526037953a51.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b749f38a-d67c-45b6-b075-6956145e5756.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"832e8626-3bdb-4568-8d24-c0e85ac05de0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"26fa99de-cb03-484b-9b5b-9f1b727211b2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"88221711-4998-4244-bfb5-44e2bbfdbfe5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Hell's Temple"},"175544":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"04557ef3-d5d2-4406-ace2-bdbc9e91c9aa.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Dinky Kong"},"175545":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"34488604-4046-4dfd-a733-edf167267bba.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"ab54f4f2-3b0b-4fd9-b924-bf2670ee484b.JPG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d2d68dc1-f1ea-4aac-ad17-ffa0629b0d5b.JPG","Region":"Europe","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"527c1792-ae98-4110-bd91-b3e0abca457c.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ce48aa38-c0bc-435c-af7b-09ffe08b3106.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"cfdf7d6f-a3c4-45be-95ee-6b389018d56c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"81f4ab11-100f-46b7-8302-7af5d7af2a42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dig Dog","Overview":"Guide Max the Mutt to his long buried bones.

All of these instruments, indicating the stages of the mission, the attitude of the craft and its course, as well as altitude and speed, are functional. Certain parts of the mission are moved to an outside view for pædagogical reasons.

The bridge is needed so that a truck can enter enemy territory. The problem is that the pieces of the bridge are scattered around five interconnected screens that the player has to traverse from a side view perspective. After locating a piece the player moves over it to pick it up and returns it to the bridge where it is properly put in place. What makes this harder are the enemy forces that do everything they can to stop the player from fulfilling his job. Planes, tanks, rockets and falling objects are all things that the player has to avoid or shoot down. Crashing into these, the ground or their projectiles will lead to a life being lost.

The cock automatically goes into the back room to mate with his wife, who lays an egg shortly afterwards. After this, it is up to the player to make sure that there is at least one egg among the two rows of nests, and that the egg is not destroyed by snakes, rats, raccoons, porcupines, and the like that are smart enough to climb the ladders leading up to the nests. The creatures enter the henhouse from either side, and must be moved along by pecking at them. As the cock walks around the henhouse, its energy will decrease. It must be replenished by eating chicken feed at both sides of the henhouse. Only then will the cock move faster. Upon entering the back room, the player must wait until one or more hearts appear at the top of the screen, as they indicate the number of eggs the mother will lay. Since there are ten nests, up to ten hearts can only appear at a give time. When an egg sits in the nest long enough, a egg will hatch out, and the resulting chick will make its way toward the back room, ring the bell outside the door, then go on in. If one of the creatures destroy an egg, or the only egg in the nest hatches out, the player loses a life, and the game is over when all lives are lost."},"175852":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"3acd2183-a07e-441e-9109-ccc6fd8316eb.jpg","Region":"France","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Le Fer D'Amnukor"},"175853":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Guillaume Saviard","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"c9ad938d-fd7f-486d-9417-819af2874ed5.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"9ca89272-0492-40f6-9805-f75775f10bf7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"1c73e588-d05c-4e9e-b164-907c95a7c7d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"2cf4da25-4f30-489f-9b00-70a3eab28806.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c88b06d1-f686-4d4b-9c80-61b53ac6e0df.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e9ffc50e-2336-4ef6-8a3f-7c2cb1a2b881.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6504006d-745d-4e7d-ab7b-88364f3cc8bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Crypt Show","Overview":"A French language adventure game where you explore the deadly crypt.","Publisher":"Norsoft","ReleaseDate":"1984-10-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"175854":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Addictive Games Ltd","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation; Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"d6eaf113-eb1b-4274-a193-07e5c424623f.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"cc1687cc-830d-4535-b9e2-7460070ee131.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"899efe26-1014-4d03-8ea5-ece33eaa754b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"49164efb-648f-4e16-96b2-1041e57edec8.PNG","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"029aa645-4993-40bb-9de8-8c94789cbbec.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Football Manager","Overview":"The football management game style has been one of the most enduring since Kevin Toms pioneered it in 1982.

Each word represents an idea, enabling player to tell the lady about himself, pay her compliments, or make suggestions. Which words are successful depends on the girl's character. Several keywords lead to menus to specify the idea more precisely (for example, 5 menu items representing locations with different prices are shown on the word TRIP). The girl's reaction to a keyword is shown through her facial expression (smile, wink, kiss, etc.).\n\nBut seducing is not easy, because certain rules are in effect and unforeseen events can occur. The same word cannot be entered more than 3 times if it was used successfully, nor can the player see the sub-menus more than 3 times. An unsuccessful word may become successful later, however. Entering HELP or WORDS gives hints and a list of the game's vocabulary, but a fee must be paid for their use. Among the possible events are the appearance of a rival who steals the player's beloved.

The game starts with the famous movie intro sequence of the moving gunsight and Bond shooting towards the camera.\n\nIn the first section set in Paris, James Bond commandeers a taxi to follow May Day who has parachuted from the Eiffel Tower. Roadblocks and police cars are out to stop Bond, who can shoot his pistol at them to get them out of the way. The display is in three sections - an overhead map of Paris, a small 3D view from the car's point of view, and a scanner showing May Day's height. James must arrive at the right location to catch her as she lands.\n\nIn the second section, James must help Stacey Sutton escape from San Francisco City Hall, which is on fire. Each room is displayed from a side-on perspective. James must collect useful objects to get through the floors of the building, such as keys to open doors and buckets of water to stop the progress of the fire.\n\nIn the third and final section, James must collect the code numbers to stop the detonation of Zorin's bomb. Bond runs around the mine, avoiding rockfalls and long drops. Among the objects he can pick up are a grapnel gun (to fire ropes upward which he can climb to safety) and a plank of wood to bridge gaps. May Day is also somewhere in the mine.\n\nA password system lets the user play the second or third levels on their own without completing the first.","Publisher":"Domark","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1985,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_View_to_a_Kill_(video_game)"},"183927":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"3675ee37-c137-4956-9fec-0cc2fe21ceac.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5d7fdc45-5e25-4002-b537-251390926462.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a5429ad2-afa5-4579-a9a9-b8482f0d7a0b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Acheron's Rage","Overview":"Acheron's Rage is an shoot 'em up game with some resemblances to games like Asteroids and Omega Race.
