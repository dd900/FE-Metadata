After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game's manual. The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.\n\nSolving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together. Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis. Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful. \n\nBefore solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge. Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith. Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz. If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fskEnzAo0ug","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure; Puzzle; Strategy","Developer":"Datasoft","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"365cd0e7-8d49-4276-bd75-df20ec4548be.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"bba2ca7f-7391-40a3-a31f-0bdee206fe1b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"1bf00560-6704-424a-b625-fdfcdce10c48.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"ddb44d9d-eaed-424a-b670-17eb12396742.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"659aedf5-155c-4e12-890e-074875556f51.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"695a7c59-f007-4531-8b13-e2d13f28f560.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124585,"FileName":"10e6941e-345b-4532-a942-9afe32aff953.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":124585,"AlternateName":"221B Baker Street","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":122875,"Name":"2400 A.D.","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Metropolis was founded in 2213 A.D. by the United Stellar Council as the capital city of the planet XK-120, a mining planet and center of learning throughout the galaxy. That was the past. In 2315 A.D., Metropolis is invaded by the Tzorg. The new conquerer leave the planet but install a Robot Patrol System to keep the locals in check. Now the only resistance against the Tzorg occupation is a small group of resistance fighters of the Underground network. In the year 2400 A.D. the final hope to overthrow Tzorg rule over the city is to infiltrate the Tzorg Authority Complex through a recently discovered secret route, access the terminals, and shut down the robots; that is, if they had a computer specialist.\n\nThat's where the protagonist comes in. As part of yet another shipment of miners from other conquered Tzorg lands to replace the 'disappearances' of past workers, the hero has been contacted by the Underground to join their struggle against the Tzorg. The contact leaves instructions: find Spider, contact the Underground, good-bye and good luck.\n\n2400 A.D. is a top-down role-playing game that has similarities to Ultima games, though with simpler gameplay mechanics. The city of Metropolis is divided into five areas: Center, North, South, East, West. All of which are indicated by borders, guarded and patrol by different kinds of robots. Non-player characters also frequent the city. An attempt to communicate with them will open dialog boxes, where the player must type in keywords for further information.\n\nExploration and transportation may be conducted via three approaches: walking, using the \"slidewalk\" (automated sidewalk), or by using subway system. The city contains a few merchants where the player may purchase some items. More curious items such as weapons and personal devices, however, are rumored to be sold by the Underground. Throughout the city, there are also power nodes, which allow the player to recharge weapons and other devices. Use of these power nodes are illegal by the Tzorg Authority, prompting a possible robot dispatch to the area, or if any robots are in the immediate vicinity, to attack the character.\n\nThe main character has four primary attributes: Energy (equivalent to hit points and strength combined), Dexterity, IQ, and Affinity. During character creation, the player may allocate 99 points among these attributes. These attributes will increase during gameplay when the character performs certain actions. Affinity, for example, may increase when the character talks to NPCs.\n\nCombat initiates when the player character attacks or is attacked by an enemy robot. Before engaging in combat, the hero must first equip a ranged weapon in the inventory (a maximum of eight items) and recharge the weapon. The character cannot attack if no charged weapon is equipped. Combat flows in real time, pausing when the player selects an attack. The protagonist may only shoot in a diagonal or vertical direction, while robots have the advantage to attack in all nine directions. If the character is hit, all attributes will be decreased. The attributes will return to their original scores over time. If the protagonist succeeds in defeating a robot, he may search the remains and obtain money. Defeat will result in imprisonment and confiscation of items at the Rehabilitation Center, where the protagonist must also register regularly to avoid being thrown into prison. Robots will re-spawn after a certain amount of time.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i39IRWaIBj0","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"bfff9440-b6ac-4302-a53d-c8801ad0171c.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"8240230e-2550-4dba-be65-f84dc7eda166.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"16fb0057-7627-4a37-8d0b-25379756866c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"fb4319e8-46b8-4b69-bdc0-403052159d95.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"34b53116-be00-4b30-b087-ba51bb2edffa.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"77abead7-b053-4216-83a8-5850c12650b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":122875,"FileName":"1ed6b1bf-bef9-421c-91ec-ee40b70e229a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124659,"Name":"3 in 1 College & Pro Football","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"3 in 1 College & Pro Football is a text-based American football simulator.\n\nAn all-strategy football simulator done entirely in text.

The game is over when all six cities are destroyed, and the final score awards both ammo conservation and the number of incoming missiles intercepted.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81fGQUnm5w4","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Muse Software","Publisher":"Muse Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"7f69de6e-1811-47f7-9b15-eff8b560c9c4.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"594a3e4f-b8bf-4fc7-b820-7e1fa04bb4b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"2643da0a-d451-4c22-b6d3-f5d1ee4a8844.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"c833b3d4-ff11-4496-9380-be58a1de3c1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"bfdc5fec-e62b-42c7-999c-cf77088bbd49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"89e4e840-fcc2-4ab3-bccc-2d3638f71480.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"1f6e5f78-a9b4-42f4-a5ea-02705221b318.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":156176,"FileName":"0f986c23-6ac8-42d2-a485-642ed3dc0806.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156176,"AlternateName":"ABM","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":132083,"Name":"Accolade's Comics featuring Steve Keene Thrillseeker","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"A young boy reads his favorite comic book about secret agent Steve Keene.

Each character has a helmet camera and a smart gun, each controlled by the player acting in the role of overall operational commander.\n\nThe player can switch to any character at any time, and must consider coordinating their movements and finding a safe location before switching to the next character. Characters occupy one room at a time, and can pan their view a full 360-degrees inside each room. Doors can be locked to halt Alien progress, or blasted open to get through (at the cost of permanently destroying the door). Alien bio-mass must also be destroyed before it spawns facehuggers, and the Aliens themselves leave lethal puddles of acid when killed (and so shouldn't be killed in front of doors!).\n\nAliens prowl the complex and are attracted to gunfire. They will home in on nearby characters and attack, requiring the player to aim that character's gun to defend against the rushing Alien (a headshot kills instantly, while three to the body do the same). If an Alien attacks a character the player is not controlling, they will \"capture\" that character (indicated by a yellow status light). The player must guide another character to the position of the hostage and kill the guarding Alien to rescue them. If not, the captured character will be lost.\n\nAmmunition for all characters is limited, and refilled only by making a trip to the complex's armory. Similarly, a medical bay can replenish any damage. Characters also have limited stamina, used up with every move made. When stamina is low, the player must find a safe spot for that character to rest up. The complex also houses a generator controlling the lights, which the Aliens can destroy, or the Marines can then repair.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzoIoORPXOM","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Alan B.

Wilderness Campaign (1979) offered a similar approach to gameplay but in an overland map rather than a dungeon. Odyssey: The Compleat Apventure (1980) fused the two approaches by offering both a wilderness map and a dungeon map (along with a new sea map) in the same game. (Links are to my posts on the three games.) The games were created and programmed by Robert Clardy and published by Synergistic Software.\n\nApventure is a direct sequel to Odyssey, beginning on the island, and in the castle, conquered by the player at the end of that game. The back story does a good job elaborating on the story of Odyssey without contradicting it. In Odyssey, we learned that the game world, the Sargalo Sea and its islands, was separated from the rest of the world by a wizard called the High One. He figured if he could wall off the Sargalo Sea from its enemies, he could use the years to better develop the martial capacities of his citizens and be ready to contend with exterior threats when the wall came down.

One of the most important tasks is to keep it alive because the spawn points (an additional respectively new base appears) are far between - which means the player may have to survive without replenishment for a few levels when the base is destroyed. Enemies also drop parachutes which turn into submarines after reaching the water surface.

Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.\n\nHowever, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.\n\nUnlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard & the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.\n\nThe different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.\n\nArchon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8jEB6XERLI","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Jim Nitchals","Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"956641d0-ab12-4c61-9b70-c19f493cad86.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"16df7c94-4f9e-4a6d-9eda-b7d84f2bef77.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"e6c21f4d-587e-49d0-b252-6193c83ebd1e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"e8506630-03e6-4d9e-9f83-1a8e8950f579.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"fbdf4d36-ab26-41a4-a443-86de690befc0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"cf97e666-bca9-49b7-8b7a-9739bd472f9f.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"fc33f96d-bf38-4d80-ba04-de7cb678f788.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"63125ca5-89d5-4bb6-b09d-0138fe58e55c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124678,"FileName":"f43c13df-3a2e-40a6-9dc3-4a2f81fcd081.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":124678,"AlternateName":"Archon","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":124680,"Name":"Arcticfox","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"In 2005, aliens have taken over Antarctica.

It was originally released for the Atari 8-bit family, then ported to the Atari 5200, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX. and later the Atari 7800 and the Nintendo Famicom. The game was called Ballblaster during development; pirated versions of the game went by this name as well.  The principal creator and programmer of Ballblazer was David Levine\n\nBallblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer. Each side is represented by a craft called a \"rotofoil\", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled \"droid\" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.\n\nA player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.\n\nPushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into \"sudden death\", where the first player to score wins.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8FXUy__UBI","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games LLC","Publisher":"Epyx, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133943,"FileName":"08e9477b-f9a9-4eb9-a4bb-55af048a482c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133943,"FileName":"fa0a5775-8869-41ed-b98f-3b65ea65ef2c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133943,"FileName":"b0d5a93d-479c-44e5-beb1-456485368baf.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133943,"FileName":"dbb7e13c-9044-418a-8585-1c529110f3f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133943,"FileName":"0d73ae81-9680-4814-9790-3a95284f13bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125198,"Name":"Ballyhoo","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Ballyhoo is a mystery text adventure in which you play a disillusioned circus goer who decides to help find the owner's kidnapped daughter.\n\nGameplay involves searching for clues in the circus arena, the tents and other back areas trying to locate the girl.

As the German Commander your hope for victory is to deploy your land forces and powerful panzers and contain the enemy and drive him back to the beaches. Either way you have until noon on June 30th (25 days) to accomplish your mission at which time your position will be evaluated.

Successfully completing it gives a surprise advantage in the following General Quarters sequence, where the player controls anti-aircraft guns shooting down enemy aircraft.\n\nThe next sequence is named Battle Stations and the player must aim and fire heavy guns to hit enemy ships before they inflict too much damage and eventually sink the player's own vessels. Following this battle, the fleet must be maneuvered to the beach. Upon reaching the Beach-Head level, tanks roll out and the player must keep these safe from enemy fire and obstacles while driving. In the Final Battle sequence, the Dictator is holed up in the fortress of Kuhn-Lin and 10 different targets on the fortress must be fired upon to destroy it.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qAP4y0k7h4","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sculptured Software","Publisher":"Access Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"87e6ef1b-f252-4aff-ae7a-cc393d2216f9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"6c0377f1-9425-460a-a248-e03076f6a74b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"fd9a6d03-e5c4-4143-81ac-530685d55000.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"9f949c3c-82e2-46c1-b9ff-43e40ba0fa50.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"bfb96518-a03c-433a-8cdc-afe28258f61d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"623abd83-9bf5-4833-b020-5fd8718b1dad.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":202251,"FileName":"f312ad92-5776-42bb-b22c-3fd1885be565.png","Type":"Screenshot - High Scores","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":202251,"AlternateName":"Beach Head","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":134155,"Name":"Beach-Head II: The Dictator Strikes Back","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Beach-Head II features the player pursuing the eponymous Dictator in several ways. There are four levels in the game. In the first level, called Attack, the player deploys soldiers along a path with walls to cover him from the dictator's gun. The objective is to destroy the gun. The second level involves rescuing the prisoners from deadly obstacles by clearing them with a gun. The third level's objective is to escape from the area by flying a helicopter with the prisoners out of the dictator's fortress. Finally the player and the dictator face off, on opposite cliffs, separated by water. To defeat him, the player must make him fall in the water by throwing knives at him. The Dictator tries to do the same to the player. In one player mode there are three skill levels, harder modes resulting in faster movements and the computer opponent using better artificial intelligence. In two player mode, one player controls the usual side whilst his opponent controls the Dictator's forces. This game was notable for using synthesized speech (courtesy of Electronic Speech Systems, then of Berkeley, California).

Following the events in those books, The Kindar and the Erdling societies have joined together. However unrest and distrust still remains. An old woman, D'ol Falla has heard the words \"The Spirit fades, in Darkness lying. A quest proclaim, the Light is dying\". Choosing one of five available people (of different ages and of either Kindar or Erdling descent) either she believes can help, D'ol Falla assigns the quest of discovering what these words mean and how to quell the racial and political tensions building between the races.\n\nBelow the Root is a adventure game and a platform game. Choosing one of five characters (each very different from one another), the player explores the tree-based lands Erdling and the underground-based lands of the Kindar. As an adventure game, goals are primarily accomplished by talking to people (though each character is treated differently by others) and finding the right items to use in specific situations, but also dealing with the challenges of level design in a platform game.\n\nEach character can obtain different items to help with their movement as well as psychic abilities such as pensing (telepathy), kiniporting (telekinesis) and grunspreking (plant manipulation). Violence is abhorred among the Kindar and the Erdling and violent actions tend to harm the player's reputation. Kindar or Erdling factions may kidnap the player's character if they wander into the wrong areas, throwing them into a local \"prison house\" from which they must escape. The player must eat constantly to retain their energy, however Erdling characters do not eat meat.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Dale Disharoon, Inc.","Publisher":"Windham Classics","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133562,"FileName":"f962a5ca-ff9e-4f6b-851d-439f87bad446.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133562,"FileName":"0dbf7a08-1235-4d0c-83d3-ca6d318192e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133562,"FileName":"730fb31c-8bb7-4157-bbf3-b1d3ceac5c4a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133562,"FileName":"72fbca89-c008-42ea-ab87-9e9f35879fa8.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133562,"FileName":"c8f1f5cf-0a62-4e1f-a92d-2e1cc80e700a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133562,"FileName":"48a4b7d3-6f94-450f-95d0-cceaa392cc04.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134157,"Name":"Beneath Apple Manor","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Beneath Apple Manor is an early roguelike game released by Don Worth for microcomputers, which had a Lo-Res Apple release in 1978 (through The Software Factory) and high-res multi-platform releases in 1982 and 1983 (through Quality Software).

These can be determined by the player at the beginning of the game, randomly chosen by the game, or provided as part of a pre-generated character. The attributes affect the outcome of combat, which occurs in certain locations. They can also be raised or lowered during the game by gaining experience, drinking and eating certain items, wearing accessories, or in another fashion (sometimes humorous - for example, intelligence will be lowered by typing in swear words).

The player's objective is to find the six eyeballs scattered across the land which are needed to pass the Blind Statue. Once the eyes are placed back in the Blind Statue's empty sockets, a message appears explaining how to end Zahgrim's rule over the land once and for all. It is achieved by entering his castle, a wicked and difficult maze of traps and monsters.\n\nEvery 4000 points, a new rank is awarded. There are four ranks: apprentice, wizard, sorcerer, necromancer.\n\nThe gameplay involves moving through a large, side-view scrolling world, collecting items, shooting arrows at enemies, and casting spells. The world scrolls both vertically and horizontally, and most areas within it do not have to be visited in a fixed order. Resources are limited. You are always on the verge of running out of food, and arrows are also in short supply. When one of the statue's eyes is collected, new types of monsters appear in the world making travel more difficult. This makes the game play differently depending on the order the eyes are collected.\n\nSpells provide alternate approaches to problems. You can turn yourself invisible, for example, so monsters can't hurt you. Or you can freeze water so the creatures in it cannot move. New spells are unlocked with each rank.\n\nA large bird can carry you to a different part of the world, similar to the bat in Adventure for the Atari 2600.

Lose all five balls, and the game will give you a frank verbal evaluation: 720 is a perfect score, while under 100 will earn you the questionable award of \"terrible!\".

The intent was to showcase the feasibility of implementing such a game, in an accessible programming language, on a consumer-level machine: until then, this was possible using expensive, custom hardware. Remakes of this game would later surface on the Apple II (and derivatives), including Brick Out and Little Brick Out.\n\nThe other side of the tape held Color Demos, a succinctly-titled collection of routines showing off the machine's graphics capabilities.

For authenticity and historical detail, the tactical game puts you on the quarterdeck where you will make all the decisions real captains had to make.\n\nIf you wish to depart from the historical ships provided, you can design your own frigates and ships of the line from the keel up to rigging, arming and manning them. The game ends when either ship wins or at 6pm, whichever comes first. You will win if you sink the enemy ship, or accumulate enough points to force the enemy ship to surrender. You will lose if your crew size goes below one quarter of its original size or if 11 enemy crew members manage to board your ship and there are no standing friendly crew members occupying any of the first 10 boarding positions on your ship. If both ships sink, or no one wins by 6pm, the game is a draw.

The player must avoid these flying saucers by maneuvering out of their way or by shooting them down. In sector 1.3., a new type of robot spaceship (at least one) will fly erratically and attempt to crash into the player's space ship (due to the marvel of technology of that era, enemy ships that disappear from one side of the screen, will emerge on the other side of the screen).

Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud that will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.\n\nHigher levels result in new level design, faster enemies and more ingredients to assemble.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw93Qlw89tA","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Data East Corporation","Publisher":"Mattel Electronics","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"56894493-5fc2-48a0-9f26-bf298ecb1dea.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"ac29b6c0-4c52-4eb4-953f-552da9ab61e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"58526bd9-2f04-40ed-8fae-9097bedf6f26.jpg","Type":"Box - Front - Reconstructed","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"29ea2d46-c112-4dac-8bea-d8101f83c2c3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"da24e001-fbf7-47eb-8e78-13b57038d75a.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"ee0dc5b3-55f4-4ca0-95ac-1890d4432058.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133422,"FileName":"9e8a05b5-4a23-4ebd-9d72-a1a21641a523.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146083,"Name":"Buzzard Bait","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Buzzard Bait is a single screen shoot'em up where you have to protect the humans from predatory buzzards.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, three pair of buzzards each go into their nests to make sweet love. As soon as they reappear from the nest an egg also emerges, which quickly hatches. After the egg has hatched the parent buzzards swoop down to pick up humans to feed to their young.\n\nThe player must protect the humans by shooting the buzzards. When the buzzards manages to pick up a human and feed it to their baby, it will also leave the nest and join the hunt.

To avoid the low flying penguin, the player can jump across it which is tricky because then he can crash into a buzzard.\n\nAfter each round, there is a bonus round where the player can score an extra life. The player must move through a screen filled with penguins while collecting all three parts of the ship to gain an extra life. The penguins are harmless but bumping into them makes the player bounce around like a pinball. At the same time the player must avoid explosive mines which are left by a space ship that randomly appears.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Sirius Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":146083,"FileName":"b78947af-99df-4c18-89e2-bcc71536f52e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":146083,"FileName":"73b9cc35-e261-4fe1-9b4a-c7241ed6f79d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":125084,"Name":"California Games","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"California Games is a 1987 Epyx sports video game for many home computers and video game consoles.

The player navigates the hero through the top-down corridors and rooms of the castle. The main gameplay challenge lies in dealing with the guards who patrol the castle and will be alerted to any noise made by the player. It is possible to shoot the guards, but the ammunition in the game is scarce, and some guards are very hard to kill, so the preferred course of action is moving without being noticed. If the player surprises a guard with a gun drawn, the guard will surrender, and the player will be able to frisk him for valuable items.\n\nThe player should also search the treasure chests scattered across the castle. Some of them contain war plans, which are essential for winning the game; others have useful items, such as bullets, grenades, bulletproof vests, and guard uniforms. The uniforms can be worn for disguise; however, higher-ranked SS guards will be able to recognize the intruder. Chests might also contain food and beverage; imbibing alcohol will result in a temporary loss of aim and balance for the player character.\n\nThe game's sound effects include some of the earliest examples of digital voice samples. The guards would sometimes shout out short phrases in German in an attempt to stop the protagonist.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fgok9eHqO8","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter; Stealth","Developer":"Silas S.

He was once banished from our land, but now he has gained control of two castles and, it is rumored, captured a princess. An evil spell is now cast upon us, hiding us from the sun. We live in total darkness. Unless the power behind Grimnacht's evil curse is discovered and destroyed, perpetual night will be our lot.\" \n\nSo begins Castles of Darkness, an early graphic adventure game, written by Michael Cashen for the Apple II. Michael explains: \" Like a lot of small computer stores, back in those days, The Logical Choice had a meeting room where we fanatics gathered and discussed various problems. A big topic was how to maximize memory (64K RAM was huge then) and I figured out how to tap into the Apple II's graphics in ways I could get a lot of bang for the byte. Castles of Darkness grew out of those methods since I could now fit a lot of information on a 5\" floppy disk. George, the owner of The Logical Choice, contracted to publish it and had to talk me out of writing a casette version: I felt sorry for the many who had not yet graduated to floppy disks (most owners of the first Apple II's transferred information with a standard audio cassette - and my Apple II Plus was one of the first: it had the serial number 00109).\n\nThe game was written using a crude assembly language program written by Apple's Steve Wozniak and part of the deal was that I had to rewrite enough of Apple's DOS so that the major copy programs of the day couldn't copy it. \n\nThere was no particular inspiration to the game, except the general Tolkien inspiration that seemed to permeate a lot of the early adventures. I wrote a similar game called Enchanted Islands, but I stretched the limits of graphic compression to far which resulted in unacceptable graphics.

The game is similar to Caverns of Mars for the Atari 8-bit family.\n\nThe player controls a small craft, navigating it through a series of winding caverns and tunnels while shooting or avoiding obstacles. The caverns scroll from the bottom of the screen to the top at a fixed speed, so the player must always move forward.\n\nThe obstacles filling the tunnels are mostly the eponymous \"creatures\" and appear as simple icons like smiley faces, floppy diskettes, birds, eyes, apples, bunches of grapes, Pac-Man ghosts, baseball hats, turrets, etc. Many of these objects are animated, but they do not actually move about. The player's craft fires bolts of energy simultaneously in three directions (left, right and forward) that destroy the creatures but consume the ship's energy, tracked by a green bar at the bottom of the screen. Energy is replenished by shooting occasional \"tanks\" on the tunnel walls.\n\nSpecial objects in the caverns include indestructible Rubik's cube-like boxes that can be shot to gain extra points, indestructible wriggling snakes (one of the cavern's few mobile opponents), and pulsing energy barriers.\n\nThe craft is destroyed if it strikes any object or the cavern wall; a new one can be put back into play at any position on the screen. The game ends when the last craft is destroyed or when the player beats the final challenge. The game's introduction promises that \"the end battle will be a surprise that no one can miss.\"","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYVt62UfWVc","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Paul Lowrance","Publisher":"Datamost, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":134045,"FileName":"503b7886-58a6-4e34-b163-e83a10b0caaa.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134045,"FileName":"697cf45d-bd8f-4a4e-8f3b-fc8d57611037.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134045,"FileName":"c51e6619-bca7-4881-8e50-5d454334ca52.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134045,"FileName":"96ab5d7d-d8bb-41b2-9e71-04ed5db2b6a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134045,"FileName":"4d2b086d-92e5-43b4-8d27-556ff7d131c2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133427,"Name":"Caverns of Callisto","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"You are an astronaut on the moon of Callisto and mutants have stolen the panels from your spaceship along with its ion drive.

Armed with only a magic wand to ward off the forest's insect denizens, all of which apparently are attacking in the player in continuous waves. \n\nThe player must use the magic wand to shoot sparks at approaching insects to score points by pressing the controller button. Holding down the controller button will set the wand to rapid fire shots. If the player is bitten by an insect, the player will be temporarily paralyzed and lose one of the three starting magic wands. \n\nInsect Opponents and Mushrooms\nAll enemy insects have a distinctive sound before attacking, which may help the player identify which insect is attacking. Enemies and objects in the game are as the following:\nThe Centipede\nThe Centipede will attack in 12 waves. In the first wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 11 body segments. In the second wave, the Centipede will have a head attached to 10 body segments, in addition to a detached head. The third wave will have the Centipede with an attached head, 9 body segments, plus two detached heads. These body segments will transform into heads and continue to do so until Wave 12. In the last wave, the Centipede will have 12 detached heads, independently attacking the player. Centipede heads are worth more points than body segments.\n\nAttacks from the Centipede will come from the top of the screen, moving downward. If a spark hits any part of the Centipede, that particular body segment will transform into a mushroom, while the body segment behind it will become the new Centipede head. When the Centipede is destroyed, it will briefly disappear and re-appear from the top of the screen again.\n\nThe Spider\nThe Spider will attempt to distract the player from attacking the Centipede. It will destroy any mushroom it touches. Spiders will score more points if it is hit in closer distances.\n\nThe Flea\nThe Flea will appear if the player has destroyed most of the existing mushrooms. It will drop down creating a new batch of mushrooms where it falls. The Flea will disappear after two hits. After the first hit, the Flea will drop down much faster.\n\nThe Scorpion\nThe Scorpion will appear in the third wave. It moves slowly but will pick up speed, moving faster. While doing so, it will poison any mushroom it touches.\n\nMushrooms\nMushrooms fill the Enchanted Forest and may act as obstacles or cover for the player, with added effects to enemy insects. It takes four shots to completly destroy a mushroom. There are two types of mushrooms: Magic Mushrooms and Poisonous mushrooms. Magic mushrooms are the default mushrooms in the game and are also the result of the player destroying an insect or Centipede body segment. Poisonous Mushrooms are the result of the Scorpion touching a mushroom. Poisonous Mushrooms will prompt the Centipede near it to move straight towards the player through any mushroom. Losing a wand will restore any partially damaged mushroom.\n\nGame Difficulty and Variations\nThe game offers four difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Advanced, and Expert. Game Variations are as the following:\nOne Player\nTwo Player Alternating\nTwo players will take turns when the active player is bitten.\nDual Player Competition\nTwo players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is separate. Shots fired from one player will paralyze the other player.\nTeam Play Two players will appear on the screen at the same time. Scoring is combined. Shots fired from one player will not paralyze the other player.\n\nScoring\nThe player will win a bonus magic wand for every 12,000 points to a maximum of six wands. The game will end when all wands are lost. Scoring are as the following:\nCentipede Head - 100 points\nCentipede Body Segment - 10 points\nSpider at close range - 900 points\nSpider at medium range - 600 points\nFlea - 200 points\nScorpion - 1,000 points\nRestored mushroom - 5 points\nDestroyed mushroom - 1 points","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Atari, Inc.","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"d2b2ee44-3a62-4478-96dd-e1e9ed889da7.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"44f10178-0b8a-4b34-8546-8aa3015d686d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"de18182f-6ba0-4e9f-95d1-aa5977bd0932.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"b6429f95-eccb-405a-bec4-2f06b99e3a62.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"9e2a4c33-e742-4263-abd6-09f463e3b6ad.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"a45aaf3f-b3c5-449f-8e4a-92836f4a15a5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"b8ee1e6c-0366-4ba9-ac1e-2e3890fcbb49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"d5532008-41b1-4c7e-952c-a34f1c8f9813.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124990,"FileName":"895f5c3b-1d76-4bb7-a823-d0476a657be3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163899,"Name":"C'est La Vie","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Jacques needs to gather ten, twenty, and fifty dollar bills scattered around the streets of New York before time runs out.

Crashing into walls will cause Jacques to end up in a hospital for treatment and also cause him to get slapped with a $200 bill. After he makes enough money, he can deposit his cash safely into the bank. Alternatively, Jacques can buy or sell shares at Wall Street, but how much stock he gets depends on the current state of the stock market. If Jacques runs out of money, he can get a loan of up to $10,000, and he is given two months to pay back the loan. If Jacques fails to pay back the loan within two months, then the loan shark Ed will send one of his goons to seek Jacques out and relieve him of his cash, as well as put him in a hospital.

The game's box featured a painting of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the muscle-bound warrior with his new costume for Destroyer. Despite this attempted tie-in, the game has little to do with the movie series except that it features the Cimmerian in the title role. This is due to having originally been designed without the Conan tie-in, as a boomerang-throwing game titled Visigoth. One of the screenshots on the back of the packaging is from a prototype version, and shows a boomerang instead of a sword.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIFnnl9_CeQ","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"SE Software","Publisher":"Datasoft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"8feb1c48-0120-4fa9-bc70-dbdb938d65d2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"7e9e117c-3351-435f-a71f-40208ca4d1fe.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"8f51e1bf-6734-45fc-b83a-49f24e7c8519.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"d4c4cee3-ad9d-43b2-a6b8-ac5489f74e76.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"9a5aa1f0-cee2-4566-9f15-1db68cebb5c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"8825f1f4-9502-47d0-a8f4-35e7970add77.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"5017d37f-15e5-42bf-938f-42a815a63041.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"f2153425-f73d-4693-90d4-5a25b1ce1215.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"60c98555-e280-439e-a543-0bce8b24aa8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132246,"FileName":"9ceeeef9-a717-4aee-8d7a-760abce822e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":132246,"AlternateName":"Conan: Hall of Volta","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":134352,"Name":"Conflict 2500","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It is the year 2500 and the galaxy has been at peace for many years.

While the Prince was exploring the mountains of his newly conquered lands, his men came across a large cavern full of monsters. Deciding this monster home would be the ideal place to build his new capital, his men cleared the beasts from the caves, and called this their new home. Arthain hired elves and dwarves to deck the underground caverns in great splendor. Within 5 years, Arthain had married his betrothed Melora, and had two sons Berthain and Merthain.\n\nBerthain and Merthain were forever jealous of the other, always seeking what the other possessed. Their jealously eventually led to the deaths of the other's girlfriend. Outraged, Arthain banished each child to a fort on opposite ends of the far outskirts of his kingdom, never to step foot in the capital again. Arthain's had further sons, but they were to lose their lives in the various skirmishes the kingdom partook in. Finally, on his deathbed, in need of an heir, Athain wrote a letter to his two wayward sons. His crown lies within the halls of the mountain kingdom, and the son who can first retrieve it shall become king of the mountain kingdom.\n\nThe game allows for 2-player competitive play, or a single-player campaign. All input is via text commands. Played primarily on an overhead hexagonal grid, the two princes are separated by an impassable mountain range. The goal is to explore the countryside, gain power, and discover the clues to enter the underground halls of the abandoned capital. The player encounters enemies including: trolls, wights, ogres, goblins, and more. Combat occurs from a sideview, where player and monster take turns striking each other, while the health bar of each combatant drops. Health regenerates automatically while exploring the countryside. Players can choose from 20 difficulty levels, which effect the power of monsters they encounter.\n\nEach hexagon has a hidden treasure, which can be discovered by searching the area. The hexagon will contain either gold, magic armor or sword which will increase the player's attack or defense, cloaks which decrease enemy encounters, or copper amulets which increase health regeneration rate. There are 2 special encounters, a dwarf who teaches the player the location of the city entrance for 5000 gold, and an elf who gives the password to enter.\n\nUpon entering the capital, the player must search the halls for the crown, which is guarded by a fire breathing dragon. The visual display changes, and the player can only move in the 4 cardinal directions. Each turn, the player must select the direction and distance they must travel. After slaying the dragon, the player is victorious.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Micro Lab","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"e4ceda90-5d94-4b4a-8429-fd0ae2f91943.PNG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"5a417456-625f-405f-80c5-c0cef154b6c7.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"6df6f0b7-db7b-49fc-85fe-85aaff3ca83a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"84165f5e-408b-494a-becc-f4744fb71bcc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"0bbbac64-3161-49d4-9600-5a7a0357516d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"275320cc-1a65-46bb-84db-e2e1ed89b2c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"1c418f9d-1e29-440b-96bb-4a43eb68da5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163902,"FileName":"dec999da-f491-4f40-9ce4-43245b29a387.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134542,"Name":"Crusade in Europe","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The first of the Command Series of tactical wargames released by MicroProse in the mid-1980s, Crusade in Europe is the descendant of Meier's first wargame, NATO Commander.

In the game's two-player mode, players pit their characters against each other. Barbarian also has a single-player mode, in which the player's barbarian braves a series of challenges set by an evil wizard to rescue a princess.\n\nInstead of using painted artwork for the game's box, Palace Software used photos of hired models. The photos, also used in advertising campaigns, featured Michael Van Wijk (who would later become famous as 'Wolf' in the TV series Gladiators) as the hero and bikini-clad Maria Whittaker, a model who was then associated with The Sun tabloid's Page Three topless photo shoots. Palace Software's marketing strategy provoked controversy in the United Kingdom, with protests focused on the sexual aspects of the packaging rather than decapitations and other violence within the game. The ensuing controversy boosted Barbarian's profile, helping to make it a commercial success. Game critics were impressed with its fast and furious combat, and dashes of humour. The game was Palace Software's critical hit; boosted by Barbarian's success, Palace Software expanded its operations and started publishing other developers' work. In 1988, the company released a sequel, Barbarian II: The Dungeon of Drax.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prGFUoDOVZA","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Fighting","Developer":"Designer Software","Publisher":"Epyx, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1987-08-07T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":134606,"FileName":"311be090-4586-48b3-aaca-07e7bc9abfc6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134606,"FileName":"79b41730-7e81-4450-b8d3-bc31f0242e5c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134606,"FileName":"0cdffc9a-bed8-4864-910c-f670c2e1f108.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134606,"FileName":"995b6eef-21ca-4d9a-9990-a8ae19e07d07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134606,"FileName":"71b51649-9a08-47e0-8991-abddfb9c20a7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134607,"Name":"Deathlord","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Deathlord is a 1987 role-playing video game created by Al Escudero and David Wong.

A horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids.\n\nDefender was one of the most important titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Though not the first game to scroll horizontally, it created the genre of purely horizontal scrolling shooters. It inspired the development of other games and was followed by sequels and many imitations.\n\nThere were many ports to contemporary systems, most of them by either Atari, Inc. or its software label for non-Atari platforms, Atarisoft.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-yDQX2Kx-0","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Williams Electronics","Publisher":"Atarisoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"f3638458-3104-4667-8742-4b9fcaf503d3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"db01dbd9-cf6b-43aa-9410-b301951e3c5e.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"bd3ec5f7-1a56-4c86-a563-82457edf44b9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"8b7f065a-810d-428a-a17a-1af044f7aeef.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"82d0547e-0194-49dd-9c21-5aeaa9e4743f.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"f4a5b594-5311-4d0e-8d38-5b8d753ccf06.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134612,"FileName":"0dda132d-3354-4dee-8077-92c382e3e955.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":146114,"Name":"Dell Crossword Puzzles","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Dell Crossword Puzzles contains a number of crossword puzzles developed by Dell Magazine.\n\nContains a number of crossword puzzles of varying topics.

Deep within the craggy, mountainous area of Adventura, guarded by an army of fiercely competitive Orcan warriors, stands the ancient fortress of the once great and benevolent ruler, King Ecreip III.\n\nThe land that King Ecreip III ruled was grand and prosperous, rich in gems and blessed by good spirits. But the good King Ecrip III was a lonely man, for he had no Queen and no heirs. Shortly before his death, the King announced that he would allow his kingdom to be ruled by none other than the wisest and most courageous man in the land. That man, it was stated, must slay the feared Faldrakrin, the invincible red dragon that threatened Adventura with evil and doom.\n\nBut King Ecrip III died quickly and quietly, and no man had yet conquered the great red dragon. In fact, much to the chagrin of the folks of Adventura, Faldrakrin soon occupied the fortress of King Ecrip III and is shielded from its attackers by the mighty Orcan warriors.\n\nYour mission is to enter the land of Adventura and retrieve the kingdom that has been seized by the Orcans and deprived of the goodness and prosperity that the King Ecrip III strived to withhold. This mission is a complex and difficult one; it has been attempted by but one other man, Sir Marcos Dracos; he never returned...\n\nBe warned!

Unusual is that you do not control a single character, but rather a fighting force of 25 men -- who, effectively, represent your \"hit points\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xY7bZJ1LOQ","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Synergistic Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1978-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133915,"FileName":"587bd14f-70f9-4644-aa0c-3db4d5f78351.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":133915,"FileName":"e971450a-0285-4e8f-86a4-78cbcac95cab.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133915,"FileName":"d0db3c34-b438-4af7-9af4-24baa90b6c79.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133915,"FileName":"31ccf0e1-5a5c-4075-96e2-555873a28bcc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133915,"FileName":"aa1522e4-15c2-462f-acb7-a4bbd1f63b9c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133915,"FileName":"3eb7a86f-849d-416a-befa-f0c2ef59f8f9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":133915,"AlternateName":"Dungeon Campaign: Wilderness Campaign","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":175829,"Name":"Dungeon Master Assistant Vol. I: Encounters","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Designed as a tool to assist dungeon masters in the tabletop role-playing game, Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, this computer program features a database of over 1,000 distinct encounters and more than 1,300 monsters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"SSI (Strategic Simulations, Inc.)","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175829,"FileName":"f1881365-ef88-4639-ab71-16e8d7e83957.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":175829,"FileName":"456f2443-af87-4fd0-a37c-d7cf668f55a3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175829,"FileName":"25a6a5c2-5627-4b8d-aaa4-1aa27e7916f0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":175829,"FileName":"f78f6daf-3ba1-4058-8a61-4cf3f8066f2e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133916,"Name":"Dungeon!","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Dungeon! is a rogue-like RPG for 1 - 4 players.

Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.\n\nThe game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.\n\nElite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Firebird Licensees Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133495,"FileName":"369c0623-b023-4fa2-a2e3-618f01903c0c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133495,"FileName":"1e034d27-d599-4bd0-88fc-baa96a61cf28.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":133495,"FileName":"ae9eac21-8085-41e1-8ba0-eea0eb79c69a.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133495,"FileName":"f1d77e88-df12-457d-9013-5790a3cd7111.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134656,"Name":"Empire I: World Builders","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The gateway to the New York Rocket Field is your first step of a space voyage in which you may choose one of three career paths to follow, here at the dawn of the interstellar Empire.

More powerful spells can be found on scrolls hidden in various locations, but as the player becomes more of a threat, Krill will respond accordingly.\n\nThis game features an innovative new spell system based partially on Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea series and partially Dungeons and Dragons' Vancian spell system, where spells must be prepared through \"memorization\" before being cast. As in the Earthsea series, each spell is represented by some nonsense \"magic word\" which is treated as a verb by the game's text parser, so that one can use the FROTZ spell (which causes objects to glow and give off light) by typing FROTZ BOOK, in exactly the same way as one might type PICK UP BOOK or READ BOOK.\n\nThere are references scattered throughout Enchanter's documentation and gameplay comparing the use of spells by mages to the use of command line interfaces by programmers, and comparing mages to hackers in general. Many of the spell names, such as FROTZ and GNUSTO, are taken from MIT hacker slang of the time; others are various pop cultural references or anagrams. (For instance, the NITFOL spell allows one to speak with animals, and NITFOL is a truncated reversal of \"LOFTING\", after the author of the Doctor Dolittle stories.)","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133496,"FileName":"44510c9a-4433-4220-aefd-037dc988f95e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133496,"FileName":"1983b51b-8398-447d-9746-02b1b8f2e71d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133496,"FileName":"c2910c99-02ba-4cfb-b267-baee18b17314.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133496,"FileName":"cc4bf279-fc53-4842-b1fe-09961b94572d.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133496,"FileName":"7a81533d-22dd-49db-94e5-01027a02f846.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133917,"Name":"EOS: Earth Orbit Stations","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"E.O.S.: Earth Orbit Stations is 1987 a space station management simulation game developed by Karl Buiter and produced by Joe Ybarra for Electronic Arts.

These modes do not require the same level of knowledge.\n\nFlight Simulator II is packaged with a WWI dogfighting game, called WWI Ace. In this game the plane is armed with bombs, machine guns, and a radar screen. The radar screen is anachronistic for a game set in World War I, but it is there to make the gameplay easier.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK-iIrIEOyc","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Flight Simulator","Developer":"Sublogic","Publisher":"Sublogic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133500,"FileName":"3ee13148-9368-4f0a-8907-418041579231.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133500,"FileName":"a3258c30-1c03-4c58-a6a4-7fef503d9f52.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133500,"FileName":"ccccd29f-757d-41f6-80b4-9ee641a420db.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133500,"FileName":"c6b8d2a8-6527-4b80-9e6d-634e234de065.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133500,"FileName":"007bd8f3-cf08-4b9d-9353-5cb309ab99e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134882,"Name":"Flip Out","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Flip Out is a strategy puzzle game written by Scott Huskey and published by Sirius Software for the Apple II computers.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Sirius Software","Publisher":"Sirius Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1982-08-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":134882,"FileName":"536e0e5c-665e-4980-b5dd-7e362cd960bb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":134882,"FileName":"84e784a1-0288-4747-a227-eb6516e2048f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134882,"FileName":"a7fe03c7-6726-41ec-a881-71ff385a6351.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134882,"FileName":"6e6cc696-8808-4449-a3e0-553518edc64e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163888,"Name":"Flockland Island Crisis","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Flockland Island Crisis is a shoot 'em up where the player has to defend a long and narrow island which runs from the top to the bottom of the screen.

They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated \"proton packs\" and \"ghost traps\", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the \"PK level\" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for \"ghost alarms\", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuFvo9Vn-XQ","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"David Crane","Publisher":"Activision, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1984-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133511,"FileName":"48e61856-5213-4880-af1f-37d893f3e420.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133511,"FileName":"1545db45-1ebb-4844-97bd-a9a636750f26.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133511,"FileName":"be7d4ccc-1fa5-45e2-acd5-ce542db338e1.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133511,"FileName":"da78673b-e844-4e33-8328-8effeab8f0c8.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133511,"FileName":"f88250fe-42e8-470d-8e6c-a2b1fe1ac699.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133511,"FileName":"f93b386d-f420-4968-817b-d33bd66c1807.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":184848,"Name":"Giant World","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"A graphical text adventure, where the player inputs commands via VERB NOUN text entry.

Wind also plays a part in the simulation. St. Andrews is a very windy course.\n\nThe game's display provides all the information required to make a great shot. Each hole provides an overhead and side view. Wind on the course is displayed by an arrow at the bottom of the screen which points in the direction in which the wind is blowing and that your ball will tend to blow. The larger the arrow, the harder the wind is blowing. It also shows you where the ball is, how far you are from the pin, what surface you are on and what stroke you are about to hit.\n\nUp to 4 players can play at a time. Enter your name. Select what type of tees that you wish to play from, Medal or Championship. Once selected, they will remain the same throughout the entire round. Choose the starting hole. Pressing the Enter key without specifying the hole will start you on the first hole. You are allowed to carry 14 clubs. One must be a putter. The club selection screen also gives you the prevailing wind speed and direction. This allows you to choose the correct clubs for the conditions. After choosing your club (C), choose how hard to swing (F). Force of stroke depends on the club used. Irons and Woods choices are full, three-quarters, half or quarter swings. Wedges and putter, you enter the force as a number representing the number of feet. Your choices will be displayed. Specify what direction to hit the ball (D) and whether to hook or slice (S).

To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras.

A pedagogic device without parallel in the annals of digitized\nsports games. An electronic derby party which fetes more equine excitement than my own loquacious platitudes and perambulations in covering the May Classic (the Kentucky Derby for the uninitiated) in my own nasal and lugubrious fashion.\n\nThank you Howard for that nifty introduction to HORSE RACING CLASSIC. Yes, we agree with you, HRC is a good horse racing simulation, a good teaching tool, and just a darn good party game. There have been several horse race games written for the Apple (most were little more than lo-res programming exercises), but HRC stands apart.\n\n As a simulation, HRC makes use of a horse's track record to determine the potential performance of each horse on the daily card. For example, a horse that has a record of coming from off the pace (according to the racing form provided for each race) will have a good chance of closing on the leaders in any given race. Anyone who knows how to read a racing form will feel very comfortable with HRC, as the two most recent performances of each horse in a race are given for your examination. In addition to the recent racing history of each horse and standard racing form data (weight carried, Odds, fastest time, number of starts, wins, places, and shows), HRC gives a rating to the jockey and trainer assigned to each horse. All of which adds an amazing degree of realism to the game.\n\nAs a tutorial, HRC can be used to teach a novice not only how to read the racing form, but how to make\nintelligent choices at the betting window. When is it best to bet across the board? Is there really any logic to \"Place\" bet? How did I lose my money so easily? The appendix to the rulebook has a nice little discussion\non understanding odds and pay-offs. \n\nWhile HRC performs admirably as a simulation and tutorial on thoroughbred wagering it really shines as a party game. With HRC at a party, don't be surprised if you find a room full of otherwise normal people jumping up and down screaming for \"Spectacular Bid\" (or even \"Spectacular Dud\") to race across those last few grueling inches of the monitor for a well earned victory. As we have just hinted, you can change the name of any of the 100 horses stored on the game disk. This will not change the horses performance\nrecord (which is stored by date and race), but can provide a humorous touch to the proceedings. Each bettor is given an initial stake of $100 which he or she uses to try and win the most money. The game\nstores the ten highest winning totals on disk. This \"Handicapper Hall Of Fame\" adds an additional touch to\nthe game, evidenced by a recent incident in which a player refused to bet on the last 4 races of the daily\ncard because he had a $1 lead over the all-time third place total. \n\nFrom one to nine bettors can buy the traditional win, place, and show tickets for any of seven horses in the four to nine races of the daily card race. Bettors can also buy tickets in any combinations such as betting a horse \"across the board\". This hi-res game is very well done and well worth the $36.95 price tag.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Tazumi Software International","Publisher":"Tazumi Software International","ReleaseDate":"1982-08-18T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135081,"FileName":"842aa0ba-4eac-4cb5-b858-d8f6c86f98e6.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":135081,"FileName":"ce97821d-def8-4c05-a586-7ff76164fb54.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135081,"FileName":"7804d284-239b-4fde-a539-bd52ac4f29ab.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135085,"Name":"I, Damiano","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An interactive fiction game based on a Bantam fantasy novel by R.A.

To that end, it includes a series of drills to practice the four different strategies, arranged by skill level. Computer-controlled players can be set to use any of these strategies during a game.

A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.\n\nDepending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.\n\nYou can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.\n\nThere are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.\n\nAs for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYFayBTkqa8","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132695,"FileName":"dd9f4598-35f1-4e44-a3a3-29544cd5ecc6.JPG","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132695,"FileName":"81e8021b-6c3e-41b7-938b-fec17f4659d1.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132695,"FileName":"62c07076-da86-4080-bb5f-31ee29aeccee.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132695,"FileName":"06351fff-cbb1-42b9-8475-9e4132d14042.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132695,"FileName":"6d0b023c-2cae-40b6-a7de-8fd5bec120e8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132695,"FileName":"67779adb-1a2a-430c-90a4-397e1ba4b620.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133681,"Name":"King's Quest","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"King's Quest is commonly considered the progenitor of third-person-perspective adventure games.

Their adventure system has been upgraded before, but this time it has been upgraded beyond recognition. So too have their graphics. Gone are the rather rudimentary and meaningless ‘representations’ replaced by ‘digitised’ pictures. Amiga owners get the best of the deal here, for there is more colour per picture on that machine than the others – including the Atari ST. But it is the mode of play that has changed most dramatically. No longer do you have to make a map, and slavishly follow it move by move to return to a place you have visited earlier. No longer do you have to remember where you dropped an object that you may need later. All that is required is that you know which object you need, or which location you want to reach. If that makes playing Knight Orc sound dead simple, then forget it! To offset the ease of operation, the adventure is endowed with more than its fair share of independent characters, with minds of their own, who get in your way, grabbing the very item you are looking for, and attack you with relentless determination. Having spent many hours playing this game I must admit that I didn’t actually finish it: I’m not sure that I want to finish wandering about this strange new world inside my Amiga.

A cassette version was also released for the Commodore 64.[2] The Atari version required computers with the GTIA chip installed in order to display properly.\n\nKoronis Rift was one of two games in Lucasfilm Games' second wave (December 1985). The other was The Eidolon. Both enhanced the fractal technology developed for Rescue on Fractalus!. In Koronis Rift, the Atari 8-bit family's additional colors (over those of the Commodore 64) allowed the programmers to gradually fade in the background rather than it suddenly popping in as in Rescue, an early example of depth cueing in a computer game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Lucasfilm Games","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135148,"FileName":"8f7a8bcf-dc48-45bd-a4af-925258f76bc5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135148,"FileName":"b29db009-bff9-4a35-b053-f48c4e207fc0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135148,"FileName":"3c10e79e-f7d6-4445-a00f-1a8c0ea5ae1f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135148,"FileName":"81d740b1-550a-4f4b-bad1-ee1e092669cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135149,"Name":"Kukulcan","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"An educational graphic adventure set in 1519, during the time of the Aztecs.

It was one of Accolade's launch products and is the only game in Accolade's history to be designed by Accolade co-founder Alan Miller. Graphics were by Mimi Doggett and the music was by Ed Bogas.  The game is a kind of graphical adventure game taking place in the American Old West. In Scandinavia the game was published by American Action.\n\nThe entirety of the game happens in a small frontier town, and the player takes the role of the town's Sheriff. The scenes are located along the town's main street, with a view from behind the Sheriff's back (the view is so close that only the Sheriff's waist, right arm and gun are visible). Various other characters appear on the main street in front of the Sheriff.\n\nThe actual gameplay mostly concerns the Sheriff discussing with the various characters via a selection menu similar to those in contemporary graphical adventures. For each line the other character says, the game offers a selection of four different responses, and the discussion progresses depending on the chosen response. Law of the West marks the first use of this now-common interaction style.\n\nDepending on the outcome of a discussion, the Sheriff may get involved in a gunfight. In this case, the gameplay becomes a pure test of shooting skills, as the Sheriff has to shoot his opponent before getting shot himself. Gunplay is accomplished by pushing up on the joystick to draw the weapon, which causes a joystick-controlled crosshairs to appear on the screen. The various characters would react if the Sheriff drew his gun before they had a chance to say their opening line, usually refusing to speak until the gun was put away.\n\nIf the Sheriff gets shot, he blacks out, and the doctor is called to help. Depending on the Sheriff's previous interaction with the doctor and the other characters in the game (and if the doctor's in town), he may either be healed, or left for dead (either by the doctor refusing to help, or the doctor being drunk at the time). The only goal of the game is for the player to make it alive to the end of the day; if the player wishes he can gun down every character he meets without talking to them albeit this will be reflected negatively in the final score.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Accolade","Publisher":"Accolade","ReleaseDate":"1985-08-19T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135156,"FileName":"66e18e8d-e81f-435c-8c78-4dbd90fe3a46.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135156,"FileName":"0999ba78-44f8-4205-a4ee-70f2e4f1b663.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135156,"FileName":"d153ab1e-276e-4309-832a-2d6840442c8b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135156,"FileName":"b30ffc9d-8a69-4cbd-af28-aeed335d04b3.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135156,"FileName":"780f2eb6-2ddd-47d0-b1fe-48d9ad534e6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175855,"Name":"Lazer Maze","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Lazer Maze is a strategy game based upon predicting the output of a laser fired into a room with multiple mirrors.\n\nThe game board consists of a room in a 10 x 10 grid, which is filled with a number of angled mirrors.

It utilizes the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) engine made famous by King's Quest: Quest for the Crown.\n\nThe game's story follows a middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer as he desperately tries to \"get lucky\" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages.

Sierra developed and published a remake that used the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine with 256 colors and a point-and-click, icon-driven (as opposed to text-based) user interface, released for the PC DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Amiga in 1991.

Before that can be done the group must explore nine chateaux each of which contains a problem and clues that are useful later in the game, battle assorted and unusual monsters, enter villages to trade, and develop your characters skills.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Infogrames","ReleaseDate":"1985-05-08T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165355,"FileName":"82e841da-0196-4582-a645-91234a9cc066.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":165355,"FileName":"cc642e19-c217-4964-bf9f-4635740d5a39.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165355,"FileName":"eff0b044-bbbd-4a50-8608-08af5d0319a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165355,"FileName":"2cc0e205-406e-4eaa-b9c1-3811c1ad184b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165355,"FileName":"9716b71e-f087-4f08-b60b-d8a167b624d2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135289,"Name":"Manhunter: New York","ReleaseYear":"2017","Overview":"Manhunter: New York is a post-apocalyptic adventure game designed by Barry Murry, Dave Murry and Dee Dee Murry of Evryware and published in 1988 by Sierra On-Line.

The Orbs, who look like giant floating eyeballs, have implanted all humans with global tracking devices, forced them to wear nondescript robes and forbid them from speaking or communicating. The protagonist has been assigned by the Orbs to track down fellow humans who are believed to be forming an underground resistance. Over the course of the game, the player discovers that the Orbs are not the benevolent rulers they claim to be; they are actually harvesting humans as a food source.

Three chances per problem are given to answer correctly. Once again, there are encouraging messages and animations- and a certificate of achievement may be printed out.\n\nOrbit- three problems appear on-screen with portions of each in boxes; these boxes may contain errors and need to be changed by the player. Each correct answer earns a star, and the player can attempt to answer twice. This one also can print a certificate of achievement.\n\nBlasternaut- the action-oriented math activity- you control a Blasternaut that must get into a rocket aimed at the correct answer to a shown problem. Bonus points are awarded if you can rescue floating Blasternauts- apparently slamming into them with the nosecone of a huge rocket constitutes help.\n\nThe math problems contained within aren't randomly generated, but are pre-written lessons (which are handily printed in the instruction manuals.)

Before long the heroes realize that one of the four kings that rule the countries of Varn is in fact an impostor, a creature from outer space. Their task is to find the real king and ultimately stop the mysterious space traveler, revealing the truth about the world's origin in the process.\n\nThe Secret of the Inner Sanctum is a role-playing game and the first installment in the Might and Magic series. Core gameplay concept is similar to that of Wizardry games, though the game does not focus solely on dungeon crawling and features overworld areas and towns that can be physically navigated. In this way the game resembles The Bard's Tale, though it has a significantly larger playing environment with several towns. The entire game is viewed from first-person perspective, and the game environment consists of maze-like passages made with pseudo-3D graphics.\n\nIn the beginning of the game, the player creates a party of six adventurers. There are six classes to choose from: knight, robber, sorcerer, cleric, paladin, and archer. Each character has six main attributes: might, endurance, accuracy, personality, intelligence, and luck, with each class requires proficiency in a specific attribute for effective functioning. There are also five races to choose from: humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs.\n\nAs in most RPGs, the gameplay revolves around exploring the game world and leveling up to be able to proceed to the story-advancing challenges. The party starts in a particularly weak state, equipped with only clubs and having no money. The player is free to explore most of the game's locations in any order, and there are few hints as to what needs to be done to advance the plot. Turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies typically take place against a group of monsters more or less equal in size to the player-controlled party, but enemy reinforcements can appear once their comrades have been slain. It is also possible to try and bribe enemies or surrender to them before entering combat.\n\nThe game has no auto-mapping feature of any kind and it is only possible to save the player's progress at inns located in towns.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0airoGX9xk","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"New World Computing, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"db6b3947-3466-4022-852d-f058c8bb2ce8.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"12d6178b-a936-444d-bf36-006366d36269.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"bb576b7c-6562-4bf4-a583-fa2f7da91b96.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"089421d7-b477-4243-a6c8-8e6c54ab7daf.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"1ad10148-d929-4436-af5f-6fbe17238454.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"b8172ee4-3e37-4399-9196-778cfbc18ec3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132085,"FileName":"e8030c0d-5320-497d-85c4-313596ccd9f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":132085,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":132086,"Name":"Might and Magic II","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun. \n\nGates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TEz9KlDaZY","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing","Publisher":"New World Computing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"6037a4ee-dbf0-4a7f-9323-449bc4e482bd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"1dca499f-f0e2-4e7e-abfb-0cd549529994.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"bbb01ef4-2efc-41a4-8490-646dc1973de5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"159f55b8-397e-4a7a-b631-940849285051.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"41f479ee-a31b-42ad-8861-bafb7222638c.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"731fe9b6-896b-4933-8da2-5d5cb7ab9074.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132086,"FileName":"dc63cb09-d062-4aed-8732-800299baaa6a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":132086,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132086,"AlternateName":"Might and Magic Book Two: Gates to Another World","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":133509,"Name":"Millionaire: The Stock Market Simulation","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"In the game you are starting a session at the U.S. stock market with a beginning net worth equal to $10,000.

The game is played on a map of the United States and the player has access to ten missile sites that are used to defend the same number of cities. As enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) appear in the sky, the player launches an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) by pressing the number of one of the sites and steers it towards the target before hitting the space bar to detonate it when it is within range.\n\nEach site has a limited amount of missiles but these are replenished between waves as long as its connected city has not been destroyed. A non-damaged city produces five ABMs for its site while one that has take one hit builds two. A city is totally destroyed when it has taken two hits and will not produce any more missiles but the site will still be able to launch those that are in its stockpile. A site that is hit will lose its entire stockpile. Cities that have taken only one hit will repair themselves between waves. On later levels a defensive MX site is available. It can be moved on a fixed roadway and is not dependent on a city. It is restocked from along its movement path and due to its mobility it can not be hit. There is also a nuclear submarine that works similarily but that is restricted to the Carribean.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQdcOTATZU","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Western MicroData Enterprises Ltd.","Publisher":"Western MicroData Enterprises Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1981-02-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":145582,"FileName":"7a670a47-098c-41c7-9803-2c33cca24ece.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145582,"FileName":"7f239de8-dd11-4193-a4c4-5adb3d82b005.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145582,"FileName":"cab8aabc-fcd7-4aff-b0f2-5336bfb94a7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145582,"FileName":"890554f6-7761-4fa3-b9eb-704c7136cc7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145582,"FileName":"21989667-4445-4eee-b850-106893b0d88d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":145582,"FileName":"992b157d-8b5f-495a-a072-13cde16e4f6c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133411,"Name":"Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Nord and Bert Couldn't Make Head or Tail of It is an interactive fiction computer game written by Jeff O'Neill and published by Infocom in 1987.

Nord and Bert was unique among Infocom games in that it was highly surrealistic, centering on word play and puns. It is Infocom's twenty-seventh game.\n\nNord and Bert defies easy description, and in fact almost seems to have been created in an effort to be as strange as possible. For example, the title and front box illustration (two farmers staring at an animal that consists of two cows' rear halves fused together) have nothing to do with the game. Rather, Nord and Bert revolves around several different kinds of wordplay, with a \"chapter\" of the game dedicated to each style. The first seven chapters can be played in any order, since each exists as an independent \"short story\" unrelated to the other chapters; to begin the eighth, however, the player must provide seven \"passwords\" provided by completing each of the other sections.\n\nThe only effort made to interlink the separate parts of the game is as follows: reality has somehow been altered around the town of Punster.

There were many other additional features, such as electronic warfare, missile attacks, and the ability to conduct multiple paratroop drops.

Oil Barons was thus much like a numerically complex board game, in which the computer kept track of the numerous variables. The game could be played in any one of several modes, and with from one to eight players. Unfortunately, the fact this game has been out-of-print since the mid-1980s, and thus very few people today have an Oil Barons game board and tokens (particularly in light of the fact that only a very small number of copies were sold when it was in publication), potentially limits the game's appeal in contemporary times.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Epyx","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseDate":"1983-08-25T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135389,"FileName":"212ade5e-5157-4100-b731-c8b9fb64f787.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":135389,"FileName":"11946e82-db5b-4c57-8979-1a7ca0612a1d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":135389,"FileName":"71a153fd-242f-4ee7-96fc-6619e64149f8.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135389,"FileName":"353d315a-3f4b-47ab-ac00-b47b767345eb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135412,"Name":"Oil's Well","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Oil's Well is a computer game distributed by Sierra On-Line in 1983, and again in 1990.

In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.\n\nThe game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.\n\nThe next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.\n\nAfter escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.\n\nFinally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Rg3OBHISWI","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Quicksilver Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Data East Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133347,"FileName":"305faad8-3cb7-4305-8bef-19d70a8bc72a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133347,"FileName":"f7bb45e3-cf36-4e71-9073-fb7a45dc244a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133347,"FileName":"d43abb5a-0d59-47d3-a5b4-14edecf4f18f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133347,"FileName":"6c38434d-8ca9-43b6-9fd9-a0ab0af448d0.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133347,"FileName":"3f226462-cc4e-462a-a04f-f9dd86a0ce74.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133347,"FileName":"3b3c3aea-1450-4147-b924-d21177ae39bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176089,"Name":"Pleins Gaz","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This color HGR arcade game was released by Froggy Software in late 1986.

Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.\n\nPrince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.\n\nThe protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.\n\nThe Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fggouSd3dr4","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Broderbund","Publisher":"Broderbund","ReleaseDate":"1989-10-03T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"2e7c283d-d236-4a54-b17e-935f6ad72064.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"90b69374-20d2-4ca2-a1fa-d1801dc0ed4e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"f2b7f08f-da56-4673-a9e2-3b4d7e34a430.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"bd041d5f-a369-442b-b923-74573544eff6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"fdde8bc6-c02a-4e53-bcd6-97c9b2e44594.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"5f004ddd-e3a2-4c8e-b1b8-a86cfe13391e.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"3cd5b682-b267-4870-8315-7c2767e3183b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132711,"FileName":"13d9c398-9d91-4983-98e0-f702aed7eee0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166273,"Name":"Prism","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Prism is an ISM Storydisk which tells the wonderous tale of the theft of the three ancient Keys of Color,m and the adventures of the young boy who must seek them in the monstrous kingdom of Yolsva, Plane of Darkness.

In the first Questron game, the player takes on the role of a young serf who tries to make a name for himself by traveling the realm in order to gain the power and experience necessary to defeat the wicked \"Mantor\", ruler of the \"Land of Evil\".\n\nThe view is mostly in top-down style for the world maps and town encounters, but switches to a 3D first-person style in the dungeons of the Land of Evil. Some features were novel for a game of its type at the time of its release. First there are two \"games within a game\" that allow the character to permanently increase dexterity or intelligence attributes if completed successfully. Also, various casinos about the towns allow the player to gamble for gold pieces in games of blackjack, roulette and double or nothing.\n\nThe moral tone of the game is unusual. You can rob and kill merchants, and to progress in the game to the Land of Evil you must storm a castle and kill the guards. The king of that castle will knight you for your courage.\n\nAnother aspect of the game is that various monsters and foes are immune or more vulnerable to different weapons. The player would occasionally have to switch weapons depending on which enemy they faced in order to defeat them. Magic spells can also be cast, but only in the dungeon levels.\n\nThe original game was written by Charles Dougherty and Gerald Wieczorek and published in 1984 for the Atari 800, Commodore 64, and Apple II computer systems. After an out-of-court settlement, the structure and style of the game were both officially licensed from Richard Garriott, author of Akalabeth and Ultima.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAQSTlKKqRY","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Strategic Simultions Inc.","Publisher":"Strategic Simulations, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":135506,"FileName":"a82e1ab1-77c8-4e5b-8a55-8cc4346c9972.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135506,"FileName":"1442fecf-1159-4080-8152-937bbe62afe6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135506,"FileName":"945f34ab-5be3-47cd-9b81-9f81f6101f8b.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135506,"FileName":"93394f3c-4349-4131-b4a0-46c0c600ea88.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135507,"Name":"Questron II","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The premise of this game is that the player's character has been sent back in time to defeat six \"Mad Sorcerers\" before they can create the \"Book of Magic\" featured in the original game. \n\nAs the second title in the Questron series, this game follows the same basic formula as the original.

In each round of the game, eight names, places, or objects will appear on the screen that will be associated in some way. Out of the eight items, two to six will not be related to the others. The player needs to identify which item(s) are loners and remove them from the list in the given time limit. For each wrong guess the player will lose a life; if three lives are lost, the game ends. Points are awarded for correctly identifying loners; each round contains a goal score, so even if the player completes a round without losing all three lives the goal still needs to be met to proceed onto the next round.\n\nIn addition to the regular gameplay rounds, there are also two types of challenge rounds: the single loner challenge, and the matchmaker challenge. In the single loner challenge there will be only one loner in the set; the goal is to identify it as quickly as possible. A correct choice earns bonus points, or the round ends when an incorrect selection is made or time runs out. In the matchmaker challenge, there are nine items displayed; the player needs to find out which item matches the one displayed in the center of the board. Correct choices earn bonus points.\n\nQuink includes several subject areas, each of which have numerous categories that items may be associated by. The categories are:\n\n    Fame - includes categories such as Real Names of Movie Stars, Famous Generals, Leaders of Nations, TV Sportscasters, Sci-Fi Writers, and more.\n    Pop Culture - includes Dances, Monopoly Avenues, Toys, Mixed Drinks, TV Westerns, Airlines, and more.\n    Imagination - includes Music Terms, Onomatopoeia, Operas, Theft Talk, Poetic License, Bookish Things, Cartoon Curses, and more.\n    Science and Nature - includes Computer Lingo, Diseases, Vegetables, Knots, Birds, Metals, Parts of a Cell, and more.\n    General Knowledge - Seas, Cheeses, Martial Arts Forms, National Parks, Longest Rivers, Ancient Greeks, and more.\n    Mixed Bag - All of the above subject areas are included at the same time.\n\nThe game includes several gameplay options which adjust the difficulty and time limits. There is also an advanced play mode; in this mode the player must indicate when all loners have been removed instead of the game indicating such automatically.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle; Quiz; Education","Developer":"Ron Dubren and Associates","Publisher":"Thunder Mountain","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":165665,"FileName":"7eedd4ff-8c77-46d9-94bd-73637d4f8197.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":165665,"FileName":"5fde133e-388d-47b3-8e48-831081190825.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165665,"FileName":"b9f7903d-9e59-4af7-a307-5a10930c60f6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165665,"FileName":"e9bb5e4a-4522-43a6-9443-3df9cff86053.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165665,"FileName":"f3dd5219-f398-4c4e-86e2-b54087532c5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165665,"FileName":"fbf08320-cfb8-4a14-b2d1-8fc72a769a3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163835,"Name":"Race for Midnight","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"You live in a small village in 14th century Europe.

The game is not as fun as Davidson's other games-- perhaps because the company is better at designing games for older kids than toddlers. Still, the lack of variety in the game is compensated by the fact that there are few good reading programs in the market.\n\nReading and Me provides four games or groups of activities: kids will learn how to match upper and lower case letters, match initial letters with pictures of objects, and place appropriate words into sentences. The last game, tell the difference, does not so much teach reading as perception: kids are asked to pick out an item on screen that is different from the rest.\n\nAlthough the games in Reading and Me are well designed, the examples within each game lack variety, and the games become a little too repetitive. Kids who get to know the examples may quickly and tend to lose interest at this point. Although designed for young kids, Reading and Me is best played with an adult on their side, as some controls are difficult for kids to do and some sentences too difficult to read. Overall, it's not a bad effort, but it doesn't have the same stellar quality as the Math Blaster series. Pleasant graphics and decent speech support make it worth a look, however.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Education","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Davidson & Associates","ReleaseDate":"1988-05-17T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":165637,"FileName":"1e075afe-f48d-4000-8e19-0472d5a22f7c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":165637,"FileName":"6dd85f33-aa85-4399-bc57-83dc6103f15a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":165637,"FileName":"230c91e0-93d6-4fd7-af6f-a752758b3d5c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":166311,"Name":"Real Life","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Real Life: The Greatest Adventure of All, an \"interactive novel\" by Relational Systems Corporation, is billed as a simulation of life, to help you figure out where you're going, or perhaps how to avoid getting there. \n\nThe game features a split-screen setup: on the left, descriptions are given and commands are entered.

It was designed by Arthur Britto and Greg Hale.  The game is played on a two-dimensional side-scrolling gamefield, where two players start at main bases on opposing sides of the field. The player operates a Choplifter-esque helicopter defending a string of advancing units, which the player purchases throughout the game. The objective is to create and defend a force that can escort a van filled with explosives to the enemy base at the other end of the playing field.\n\nAlong the way a series of smaller bunkers act as obstacles by flying balloons which, when operating for the opposing team, will destroy the player helicopter (the cable will severely damage the helicopter). The bunkers may be taken over by delivering enough infantry units, which may reach the bunker either by walking all the way from a main base without being killed, or by being carried there more quickly in the player helicopter.\n\nThe helicopter begins with three weapons: heat-seeking missiles, machine guns, and bombs. As the game progresses, additional weaponry is introduced.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8_XsRYTO-0","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","Publisher":"Sir-tech Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1984-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135524,"FileName":"48cb75a4-4b90-42a8-9de9-b62f40ba08d3.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135524,"FileName":"1c360006-c8bb-44a0-8b01-0d32058cf954.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135524,"FileName":"e1d808d2-8e46-42c0-a077-d66ef80d3a1f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135524,"FileName":"f9689829-f849-4aee-b5a1-a40cbc7daa59.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":135524,"FileName":"5ea1e676-edad-41d2-a9ca-8afdcdb98225.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135524,"FileName":"2cf1f5f2-827f-4590-bd67-afc852a0686f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":135541,"Name":"Return of Heracles","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Return of Heracles is an adventure game for the Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64 and Apple II computers, originally written by Stuart Smith and published by Quality Software in 1983.

Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion.

This game, along with the companion program RobotWrite, was originally developed in the TUTOR programming language on the PLATO system in the 1970s. Later the game was commercialized and adapted for the Apple II family of computers and published by Muse Software in 1981. The premise was that in the distant future of 2002, war was declared hazardous to human health, and now countries settled their differences in a battle arena full of combat robots. As the manual stated, \"The task set before you is to program a robot that no other robot can destroy!\"\n\nThe main activity of the game was to write a computer program that would operate a (simulated) robot. The player could then select multiple robots who would do battle in an arena until only one was left standing. The robots did not have direct knowledge of the location or velocity of any of the other robots; they could only use radar pulses to deduce distance, and perhaps use clever programming techniques to deduce velocity. No physical dexterity was required or even relevant in RobotWar; there was no way for the player to actually take part in the battle.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Muse Games","Publisher":"Muse Games","ReleaseDate":"1981-08-27T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":135528,"FileName":"c47b5e0e-0663-43bd-ba88-6204f81822a5.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":135528,"FileName":"ec064730-c2b1-4035-b51e-186e3ff6af33.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135528,"FileName":"4539e59c-aea6-4705-aa9f-795a44af7e7c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135528,"FileName":"a24f54a0-04e9-4c56-bc6a-783254a14e97.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":163841,"Name":"Rocky's Boots","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Rocky's Boots is an educational logic puzzle game by Warren Robinett and Leslie Grimm, published by The Learning Company in 1982.

The game is for two players who share the same screen to move around their characters. The characters are bizlings, space travellers who have crash landed on Planet Simian. The crash has caused damage to the ship's paint shield and before they can leave they need to acquire paint.\n\nTo buy the needed paint it is first necessary to make some money. This is done by producing and selling synannas (synthetic bananas) to the Simian population. First the players have to acquire a raw material called ruf which is done by moving the bizling to one of the six rufhouses located on the screen. Each rufhouse has its own price which indicates its quality. After entering a rufhouse the player can wait for the price to drop but there is a risk that the seller will decide to not sell. After buying the rufs they can be brought to the space ship and manufactured into synannas which the Simians then will pick up and pay for. Sometimes it's necessary to advertise which is done by turning on a sign.\n\nThe price is set at $40 when starting out but after each week the player can set their own prices. At the end of each week the players will get information in the form of graphs on how they are doing. The players also get access to a prediction machine which can be used to see what might happen with the profits in the coming week. Awards are then given to the player that gets closest to the predictions made.\n\nPaint can be bought from a scientist that moves around in a paint van. When it stops there will be an auction for each bucket of paint with the highest bidder getting it. The player that buys the paint can then begin painting the shield. After every two weeks it is possible to attempt a launch of the space ship.

The score never drops below zero.\n\nThe game ends when the player's turret is hit by a bomb, when a single paratrooper lands directly on the turret base, when three paratroopers safely land atop each other immediately adjacent to the turret base (allowing the third to jump onto the base), or when four paratroopers safely land on either the left or right of the turret (that is four on one side, not four total). If four land on a side, they are able to build a human pyramid and climb up to the turret and blow it up once the sky is clear.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"On-Line Systems","Publisher":"On-Line Systems","ReleaseDate":"1981-09-09T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136225,"FileName":"fb9bb5e2-327f-43cb-810e-a22a541010e6.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136225,"FileName":"a40cbc97-73f1-4db5-a0d7-d8ebe933d575.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136225,"FileName":"c99b0c50-2f81-484c-9153-fa366cf12b3c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136225,"FileName":"99a1155a-6f85-402c-8b86-01d1330a16be.png","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136225,"FileName":"da7963f6-3a81-47af-b03d-73fe79416327.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136226,"Name":"Sammy Lightfoot","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Go through three levels jumping over obstacles that get in your way.

This concludes this two part ADVENTURE it requires you have completed #10 and received the password to start #11.\n\nAN OVERVIEW\n\nI stood at the bottom of a deep chasm. Cool air sliding down the sides of the crevasse hit waves of heat rising from a stream of bubbling lava and formed a mist over the sluggish flow. Through the swirling clouds I caught glimpses of two ledges high above me: one was bricked, the other appeared to lead to the throne room I have been seeking.\nA blast of fresh air cleared the mist near my feet and like a single gravestone a broken sign appeared momentarily. A dull gleam of gold showed at the base of the sign before being swallowed up by the log again. From the distance came the angry buzz of the killer bees. Could I avoid their lethal stings as I had managed to escape the wrath of the dragon? Reading the sign might give me a clue to the dangers of this pit.\nI approached the sign slowly.\nAnd so it goes - hour after hour, as you guide your microcomputer through the Adventures of Scott Adams in an effort to amass treasures within the worlds of his imagination.\nBy definition, an adventure is a dangerous or risky undertaking; a novel, exciting, or otherwise remarkable event or experience. On your personal computer, Adventure is that and more.\nFor the user, playing Adventure is a dangerous or risky undertaking in that you better be prepared to spend many addictive hours at the keyboard. If you like challenges, surprises, humor and being transported to other worlds, these are the games for you. If you dislike being forced to use your common sense and imagination, or you frustrate easily, try them anyway.\nIn beginning any Adventure, you will find yourself in a specific location: a forest, on board a small spaceship, outside a fun house, in the briefing room of a nuclear plant, in a desert, etc.\nby using two-word commands you move from location to location, manipulate objects that you find in the different places, and perform actions as if you were really there. The object of a game is to amass treasure for points or accomplish some other goal. Successfully completing a game, however, is far easier to state than achieve. In many cases you will find a treasure but be unable to take it until you are carrying the right combination of objects you find in the various locations.\nHow do you know which objects you need? Trial and error, logic and imagination. Each time you try some action, you learn a little more about the game. Which brings us to the term \"game\" again. While called games, Adventures are actually puzzles because you have to discover which way the pieces actions, manipulations, use of magic words, etc.) fit together in order to gather your treasures or accomplish the mission. Like a puzzle, there are a number of ways to fit the pieces together, players who have found and stored all the treasures (there are 13) of Adventure#1 may have done so in different ways.\nIn finding how the pieces fit, you will be forced to deal with unexpected events, apparent dead ends and Scott's humor, which is one of the best parts of the puzzles.\nf you run into a barrier like not being able to discover more rooms, don't give up. Play the game with some friends; sometimes they'll think of things you haven't tried.\nWhile I pondered how to reach the throne room -- which I was sure contained the treasures of Croesus - the fog grew thicker and the hours passed. I realized I would not be able to outwit Adams today...but maybe tomorrow. I marked my present location on my tattered map and began the long trip to the surface. As I dragged myself off to bed, I thought about other possible Adventures.\nBut enough for tonight. Tomorrow - another crack at the chasm.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1odgTG-M_mc","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Adventure International","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90783,"FileName":"6ae6c4e5-455f-4f49-b64b-ec6af9aa67af.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90783,"FileName":"d7695a63-1028-4466-a0ec-2fd3ecb8c527.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90783,"FileName":"a0d06874-80a9-4e09-ab3b-a6acf433a0d1.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90783,"FileName":"89de6d25-2af0-4a4f-b47f-205c27de5aae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90783,"FileName":"46a78620-0c80-492b-a386-de1c3ea6b6c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136231,"Name":"Sea Dragon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Sea Dragon is an arcade style side scrolling shooter.

The player can also check the status of each unit, and set the mission for each taskforce, including: anti-surface, anti-submarine, attack shore targets, or shadow an enemy taskforce. The player is also given the length of time until additional ships arrive in the naval theater. In the second section, the player gives movement orders to each taskforce, as well as submarine and air support. In the third section, the player is given the results of intelligence collection, searches by task force and submarines, as well as the options to launch attacks against a particular target or location.\n\nThe game starts at rising tension, but as direct combat between forces continues, there is the risk of escalating to global nuclear warfare, at which point the game ends. Otherwise, the game with a ceasefire after a set number of turns. If the game ends in ceasefire, both sides receive a score based upon the effectiveness of their command.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"W.

It's of course the player's task to disarm the device before the bombs go off. The problem is that the device can neither be turned off nor destroyed so the player character has to shrink himself, enter the machine as an electron and neutralize it from within. In the device there are twelve microchips that the player has to disarm and each microchip represents one level.\n\nEach level shows the circuit of the microchip which contains three batteries. To complete a level the player has to use the batteries' power voltage to overload the microchip. By touching one of the batteries it's power is transferred to the other two and the aim is to reach a power value that is greater than 999. Once the battery is overloaded the microchip becomes vulnerable and if the player manages to reach the battery after that the circuit will blow. Another way to send power to the batteries is to collect microsparks which are usually found at dead ends.\n\nThe player moves around the circuit by following the traces but has to watch out for neutrons, double neutrons and photos since any contact with these will drain power from the batteries and also alert the device. Getting hit five times will lead to the microfuse sending out a detonation pulse. That will also happen if a level is not completed quickly enough or if all batteries are completely drained. The game is over after this has happened three times since the bombs will then go off and there won't be anything left of the world.\n\nAfter completing a level the player gets a chance to increase his score through a lightning run. Here the player has a limited time (depending on how much power is left on the overloaded battery) to run over the photons and neutrons. The only thing to watch out for is the vacuum that roams the circuitry which ends the run upon contact.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"David Schroeder","Publisher":"Micro Fun","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":163847,"FileName":"0cc9baec-bcf7-408c-bb00-129c9e931fd4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":163847,"FileName":"ba41e22a-6354-44f3-8461-90901f801f8a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163847,"FileName":"6bf8cc28-87b6-4dff-b509-0567764943f6.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":163847,"FileName":"9c14eb7f-aadb-4032-8255-69c18dc009b3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136276,"Name":"Shuffleboard","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Shuffleboard by IDSI is the computerized version of the classic game found on the decks of ocean liners as well as in your favorite tavern.

The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.\n\nSpace Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.\n\nWhen docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Flight Simulator; Role-Playing","Developer":"Origin Systems","Publisher":"Origin","ReleaseDate":"1989-10-06T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136290,"FileName":"179554c5-32b7-4bd2-89f2-d6284c2070c1.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136290,"FileName":"647357a2-162c-4673-b90f-128362d8f104.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136290,"FileName":"9c0ac926-3128-4a50-8afc-2de24c20260a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136290,"FileName":"45e70bd2-fcc5-4223-86b2-0536ad435744.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136290,"FileName":"d4ad96c7-8e4e-42f5-aca2-700a005d45e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136291,"Name":"Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space is a space flight simulator game designed by Steve Kitchen for the Atari 2600 and published by Activision in 1983.It is one of the first realistic spacecraft simulations available for home systems.

Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, you proceed to the next level.\n\nBut the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the \"piggy bank\". You must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank. Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over.\n\nBetween levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you have the ability to access these intermissions.

It is Infocom's eighteenth game.  \n\nOver the course of events in the trilogy's earlier games from 956 to 957 GUE (Enchanter and Sorcerer), the player's character has progressed from a novice wizard possessing a few weak spells to the leader of the Circle of Enchanters. Now, in 966 GUE (ten years after the events of Enchanter), the very foundations of Magic itself seem to be failing, and the leaders of all the Guilds in the land have gathered to demand answers. In the midst of this impassioned meeting, the crowd is suddenly transformed into a group of toads and newts. Everyone present is affected except for the player and a shadowy figure who flees the hall.\n\nIn the course of investigating the mystery, the player learns new, powerful spells that must be used in novel ways. But since magic is no longer dependable, each spell has a chance of failing. The only objects that can help to shore up the effectiveness of sorcery are the Cubes of Foundation, each of which can transport the player to a different location and strengthen certain spells.\n\nEventually the player discovers a terrible secret: the shadowy figure responsible for all this chaos is a dark twin. Even with magic, every action has an equal and opposite reaction; and with every spell cast, the player's opposite has grown stronger. Finally, this evil being seizes the magic cubes and uses them to construct a portal which will bestow near-infinite power. The only way to defeat the doppelgänger is to sabotage the portal, an action which also leads to the destruction of all magic.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Infocom","Publisher":"Infocom","ReleaseDate":"1985-09-10T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136295,"FileName":"d8e8be22-b4ce-4cff-b125-46b6f822ae78.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136295,"FileName":"6aadbe0d-fa1c-4fc6-aaee-3e1176cbd617.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136295,"FileName":"d528b97a-b67b-4868-abc1-fe05331a8406.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136295,"FileName":"859eb7b3-2ba3-40bd-884f-81681133f1cc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136297,"Name":"Spider Raid","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"From the games packaging\n\n\"The great human war of 2017 has nearly destroyed the Earth.

The revolutionary parts of Star League Baseball are its budding attempts to simulate “a baseball game”.  First, presentation is similar to a local-broadcast of a game.  No commercials, but trivia, “scores from around the league”, attendance numbers, etc, are all presented between innings.  Second, Gamestar went beyond just stats, and, for the first time, brought in the human-element by adding fatigue to pitchers.\n\nStar League Baseball helped lay the foundation for current generation sports simulations, by adding previously unused variables, it turned sports games towards the direction of simulating the sport.

You have a suit of force-shielded, powered armor which jumps, flies, self-repairs, and will even tend to your wounds. Skulk in the woods and snipe, or move fast and blast away.

Terrain is key to survival, as sooner or later you'll need to go to ground and heal up. However, it can hinder your reconnaissance as much as your enemies', and sometimes you'll find yourself under fire from an unseen source. Sound matters, too: your powergun is nearly silent, but the blaster alerts enemies as effectively as it destroys them.\n\nPlay is turn-based, but fast. The opportunity to press the right key flits by quickly, bringing new bursts of enemy gunfire around you. Varying movement options, weapons, and enemies make tactics the determining factor in your success. Two scenarios fit into the story: a diversionary expedition to blast everything in sight (except the civvies, so check your targets!), and a search-and-destroy mission to start the revolution.

The first four power stations built during Project Moon Base have been destroyed during an asteroid storm, and only one station remains. You play as the repair droid at the last remaining nuclear power plant on the moon. You must keep the base repaired and beam energy to Earth, while a new storm approaches. The player starts with 3 lives, when all are lost, it's game over.\n\nContains a series of 4 arcade mini-games. In the first section, the player must generate energy by opening and closing cooling ducts on the power plant. The player moves about an 8 x 4 grid, and can open and close cooling ducts by jumping on them. Meteors stream from above, and if they hit the player they lose a life. Meteors will also close a duct if they hit. The player has a small heat gauge, which increases as more ducts are closed, but the closer to maximum heat, the faster electricity is produced. Meteors can also destroy a duct, leaving it permanently closed, giving the player less room to work to maintain ideal electricity generation. The goal is to keep exactly the number of ducts closed to maximize electricity production, without going over, which will cause the generator to melt down. If the player has not accumulated enough energy at melt down, it's game over.\n\nIn the second stage, the player moves to the Transmission Site, where the player must construct transmission towers to send power to the satellite beaming site. In this section, the player once again moves on a 8 x 4 grid, and must collect transmission tower pieces. While doing this, they must avoid neutralization towers and dangerous energy discharges. The more towers that are constructed, the faster the electricity accumulated in the previous section is transported.\n\nThe next step is the Transporter Room, where the goal is to push down all 32 buttons on the 8 x 4 grid. To complicate this, enemy Togglers and Plasma Balls threaten to destroy the player, and can also flip switches back to their off position. When all 32 buttons are pressed, the player is beamed into space to the Orbiting Relay Station.\n\nHere, the player must maintain 3 large satellite arrays, which are beaming energy to the Earth. They will be intermittently destroyed by rogue meteorites, and the player must collect repair pieces dropped off by supply shuttles to keep the power flowing. The player must avoid space junk, meteorites, and power transmissions. The player has a limited fuel supply, and must resupply, or he won't be able to navigate, and drift off into space. Once all the energy is transported to Earth, the player is victorious, and can advance to a more difficult challenge level.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Stephen Goss","Publisher":"Micro Fun","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164946,"FileName":"e83a7f78-f0b0-4af9-8ad8-973ed86ed079.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":164946,"FileName":"42d38c23-c04b-4c7e-8764-12904156c3b1.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164946,"FileName":"be493423-de8b-4834-b8d8-8d38a52f4845.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164946,"FileName":"4fc9acc2-87cb-477b-bef2-053c836d81d1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164946,"FileName":"6748b0c7-8a8a-4864-93a6-65b9b1532ff5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136340,"Name":"Stellar 7","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Stellar 7 is an action-style tank simulation video game based on the arcade game Battlezone in which the player assumes the role of a futuristic tank pilot.

I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.\n\nFor the javelin even you hold down fire to build up speed, and push left to throw the javelin, holding it left before releasing to change the angle. In the equestrian event, you must use up to increase speed, and fire or right to jump when appropriate to clear the hazards - too many faults will see you disqualified.\n\nFencing involves moving your foil using the joystick, always staying one step ahead of your opponent, retreating when appropriate. The kayaking event involves navigating a river by controlling the direction, ensuring that all the gates are past correctly even when this requires some precise lining up. You can also load the events from Summer Games 1 in, to play all 16 events in a marathon session.","MaxPlayers":"8","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmzxrOgnp1Q","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Epyx, Inc.","Publisher":"Epyx, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"8246cc01-e5fb-4159-b57d-d1cf8979960d.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"072855fd-d65e-4ba1-af11-879b19aee2c9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"2eafecf7-d367-4d77-af2c-9509874c637d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"f489b5c5-47a4-4efe-a633-a3fc82ec52a3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"aa55d3e7-0e0e-4c77-93a1-ac9d5d71d9f9.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"80fdc875-bbf9-496a-9cc9-1eaf1070d65c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"cc890e23-fb14-44ae-8930-87d28102da00.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"9a13527b-1f1e-4187-ba9b-7fe5c30d4bb6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"e9005e87-21e2-4e3e-8e60-ace845cf2f11.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"35a0a0fe-d6fc-4b80-8d05-49c7e0d36814.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"26a715b2-3491-4a26-98d4-82c965f3f37f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"15c32140-d163-4b02-8b61-0bded05e769d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"3829f5c3-e885-4006-ac96-4e48b3c6015b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"98d3d4a7-0782-49bc-ac02-db6519b52f59.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"2912f495-7342-4301-8814-8f6188fb155f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"65eb2d5d-e909-48a0-aa21-6cad0469b30d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"fe1f5e99-1b92-45ee-a0b4-b91744a88f98.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"6663553e-db5c-4c3b-b43b-fcc1f0f5415a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132717,"FileName":"d7562098-e647-41e9-a4c9-0bb7e8a10a5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136350,"Name":"SunDog: Frozen Legacy","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"SunDog: Frozen Legacy is a 1984 space trading and combat simulator video game.

The player is based out of Hong Kong and has a single trading ship with which he can transport one of four cargoes from place to place. There are different cargoes to be traded, from the cheaper general goods to the more expensive arms and silks, culminating in the opportunity to trade in the illegal opium trade.\n\nGenerally, the strategy here was buy low, sell high. To add some tension to the game, there is a random chance that you will encounter several obstacles to your trading empire. Random pirates, pickpockets, and thieves who rob you and your warehouse are all out there for their own benefit (and your detriment!) Li Yuen acts as the local mafia boss, extorting increasing sums of money for his \"protection\". Local authorities will seize your opium and fine you if you're caught, ruining an otherwise successful voyage. Local market conditions can render a price extremely high or low, giving you a chance to make a quick buck.\n\nYou have the option to trade up to a larger ship as time goes buy, as well as outfit your current ship with guns. However, beware! The larger the ship, the more pirate ships it attracts! Also, the larger ships are more expensive to repair.\n\nYou can play as long as you want--you're given the opportunity to retire once you reach one million. You're given a score at the end of the game based on your net worth, your ship size, and a few other factors.\n\nAll in all, this is a pretty decent trading simulation, even if the monochrome graphics left something to be desired. Although some parents may want to avoid a game with opium in it, overall it's great for teaching basic economic concepts to kids.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation; Strategy; Education","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Avalanche Productions Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":179549,"FileName":"e938c4f0-0a10-49e2-96fa-a334d068c9cb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":179549,"FileName":"8236d435-786b-4bdc-9717-95588043fc5e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":179549,"FileName":"cc7e5314-c18e-4827-9855-d65440e6433d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164903,"Name":"Tales of Mystery","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"\"Tales of Mystery\" is a 1984 pair of adventure games distributed by Scholastic, Inc.

Crawford sold the PET version himself;[2] being programmed in BASIC, it was easy to port from one system to the other. Avalon Hill published a 1981 release for the TRS-80 and Apple II as well as the Atari series.\n\nThe game simulated a two-player tank battle on a large hex grid. Tanktics had no graphics; the player moved tokens on a map using coordinates the computer, acting as referee, provided. Crawford used maps and tokens from Avalon Hill's Panzer Leader when developing the game. To compensate for the computer's weak artificial intelligence, he gave it twice as many tanks as the player. There were several terrain types -- forests, lakes, plains, rough and depressed ground—and also roads which allowed much faster movement in their direction. There were also many different types of tanks—different ones for the German and Russian side each—as well as stationary anti-tank guns. At the end of the game, a point system determines whether the player has won or lost the game.\n\nCrawford later reported that Wargy I defeated several experienced war gamers at a December 1976 convention.  Because of the technical limitations of the game and microcomputer hardware, Tanktics was not a success. Computer Gaming World praised the game as simply fun. Complaints included the lack of a two-player mode, and the requirement for all tanks on one side to be wiped out before the game ends.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Chris Crawford","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132662,"FileName":"e10a426a-783a-4870-b9fa-0bec51901a90.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132662,"FileName":"14929998-1d1b-4c11-8711-4a2e7bfb790d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132662,"FileName":"a50a1c9d-aff9-4890-9df0-74b5407973e9.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132662,"FileName":"cee5d8e7-f34f-4fee-a15c-46ebb7cf517e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136378,"Name":"Tapper","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Tapper, also known as Root Beer Tapper, is a 1983 arcade game released by Bally Midway.

It was largely an expansion of the ideas introduced in Oldorf's Revenge. This was a very early hi-res vector graphics and text adventure game of the same era and style as Mystery House. Intriguingly, Tarturian, like Oldorf's Revenge, allowed you to choose to switch between various types of characters, such as the Wizard, Thief, Strongman, Elf, etc. The game has two mechanics limiting the number of times you can \"change\" into each character, which layered on an element of resource management that was unique for an adventure game of its day. Each of these characters allowed certain specialized text parser commands. For example, only the Wizard can \"cast\" (a spell) while only the Thief can \"unlock\", \"pick\", \"open\", etc. This list of text commands is only knowable if you have the instruction manual for the game. This also allows for multiple solutions to the same puzzle. For example, the initial door can be unlocked by the Thief, or blasted off it's hinges if the Wizard casts a spell. This is very much unlike more popular games of the era like Mystery House, which allowed for only one solution to each puzzle.\n\nAdditionally, the manual provided other info about how to play that is essential knowledge for gameplay.

This will mean contending with a complex of dark and confusing underground passages, the Abductor's guards, a contentious bandit, and several magic items, including two unique magic swords.\n\nEventually, however, the adventurer will come to the throne room where the Abductor himself waits with his thuggish minions. Once overcome, however, the adventurer is free to search for the way into his dungeons where he/she can find his/her kidnapped friend, as well as several treasures looted by the villain. \n\nRevised\t21 June 1985\n\nEamon Deluxe version\n\nAs with the other Deluxe versions of Jim Jacobson's adventures, Frank Black has made significant additions to the play. Some of these take the form of alterations in description, such as the \"Guard 1\" and \"Guard 2\"-type enemies in the original being altered to be more amusing. Others involve smoothing over some rough edges, such as the bandit encounter which in the original adventure involves the player's money being unavoidably stolen by a bandit; now one can reclaim it after reaching the Abductor's vault.\n\nBlack also replaced five rooms to the program which appeared in the original code but were not used in the game, and added some appropriate treasure items to them, though still (as with the original) most of the treasure is found in the Abductor's vault.

In the confusion, several lab animals have also fled their cages, so the ship's life sign scanners cannot be used to pinpoint the location of the alien creature. The commander orders the crew to sweep every room and corridor of the ship so the alien can be recaptured as fast as possible. What the Thrasybulus crew don't know: the creature is a highly advanced predator, able to metamorphose into new forms quickly, and ready to kill without warning. A nightmarish fight for survival begins.\n\nThe Alien is a turn-based strategy game, in plot and setting inspired heavily by the classic 1979 science fiction horror film of almost the same name. The goal is to either capture or kill the alien, or, for a worst case scenario, engage the ship's self destruct sequence and escape in the shuttles. The crew consists of seven members, each one belonging to one of three character types with different skills: Officers, scientists and engineers. Officers can access the ship's armory and engage the self destruct, scientists can handle lab equipment and access the computer system, and engineers can rig equipment to construct makeshift weapons.\n\nIn each game turn, the game switches between any rooms where crew members are present. After choosing which person should act next, one from a list of pre-defined actions can be selected. These include picking up and combining items, using weapons and equipment, catching escaped animals and using ship systems like the airlock, computer or self destruct activation. After actions are taken, the crew members can be moved around the ship. To aid in plotting movements, the game displays a map of the 30 rooms of the ship that also shows crew and equipment status as well as the life scanner readings.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124664,"FileName":"fac4ce0d-935d-4a37-bd67-9ba715cea375.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124664,"FileName":"8818291a-e80d-4156-9725-e0c828c29580.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124664,"FileName":"c51b5c56-137a-4097-96c8-284beea18e6c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124664,"FileName":"b5b4f07b-0648-4a84-986d-8431536d4fdc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124664,"FileName":"a3afd848-ecbd-4fc8-b61b-89435a47484c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124664,"FileName":"5339ddc2-c187-4f64-888b-c6bf661030e3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124589,"Name":"The Alpine Encounter","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Two major crimes have taken place in different parts of the world.

The game is set in ancient battle-style times before the use of gun powder, consisting of the three basic unit types of that period: the light armored but fast 'barbarians', the heavily armored but slow 'knights', and the ranged 'archers'. A fourth non-combatant unit type is also available: 'spies', which is only available under certain campaign rule settings. \n\nThe game consists of different scenarios to choose from, each with a different geographical setting, difficulty setting, visibility setting, and victory condition setting. Some settings may be subject to change by the player.\n\nGameplay is represented in two major areas:\nThe first is the tactical/political map, which visualizes geographical and terrain elements from a top-down perspective. Here the player can coordinate, position, reinforce troops, and also command them to attack, defend or ambush enemy troops in a real-time setting. Time may be set to pause, faster or slower to make battle plans easier.\n\nThe second is the combat screen where one group of soldiers fight another group of the enemy. A squad consisting a maximum of 14 soldiers will fight according to their set battle formation and will act only on the player's real-time battle commands (e.g. attack, forward, retreat, etc.).\nThe difficulty levels are represented by eight opponents, which include the Greek goddess of war Athena, a stereotypical Russian-Soviet commander named Crazy Ivan, as well as the historical characters Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Geronimo, and Sun Tzu as the hardest opponent. Each opponent has a different fighting style of combat and strategy.\n\nThe game also comes with a construction set which allows the player to create own campaigns: From the story, rules to the map editor. In this game editor, the player can also tweak troops to the player's liking, such as default troop formations.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Broderbund","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"1c9022ac-d8c5-4c8a-a9b3-fb7b99b46a7e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"afda01de-306a-4552-bdbf-53cc9db94845.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"db11e71b-6323-473e-a1aa-ab839939f7ca.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"46a4d6d1-5beb-48d4-890b-de85b2e1269d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"3f203625-d17b-4869-bdb5-e9802c0013ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"19ab216d-f458-40e0-b580-c8ea8c25c4ed.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"eabb8c76-e409-498e-aae5-c696a913db2b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"6bfaa3df-a8de-47b1-b975-6128e5088ed4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"01be710e-2d59-4438-97f9-c565d3d83e07.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"c5e36947-00bc-4888-b631-25d0e0faffd3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"2b48cc7c-f169-410c-97ff-cce85028eda8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124694,"FileName":"b4ca18dd-35cf-4be9-85a5-43b72dfd740f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124669,"Name":"The Ancient Art of War at Sea","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The Ancient Art of War at Sea is the sequel to the Ancient Art of War, where the battle campaigns now takes place in the vast oceans of naval combat.\n\nThe game is a top-down semi real-time strategy game.

As its predecessor, the game comes with different difficulty settings, symbolized by several famous naval commanders and also comes with a game editor.\n\nShip Types\nAs its predecessor, the game introduces three different types of units in the game:\n\nThe frigate, small but fastest ship in the fleet.\nThe ship-of-the-line, the primary battleship in the fleet.\nThe flagship, well armed but slow. Flagships are the moving strategic flags that need to be captured in order to win the game.\nThe aim of the game is to capture all the enemy flagships while protecting flagships under the player's control. As added difficulty, new ships cannot be built, however enemy ships may be captured by boarding them.\n\nMain Map\nThe main map provides information regarding friendly and enemy unit location, ports, and certain waters that may cause damage to ships that cross it. Reparations and supplies may be obtained in the many ports provided on the main map. Whether or not supplies or reparations may take place depend on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCertain types of waters may be dangerous for ships to sail across. There are two different types of waters: shallow waters and dangerous waters. The larger the ship, usually the more damage they take when they cross those seas. This however also depends on the options or rules provided on the scenario setting.\n\nCombat\nSea combat enters a top down tactical map, where the player can control several ships at once. During sea combat, the aim of the game is to sink the opposing fleet by firing cannons or by boarding and capturing the ship.\n\nWhen to ships collide with each other, the combat screen enters the boarding screen. There are two different units provided when boarding: swordsmen (pirates with cutlasses, for melee) and musketeers (ranged combat). The winner is the last man standing. Certain ports provide different type of pirate units, however this is not explicitly mentioned within the game.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRr1C9BUkjk","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Evryware","Publisher":"Brøderbund Software, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"a8473161-39b4-401b-85fb-efe47cc34a4c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"a9dd015c-08ad-4ef2-a74e-5e720136d627.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"f4450f13-e8c2-4e75-b75c-85f8defb01fc.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"b00633ff-1a01-48e6-891e-c38d1ac96d46.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"9f2f36eb-bd15-459e-9a79-1792ff418204.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"f3fa781b-2d16-448d-b1ba-4e4d9382b22a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"333d92a1-6008-4c9d-bd8c-fe263ecdd8d0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"ee546319-6c3a-47bd-97c4-b6879084b9d6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"e8ca9ec8-cdb1-469a-b72c-b94db79b71b9.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124669,"FileName":"f2782371-d771-46b2-a69b-813289ff67c6.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":165027,"Name":"The Arcade Machine","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"The Arcade Machine allows you to create alien blastfests à la Galaxian.

It was made shortly after the first King's Quest game, so it resembled that adventure in many ways. Along with The Dark Crystal it remains one of only a few adventure games by Sierra to be based on films.\n\nThe player character is a young assistant pig-keeper, Taran, undertaking a quest to stop the evil Horned King, who sought for Hen Wen, the magical pig of the wizard Dallben, for her visionary abilities. With these abilities, the King would be able to discover the Black Cauldron and rule the land. Taran's first mission is to lead her to the Fair Folk while the King's Gwythiants are looking for them. Should the pig be captured (the game allows either possibility), Taran can go to the King's castle and rescue her. Once inside, Taran will meet and rescue Eilonwy with her magic bauble and Fflewddur Fflam, as well as discover a Magic Sword. The Cauldron is in the possession of three witches of Morva who will trade it for the Sword. Unfortunately a gwythiant grasps the cauldron and Taran goes back to encounter the evil man himself. The game actually featured plot branches and multiple endings depending on many variables, such as whether Hen Wen the pig was saved, how the cauldron was destroyed and what reward was chosen afterwards. This use of multiple endings predated the more famous use in Lucasfilm's game Maniac Mansion by a year.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://youtu.be/008xu4KSCCY","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":117459,"FileName":"ea4c48e7-373e-4009-9150-11dd11fae7d1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117459,"FileName":"404773a1-10f9-438a-9f82-07eaed71436c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":117459,"FileName":"2c6589b2-c21e-4220-bdc5-ccdc680eea76.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":117459,"FileName":"f2589021-8352-42ab-9149-cf72c3f229f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":117459,"FileName":"d718ba9f-bcc4-4dd7-bc13-d0af0e422b39.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134161,"Name":"The Black Sage","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Black Sage is subtitled \"an Ogres & Orcs adventure.\"  The game is a Dungeon and Dragons-like role playing game.

However, they must maneuver around an eccentric family of Italian criminals -- the Fratellis -- on the lam, who are also on the trail of the treasure.\n\nThe game is divided into a series of eight screens based on scenes from the film, each of which contains puzzles that must be solved by coordinating the activities of two of the kids from the Goonies (and in the last screen, the elephant-man-like Sloth) without getting killed by deadly bats, homicidal Fratellis, flying demon-skull thingies, or other environmental hazards. For example, in one screen one player must wind up and hold a winch that lifts a large stone so that the other player can pass it, run backward on a ball floating in deadly water, bypass a series of three water buckets going up and down that kill you if you do not time your passage underneath correctly, jump to the top of a rail, and slide across to grab the key to the door below -- and all this without getting hit by a wandering bat.\n\nThe game keeps a score and a high score, and you have a certain number of lives, which would be replenished at certain points or at certain score totals, and there is no save feature. In other words, the game had to be played all in one sitting, near-perfectly, to see the ending. The Goonies can be played single-player, with the joystick button used to switch between the two characters on-screen, or cooperatively, with each player controlling one of the characters.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeqeJgkWLOw","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Datasoft","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":134990,"FileName":"2d2f82cd-885d-411a-9c8b-d0c743637a5f.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":134990,"FileName":"7139415a-3d72-4673-801b-09be934e5f63.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134990,"FileName":"db31c772-cc76-4f18-b3cb-cd4ca4878160.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134990,"FileName":"90a27588-2d04-40af-95e2-555fc0f78a0a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":134990,"FileName":"be9424a5-959f-4aac-ad22-aadcf64b5909.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":134991,"Name":"The Great American Cross-Country Road Race","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"The Great American Cross-Country Road Race (UK re-release title: American Road Race) is a racing video game written by Alex DeMeo for the Atari 8-bit computers and published by Activision in 1985.

It was later released in France by ERE Informatique in 1986, and was released in the United States by Datasoft later that year. It was also ported to the Tatung Einstein home computer in 1989, exclusively in the United Kingdom. It is the fifth instalment of the Strategic Wargames series.\n\nThe game is set during a fictional war in Europe between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, in which both sides use nuclear and chemical weapons against each other. The main objective of the game is to fight conventional battles in continental Europe, whilst trying to avoid a worldwide nuclear holocaust. Throughout the game, various capital cities and their civilian populations will be destroyed by nuclear weapons; the game will only end once either side is forced to surrender or if the entire population of Europe perishes. In order to request a nuclear strike, the player was required to call a dedicated telephone number, which led to an automated message announcing the authorisation code.\n\nDuring development, the developers obtained extensive information and statistics of military strength from the Ministry of Defence and the Soviet embassy in London. Theatre Europe gained national controversy upon release, receiving criticism from both the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) and The Sun newspaper. Some high street retail chains refused to sell the game upon release. Despite the controversy, the game received critical acclaim from reviewers. Praise was directed at its accuracy, playability and value for money. It won the \"Best Strategy Game\" award at the 1985 Golden Joystick Awards and was nominated for the \"Game of the Year\" title.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cA3WtGa-PQ","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Personal Software Services","Publisher":"Datasoft","ReleaseDate":"1986-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136385,"FileName":"c5dc24eb-cec7-4435-b5ab-b8f6133af70c.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136385,"FileName":"e0c1f41b-64b6-4aeb-b150-6a280abae275.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":136385,"FileName":"52697c64-a931-4c83-a5e0-c8e7203d1eb2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136385,"FileName":"9e58ba70-facc-4af4-999f-ceb88a5d336a.png","Type":"Fanart - Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136385,"FileName":"c6322661-1277-45b3-845c-ec420adea740.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136385,"FileName":"fd051dfd-31c0-4945-a386-816ec624ce53.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136386,"Name":"Theseus and the Minotaur","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The player controls the actions of Theseus, Athenian prince of Ancient Greece, as he wanders through a randomly-generated (under user parameters) 3-D labyrinth in search of the horrible Minotaur, a monster half-man, half-bull, in order to slay the unnatural creature.

Once it reached its maximum you can't fire anymore and are forced to wait until it cools down while slowly running out of fuel.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo2LU5SgQWg","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"On-Line Systems","Publisher":"On-Line Systems","ReleaseDate":"1981-09-11T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136388,"FileName":"0c73d31d-01d4-4bbf-b760-c1274f0d42ad.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136388,"FileName":"34e922d3-c8f2-4922-8dce-2fba83cad85d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136388,"FileName":"f4e5b038-d7fa-43ec-a635-9bcd9e9fcd61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164973,"Name":"Thunderchopper","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Thunderchopper puts you in a Hughes 530 MG Defender helicopter, and offers several modes of play.

Ramadu, the mighty and sinister ruler of the planet Neburon, a thousand light years away, is about to declare war on weaker and smaller Earth--a war which would mean total destruction, or worse, total servitude on the part of the people of Earth, to the evil Ramadu.\n\nFor thousands of years the inhabitants of Neburon (a very advanced society) have watched the struggling and developing Earthlings--as one would watch animals in a zoo. The Neburites, over the years, had traveled to Earth, sometimes learning, sometimes teaching, always curious. They saw revealed to them, in the development of Earthlings, their own beginnings so many millions of years ago.\n\nBut Earth was catching up to Neburon--technically, medically, scientifically, all ways, Neburon had once been extremely advanced compared to Earth but had grown comfortable and lazy.\n\nThe Neburites were in a slump. They needed a stimulus. They were angry about Earth's advancement and their own inactivity. Why, if something was not done about it, Earth might very well pass Neburon in superiority in a few decades!\n\nSo Ramadu had come to power. But instead of spurring his people on to new growth and productivity, and perhaps working with Earth to trade knowledge and ideas beneficial to both, he chose war. After all, Neburon was still more powerful than Earth and the Earthlings wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nThe year is 1981. You are an ordinary person walking through a meadow one day, when you notice a strange looking contraption right in the middle of the meadow. You glance around you. There appears to be no one around. You look inside the contraption--there are a lot of dials and something that looks like a bucket seat. The outside of the contraption is round with a large inviting doorway. Hesitantly, you enter the contraption and sit down in the bucket seat. Gingerly, you turn a dial and suddenly reality becomes a blue as you enter the greatest adventure of your life!","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBE8K0XG65I","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":90847,"FileName":"1921b52d-e146-4fef-9346-0dc0750aa97a.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90847,"FileName":"616766a9-a164-4e31-842b-7580b78a6bf9.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90847,"FileName":"489babe1-63e2-4296-8052-c420829cd772.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90847,"FileName":"3abe5520-d792-471e-9b5a-8e1528d4f88b.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":90847,"FileName":"bb053035-ead9-4ca5-a6b3-cee984fb15a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":136390,"Name":"Times of Lore","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The Kingdom of Albereth was under attack of barbarian forces.

The periods are the Time of Legends (a mythological period), Pangea (about 300 to 250 million years ago), B.C. (1423, \"before the dawn of civilization\"), A.D. (1990), and the Aftermath (after 2112).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPYI46jxHdg","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Richard Garriott","Publisher":"Sierra Online, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1982-08-24T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"367ddd5d-baa1-4a51-83f5-a85b16df2b3e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"fe9afc30-5c28-4edd-9afd-9cb8b49aac57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"8a0c3b4f-5ab8-4277-8948-3f2cd5aaa0f2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"f7b01a03-d8c0-4a08-9d75-607dd91ecb41.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"d5e1ddb6-5d20-4905-9bb7-5f0ed2cbda22.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"4ed9d919-1ee5-495e-9ba8-c57f867058cd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133329,"FileName":"e73b5407-c784-476c-98ac-887eaa642c68.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133311,"Name":"Ultima III: Exodus","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Ultima III: Exodus is the third game in the Ultima series.

Originally developed for the Apple II, Exodus was eventually ported to 13 other platforms, including a NES/Famicom remake.\n\nExodus featured revolutionary graphics for its time, as one of the first computer RPGs to display animated characters. Also, Exodus differs from previous games in that players now direct the actions of a party of four characters rather than just one. During regular play the characters are represented as a single player icon and move as one. However, in battle mode, each character is represented separately on a separate \"battle screen\" and the player alternates commands between each character in order, followed by each enemy character having a turn. Thus the player must understand weapons and magic commands and employ rudimentary tactics in order to overcome each opponent. This differs from the two previous games in the Ultima series in which the player is simply depicted as trading blows with one opponent on the main map until either is defeated. Enemies on the overworld map can be seen and at least temporarily avoided, while enemies in a dungeon may appear randomly without any forewarning.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=HErKitZ0ovM","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","Publisher":"ORIGIN Systems, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"9177ba1f-2625-44bc-9a27-fc4c6f772db1.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"0e157531-9c43-4001-9785-fab6a72517df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"43bc35e8-79fe-49b1-b6a0-6ce29c511fa0.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"857adeaa-fe3b-4c68-98ed-72caa0a4314e.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"26190a3c-1eaf-4d99-8b84-b65995e14542.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"d7d871cf-3e9a-4543-8e35-9d53179cd8f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"b46a452b-388f-4d17-8ddc-c09e1d18ab9e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"e3683b16-9b2f-46a8-bdb3-0ab2dc047b6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133311,"FileName":"5a226517-f301-4381-9cf4-d0486384ed91.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133330,"Name":"Ultima IV: Quest of The Avatar","ReleaseYear":"1985","Overview":"Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar, first released in 1985 for the Apple II, is the fourth in the series of Ultima role-playing video games.

I reviewed the first game, Dunzhin, in January, and the second, Kaiv, just a few weeks ago (links to my reviews). The games are characterized by an unnamed hero who explores the titular areas and fights numerous random combats, all with the goal of reaching a far-flung area and collecting a treasure.\n\nAll of them are light on most classic role-playing elements. The series has limited back stories, no character creation, no NPCs, limited equipment (no equipment at all in the first game), and limited character development. For these reasons, the games have earned lower scores on my GIMLET. Nonetheless, they do features some interesting innovations for the era, in particular a complex system in which every body part has its own hit points, armor class, and protection. This is true of both the PC and his foes, and combat becomes an exercise in determining whether to strike easy-to-hit but well-armored places, like chests and abdomens, or low-HP but hard-to-hit locations like heads and necks. The combat system is also slightly more tactical than the average game of the era in that it allows you to spend rounds AIMing or to sacrifice accuracy for power in FORCE attacks.\n\nAlso notable about the series is the way that the author, Randall Masteller, rapidly added features as the titles progressed. Dunzhin had no inventory, but Kaiv offered some basic armor and weapons, including the odds of weapons breaking in combat, the need to keep a stock of torches, and the need to eat and drink occasionally. The Wylde, meanwhile, builds upon the previous games with a more complicated combat system.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Screenplay","Publisher":"Screenplay","ReleaseDate":"1983-09-13T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":136479,"FileName":"aa1098e5-8c9c-4882-80cb-a17e524d0144.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":136479,"FileName":"50288708-7f39-4d8c-80c6-f4d640f95ba2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":136479,"FileName":"18b21eb3-9594-4e95-a457-1d5d4ce8f7c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":136479,"AlternateName":"Warrior of Ras, Volume 3: The Wylde","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":136478,"Name":"Warrior of Ras: Vol. 2: Kaiv","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This is the sequel to the first part of the Warriors of Ras series, Dunzhin. All games in this series are early graphical Roguelikes. The story is quite simple: Enter the mystical monster-infested dungeon Kaiv, slay monsters and grab treasures. \n\nYou explore the dungeon in a turn-based manner by entering commands in text adventure, like \"MOVE NORTH\" or \"LIGHT TORCH\". The commands may be abbreviated by one or two letters. You can also move several squares at once (like \"MOVE EAST 3\") to speed up your quest. Another very helpful command is \"SPEED\", which makes the game's messages go by faster. Your progress is hindered by traps (acid pools, slimey floors etc., some of which you can escape by quickly pressing a key), thieves who rob you, random teleports and, of course, by a variety of 24 different monsters, ranging from simple Zombies, Wolves or Dwarves up to Wyverns and Vampires.\n\nThe combat system makes the Warriors of Ras series stand out from other roguelikes: Apart from your total hit points, you and the monsters also have hit points and armor for each body party separately. If the hit points of one body part reach zero, you're dead. Each attack must be directed to one of the body parts, some of which are easier to hit than others. You may also \"AIM\" a hit (which costs some time, but makes the attack more likely to hit) or \"FORCE\" an attack (this makes it more difficult to hit, but increases the damage). This and the body parts result in a quite tactical combat -- you have to guess or find out the weak parts of your opponent and choose the right way of attacking.\n\nKaiv extends the originally quite simple game of Dunzhin by adding a shop at the dungeon entrance where you can equip yourself. You now also have a bigger variety of items like torches, crosses (against Vampires) and mirrors (against Gorgons), and you can also find magical items: several rings, wands or potions that improve your magical or physical protection or increase you fighting skills. You also need to take enough food and drink with you to prevent dying from hunger or thirst.\n\nThe difficulty level of the game is quite high with new characters -- you often die just by being hit once by a low-level monster or by stepping into some trap.

The player guides band of Desert Rangers from town to town, gradually uncovering a sinister plot that threatens what's left of mankind.\n\nMuch of the game is played like most other RPGs of its time: the player navigates the party through the top-down world, fights enemies (which appear randomly in hostile areas) in turn-based style on combat screens represented by enemy pictures, acquires information, equipment, and items from NPCs in towns, etc. The player can create a whole party of adventurers and/or recruit some of the characters that populate the game's world.\n\nHowever, Wasteland also introduced an original skill system that has had a significant influence on the genre. The game makes use of the skill system in conjunction with traditional character attributes to achieve goals and get past obstacles. Beside helping the characters to fight more efficiently, main attributes sometimes have an impact on activities used outside of combat. For example, high strength can be applied to break a heavy object, charisma rating might influence the way NPCs interact with the main character, etc.\n\nThe skills work in a similar way: some of them improve the characters' proficiencies with different types of attacks and weapons, while others are needed to solve and/or by pass certain situations during interaction with the game's characters and objects. These skills are rather diverse, ranging from physical abilities such as swimming to more complex actions (medic, lock-picking), or even psychological states (confidence). Skill learning and progression depend on the main character's IQ rating.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Electronic Arts","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"57017197-e7c0-427e-9a48-bb069a835831.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"8896c39c-75f5-4934-a0b1-c54073b0bf0b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"411378ed-4501-4baa-a42b-cc5507993a85.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"8ca6a804-987e-450c-8c70-48f4c977102a.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"45642e45-8b27-4577-b459-04d0d09992a5.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"a792a0c5-430f-4981-8703-2148c32c18ba.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132721,"FileName":"da729b9f-c5c5-4089-80f3-202ed4a0b361.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175830,"Name":"Waterloo II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Waterloo II is a 2-player historical strategy wargame.\n\nBased upon the battle of Waterloo, the player controls British and Prussian forces against Napoleon's French forces.

Thanks to Data Trek the mystery is solved as you, the indomitable Willy Byte, explore the wonders of the Digital Dimension.

Simple enough, except for the dastardly Hex Luthor, embodiment of glitchness. Hex's static charges, overheating, and magnetism constantly menace your efforts, sometimes forcing you to drop everything and rush over to restart a ragged clock or, even worse, repair the power supply.

It was intended to be an easier game to solve than the typical Infocom release and provide a good introduction to interactive fiction for inexperienced players, and was very well received.\n\nThe player's character is a postal clerk in the small fishing village of Festeron. The cranky postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an important envelope to the proprietor of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. The proprietor in question, a kindly old lady, then asks the player to rescue her cat from a mysterious sorceress known only as The Evil One. Stepping out of the store, the player finds that quaint Festeron has mysteriously been transformed into a more sinister town called Witchville. There are but a few hours to defeat The Evil One. Fortunately, the player soon finds the Wishbringer, a magical stone that can grant seven wishes if a suitable object is used in conjunction. To see the future, for example, the player must be wearing glasses and holding the stone. The seven wishes that can be granted by the stone are for advice, darkness, flight, foresight, freedom, luck, and rain. Each wish can only be used once per game, and requires that the player possess some related object.\n\nA player can solve Wishbringer by using the wishing stone, then play it again without using it to get a higher score.[1] A few Infocom games have puzzles with multiple solutions (for example, the \"Loud Room\" from Zork).

Gameplay is divided into 3 distinct segments. The first segment is played from an overhead perspective on a large map of the two nations, players forces are displayed as small tiles on the screen. In the Atari version, the player has a large smoothly scrolling map, while the Apple II version breaks the map into 16 individual segments, which can be viewed separately. Character movement and commands are placed via text, and each player takes turns inputting 5 commands for their forces, followed by their opponent. Players control air, naval, infantry, and armored forces, and forces must be carefully supplied and managed. Commands are affected by troop morale, supplies, and terrain conditions.\n\nThe second segment involves political maneuvering. The player is in control of military movements, but also taxes and oil supplies. The player must protect oil supplies, and attempt to gain enemy land. The allocated resources are then used to purchase newer and more advances weapons and supplies from one of 24 foreign nations. Only allied nations will trade with players, and players can win over allies by supporting their diplomatic efforts, trade, and careful use of nuclear weaponry. More importantly, neutral nations must be won over to the player's cause for the final conflict.\n\nInevitably, this regional conflict will explode into global nuclear war between nations, based upon their allied status. Played upon a larger scale map of the eastern and western hemisphere, the player controls submarines, carriers, and air forces. The player can use nuclear and non-nuclear arms, and nuclear fallout is fatal to forces. If players use nuclear forces prodigiously, the world's level of radioactivity will rise to a point where both players lose. The ultimate goal is to subdue all hostile nations, and win World War III.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"John Bell","Publisher":"Crystalware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133309,"FileName":"d77cc643-dca3-416d-b733-4c6e6621f563.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133309,"FileName":"bd70654b-141e-4df8-b698-85a257b9d33c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":133309,"FileName":"8c39fba7-64db-4026-81db-1a42689fbcd5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133309,"FileName":"8fbfe778-18af-4788-a689-996db87d0164.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202285,"Name":"World's Greatest Bowling","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A 4 player bowling game from the early Apple II era.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMViD1IeYGo","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":null,"Publisher":null,"ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":202285,"FileName":"cddea6c1-ed0b-4050-9ae1-f35836d20d17.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202285,"FileName":"53c9b808-8267-4ec4-becc-1d05e75e3b0b.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133304,"Name":"Wrath of Denethenor","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"Wrath of Denethenor is a top-down fantasy role-playing game.

In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.\n\nXevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaAet0JV0yY","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Mindscape, Inc.","Publisher":"Mindscape, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133303,"FileName":"5be5326a-538f-4976-b8bc-4fe4dd3c2af6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133303,"FileName":"f6f8eec5-9de5-431a-a2d6-81dcc9240e7d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133303,"FileName":"8641dfb6-aad4-4daf-acaa-4ce933e575c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":133302,"Name":"Xyphus","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":null,"Genres":"","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Polarware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":133302,"FileName":"0a4f5ba0-f0e8-4419-afa4-7a5f1123f6af.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133302,"FileName":"828c2792-2bf8-45d7-b3d8-0abfcf34852c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133302,"FileName":"1e914ab7-249c-4225-965e-629e532a0356.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133302,"FileName":"3ef83125-f42a-493d-9646-8f144988eb92.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":133302,"FileName":"f153bb89-fe8f-4968-a655-82149738734f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":133302,"FileName":"0b27d1dc-8c24-467e-823f-fc2101ba236d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202284,"Name":"Yahtzee","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Yahtzee is a text-based implementation of the popular dice game for the Apple II.\n\nPlayers take turns rolling five dice, and the player can reroll any or all of the dice twice more before selecting their scoring category.

The player's goal in the wizard's realm is to avoid his capricious tricks and to learn to control his magic.\n\nZork II has two notoriously difficult puzzles: the Bank puzzle, in which the player must figure out how to walk through several bank walls in order to figure out how to get out of bank with the loot from the vault without tripping the security alarm; and the Oddly-Angled Room, a diamond-shaped room filed with panes of glass representing baseball bases. The player must figure out how to traverse the diamond in order to open a door that will lead to the game's finale.\n\nLike its predecessor, Zork II is essentially a treasure hunt.

The player must be wearing the amulet (found at the bottom of the lake), the cloak and hood (received when the player chooses to look under the hood of the vanquished opponent in the Land of Shadow rather than deal the final blow), the staff (received from the man at the Cliff for helping him retrieve the chest of valuables; attacking the man in any way or trying to take the valuables from him inevitably breaks the staff), the strange key (found in the Key Room when the player uses the grue repellent (from Zork II) to get past the dark places), the royal ring (retrieved from the Royal Museum by using the gold machine to travel back to the year 776 GUE), and the black book (found in the Royal Puzzle).\n\nUnlike Zork I and Zork II there is a time-sensitive event, an earthquake which is randomly triggered about 130 turns into gameplay. The player must retrieve the key before the earthquake (when the Aqueduct is broken, leaving no escape route from the Key Room) and can't complete the Royal Puzzle or retrieve the ring until after the earthquake (when the unopenable Great Door breaks). Also unlike the previous two Zork games, the lantern is of little relevance. It is needed only to walk through the dark areas of the Junction, Creepy Crawl and Foggy Room at the beginning of the game (often done after completing the Land of Shadow, Cliff, and Flathead Ocean—saying \"Hello, Sailor\" to the Viking yields an invisibility vial—tasks). Another light source, the torch from the Scenic Vista, is used to retrieve the repellent from Zork II and deposit it in the Damp Passage via the teleportation table to provide a light source for the return journey after retrieving the key.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXyq4YrCoAc","Platform":"Apple II","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Infocom, Inc.","Publisher":"Infocom, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":132250,"FileName":"d0cd11eb-cbb5-49bd-bb49-675360a9de7f.jpg","Type":"Arcade - Controls Information","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132250,"FileName":"659e9bbb-612d-415e-80b6-b94eef3cee40.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132250,"FileName":"01eae1f8-43a5-4930-a37a-52e40d386bd3.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":132250,"FileName":"fc7cd089-c8a2-4b94-8237-edc48006569e.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":132250,"FileName":"25453f86-a6c8-4934-b43a-4cb0a36d8155.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164975,"Name":"Zork Quest: Assault on Egreth Castle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The Egreth Castle, once the royal abode of the proud king Duncanthrax, has now become a terrifying, haunted place.
