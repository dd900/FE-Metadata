The driving element of the gameplay is to stay unnoticed. If guards spot you, you don't have much chance in combat, unless you are armed with appropriate weapons, which aren't easily acquired. Snake can use a variety of weapons and gadgets to help him survive during his mission. He can also hide behind objects, punch guards, and crawl. From time to time he'll have to participate in boss battles, where stealth won't help any more.","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1990-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yphNwuAGBr4","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_2:_Solid_Snake"},"26944":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Parallax","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"22fb4a78-2191-4b37-ae91-069977ff2699.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7de172a1-50b3-44cd-9010-858e05e2cc87.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"275f2567-add0-4cd3-953a-ccad4b9217e4.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"0b983feb-e13f-469c-842f-a9338acb1a27.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3d67c13d-53e8-4e40-a614-6c934be050b2.png","Region":"Asia","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"AKIN","Overview":"At a certain point in time and space, man has become immortal.

She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole.\n\nPentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart.\n\nThey lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro's own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death.\n\nHis cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him. After overcoming numerous hazards amid the lava caverns, underground passageways and rivers, he managed to escape; not even the raging opposition from the island inhabitants who, fearful of the wrath of the Emperor, tried to keep Pentaro at any price, could hold him.\n\nIt did not take him long to realize that the unknown place from which he had just escaped was actually located on an island, thanks to the map he had gotten during his confinement. He himself could hardly have imagined how useful it would turn out to be one day...\n\nPentaro will have to escape from the island if he wants to meet up with his beloved Lucytesse ever again.

Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\".\n\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\n\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\n\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\n\nLike Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\n\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"33318":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"D.O.

The protagonist is contacted by the bodhisattva Akasagarbha (known as Kokūzō in Japan, from the Chinese Xukongzang), who tells him that the world is in danger: the king of demons is trying to locate and neutralize the holy Ashes of Buddha, whose power protects the eight worlds. The hero's task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.\n\nOne of Enix's works that were unreleased outside of Japan, Gandhara is an action RPG with rather simple gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through hostile top-down areas, fighting constantly respawning enemies with sword or magical spells. Rations must be bought in order to keep the hero alive. Defeated enemies grant the protagonist experience points; once a certain amount of those is accumulated, the hero levels up and grows stronger.","Publisher":"Enix","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"33786":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Compile","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"8420a1cf-9450-4340-86bf-dfb6de1eb94f.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f62833e-00c4-4a51-9d2c-ccb447cc06e8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5a50c02f-5fc2-4ca9-aa49-892401ff3f95.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"d2798d9c-1b08-419e-84f9-1af3696aed55.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d3e11cec-fbdc-452a-9a0b-75ae1a8f126a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Puyo Puyo","Overview":"The main game of Puyo Puyo is played against at least one opponent, computer or human. The game itself has three modes, Single Puyo Puyo, Double Puyo Puyo, and Endless Puyo Puyo. In Single mode, the player takes on the role of Arle Nadja, a 16-year-old female spellcaster that has the pleasure of foiling Satan's plans. Satan wishes to take over the world, and Arle stands in his way. Arle must first however battle her way through 12 opponents before facing Satan, and unlike Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, with the exception of Rulue, they are not under Satan's control, nor were they created by him (for Rulue, she fell in love with him). Once Arle has beaten Satan, the world is saved, so she can return home. As in all main Puyo games, the story mode consists of playing Puyo matches against a fixed sequence of characters in one of three courses. In Double mode, two players play against each other. In exactly the same fashion as before, by out-chaining one another, the player tries to fill up their opponent's grid. Since the rules of sending so many garbage blocks made games short-lived, no matter how many chains are sent, Compile added the rule of Sousai in Puyo Puyo TSU and onwards. This lets players counter opponents' attacks with chains of their own, sending any garbage blocks back to them as a result of overflow. In endless mode, the player must continually match puyos to get the highest score they can. In Mission mode, the player must complete 52 missions requiring the Puyos on the field to be eliminated by using limited pieces","Publisher":"Tokuma Shoten Intermedia Inc","ReleaseDate":"1991-10-25T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"33790":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes"},{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer 6: The legend of Heroes"},{"AlternateName":"Dragon Slayer VI : The legend of Heroes"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Nihon Falcom","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"39893c99-2b80-4fee-a4b8-4b563f6deb2b.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f009f783-4a54-4b49-a8c4-7f206390ad9d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2b15d18a-290f-42f3-9376-d30c471459cb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"33808267-b0f2-4da8-8073-deaf65d516ac.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"63864152-2fdb-4b68-811e-968eadc7ae1d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu","Overview":"Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes tells the story of a young prince named Selios.

Even though it is directly connected to the more serious Xak storyline, Fray has a less serious tone and light-hearted comedic approach to telling the story. It was originally released for the MSX2 and was later ported to several different systems, among them MSX turbo R, PC-9801, PC Engine (as Fray CD), and Game Gear.\nFray is a simple action RPG. The game proceeds by the player's character Fray fighting through a preset overhead view map shooting opposing monsters, jumping over obstacles, and locating powerups and Gold, the game's currency, along the way. At the end of each stage the player will fight a boss and enter a town or safe haven where the player can purchase new equipment, hit points and the option to save their progress.

This time it’s a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually won’t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, you’ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.\n\nNinja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.\n\nThe levels (called “scenes” in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels you’ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.","Publisher":"HAL Laboratory","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=D0KjTOKHx7E"},"33856":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Nyancle Racing"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bit2","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Racing","Images":[{"FileName":"48edd1f8-8873-4f66-b672-1451f425aeb0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ad910630-50f9-4744-94ce-7dab5105ad0c.jpg","Region":"Asia","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"b8b19665-ca6a-4601-95de-0265d43f7783.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nyancle","Publisher":"Panasoft","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?time_continue=208&v=_ZOrG7E_RiY"},"33858":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"A Ressha de Ikou MSX","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"ArtDink","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Construction and Management Simulation","Images":[{"FileName":"0f35ff54-4e38-469d-afcc-c7fd3578d9a6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"59a0a342-8ea6-4874-ac69-ffe54497d3a2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"5df2a614-d653-4c8f-8e09-e2c7a7116027.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"1afb4b69-e064-4508-a52e-3faaa78c34d9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Fanart - Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"3784d861-7b1c-425b-b935-1252b0f279eb.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"A Ressha De Ikou","Overview":"A Ressha de Ikou is the first in the long-running transport network simulation series mostly known as A-Train.\n\nThe player controls a railroad company CEO in the end of the nineteenth century, who was entrusted by the president of an unnamed country to build a railroad that reaches its Western coast.

Except as Lila (now promoted to Lieutenant) points out in the intro, why send in the Supernatural SWAT squad to deal with common terrorists? As the Chief reveals, they've found strange creatures in sewers - creatures not of this world, but from Hades (the other dimension in the first game), meaning whoever was behind the previous crisis is behind this one. What survivors remain are barricading themselves indoors. The city has been cordoned off and Lila is the prime candidate for the mission. So off she sets, with four fellow S-SWAT members, to regain control.\n\nThis sequel has undergone radical changes from the original, with all of the RPG trappings stripped out. There's no longer any kind of stats, menu system to navigate, day\/night cycle, overworld map, or weapon recovery items. In fact the only items are drugs, which restore health to maximum and only one can be carried at a time, and key items with further the story. The biggest (and arguably best) change is the combat: there are no longer any random battles. Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time. If there's something hostile in a new area, you can see his health bar at the bottom.\n\nIn a lot of ways it closely resembles the original Metal Gear, except more sedate and with greater emphasis on NPC dialogue.","Publisher":"Victor Interactive Software","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"33862":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fun Project","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ceaa0020-4972-46a9-a278-4e3f76748857.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"59eb1e89-6d8b-4258-9ed8-5533d769b993.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"856fa702-5d0a-4b4c-9fdb-ad24beeafa97.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Back"},{"FileName":"638edb0f-d1ca-4543-b91e-1c4468bce3d0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"aa7bc5f4-5321-4985-9eba-0dc7a912e346.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e15dae18-6bbf-4c32-ac0b-7424b718d626.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cfa6138a-12a0-4829-b885-827266f7e5a0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9c27985d-ba03-431f-92b3-f3f6708c898f.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c5746a72-bb8c-4ac6-a06c-720d42d5305a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Shiryou Sensen: War of The Dead","Overview":"Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...\n\nShiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down \"world map\": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. \n\nThe goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day\/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CtaKjYvuueQ"},"33864":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Taito","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"55e537e6-f42b-4f03-a8c1-c04495cb0dd8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"61dc0deb-1ca9-4a95-971f-e7f8a4ea5423.png","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"9ce0adc8-a6fd-41df-a559-845f62f04390.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7289cc9c-7dbd-4d39-bbec-1db095f0721f.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9b570675-7293-4f2b-a396-be44daecb56b.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"284d6806-897a-472a-a956-3d3d23ef74ef.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"8afd6920-4b4a-468a-b72b-9219f8360587.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"d6f5b11a-0401-4d81-b13c-a4e978b2fd58.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Arkanoid II: Revenge of Doh","Overview":"Revenge of Doh is a direct sequel to the original arcade smash Arkanoid.

Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.\n\n[Personal Reasons For Remembering]\nReally loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SuhzEiTkz7Q"},"33919":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MSX Area","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"99c121c5-8429-4373-b20b-8ed29ab0fc18.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"27ec6cbd-0aae-441e-a96c-d7949768c3f3.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Booming Boy","Overview":"Booming Boy features all the components required that will make you enjoy as a classic Japanese arcade game in the first half of the 80's.Place as many bombs as you can, destroy all the obstacles in order to find the hidden power-ups and eliminate your enemies quickly before time runs out. 5 areas consisting of 5 stages with a lot of enemies plus bosses.

However time has passed and the magic that sealed the dragon away is weakening. The Drasle family decides that it's time to destroy the dragon once and for all. However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns. The Drasle family decides to take on this quest, and will use every member of the family in order to accomplish it.\nThe player chooses a character from among five different members of the Drasle family. The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.\n\nThe object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.","Publisher":"Nihon Falcom","ReleaseDate":"1987-07-09T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b2731_esV_c","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Legacy_of_the_Wizard"},"33998":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bit2","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"1c7aa2cd-50cf-4a17-a81b-e746231630d6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5548913c-9112-407a-9350-72c0be60b354.png","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5f3c22df-6ae7-4314-ab04-011bc866ff41.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - 3D"},{"FileName":"1354a02d-e3d5-4214-899b-8d2e91651151.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"f13b378f-1811-4a7a-ab57-3d63ab396443.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"bfdf6b5b-7273-49aa-a896-211ec65a7717.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3ac790b7-694f-4db1-8d86-2efba0ca82f5.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Famicle Parodic","Overview":"Shoot and bomb your way around in this Xevious-style shooter for the MSX2.","Publisher":"Bit2","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zWbsIUlTqQk"},"33999":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"NCS","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"8e7f269e-8297-4660-a6f8-0f03ab59a995.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"f52037be-21fc-48ec-89ed-b9d0af54bdb8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"affd96be-e01c-450c-9f3a-dade0c1bc4a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"05acab7f-ea8f-4cca-bf60-1be04ca587b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Elthlead","Overview":"Elthlead is notable for being the first fantasy SLG game ever developed.

Among the magic spells is a fire attack, a time-stopping spell, and a transformation ability that allows Adol to pass for a monster and converse with enemies.

The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state. The game's designer, graphic designer, and music composer, Tomo Furukawa, would go on to become the vocalist of the band Guniw Tools.The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship \"evolves\" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987},"34059":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Konami","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"9bd2d563-9e7f-4d33-b25f-3e8e4ef8531a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"0d83575d-247d-49d6-8a91-1b2730a95b31.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"e2c7bbcc-c35c-4a08-8131-b32b382d5daa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"96f75b3a-993c-446d-a1b7-f79a6f4f9dbb.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b371ce2-10f8-4444-bc60-c9fb141c3591.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"48411fc3-9bbe-4655-bae1-403739595738.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"50c32ccf-6eb9-490b-a94d-465ebc4ab2c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background"},{"FileName":"3ace833b-ee46-4a6e-bcd6-843b2be00c71.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8bca3553-7684-4c57-9bd0-3ed6fc702f4a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aea944b3-2847-4ab3-b72f-1d09f60fa95d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"8cddcb33-aa40-46e1-a715-43cccbae8bc7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Snatcher","Overview":"Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence.

Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called \"Snatchers\" because they \"snatch\" their victims before they take their place.\n\nA new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed.

Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — is it a person or a snatcher?\n\nThe player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.\n\nDuring key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian.

The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes\/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs\/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.\n\nThe player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.\n\nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.

The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.","Publisher":"Taito","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9byzIPKhKs8","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bubble_Bobble"},"107041":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Capcom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9c967499-86be-45a7-a588-4ccd830bebde.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"b0d434c4-b598-41be-977d-d3d209c2984f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"1e586fad-490f-4217-a252-55997b3e6e7c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e007aa5e-1b12-47ae-b7c7-4386c9969c85.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"fe5bfc76-94ff-4ef9-bc4a-3647070848dd.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fd8d04f0-5dad-4711-b8bf-f9ea4d756bfc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9fe675b1-5fd8-4bad-b4c8-fbcb8fd46ecc.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":1942,"Overview":"1942 is a vertically scrolling shooter for one or two players.

With a larger number of units the player has a distinct advantage in overpowering the enemy forces. Likewise, each unit is stronger (or weaker) when facing other units of differing types.

In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.\n\nThis strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"124288":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sony","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"c5266c26-4365-4e55-b032-1c27a6caf4f3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"634498cf-6683-4141-8963-384f41517642.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e370445-45bc-4bce-ae8f-039398fbb115.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"95d93137-41e4-4724-bad4-d4cacff7bce0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3edba09c-83d2-4107-bc79-7b74bc27bf71.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"8f145f41-f862-43d6-89f2-eb419c29d32d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Jansei","Overview":"Jansei is a Board game, developed and published by Sony, which was released in Japan in 1986.","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"124289":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Andromeda Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy; Board Game","Images":[{"FileName":"91143da9-fabd-4c17-88db-643c5402cd9e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"04cc7114-9656-4d24-9376-0b8e182f541b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"278b8482-808c-4541-bc85-41f9f5411b4b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"f97b9d7c-aa02-4b67-872c-ce4af88632fa.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a52e6875-71ee-428c-be77-c7fe776ceb6c.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Kempelen Chess","Overview":"Kempelen Chess is a computer chess game with a top-down view but with a 3D-feel.

Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nPlayers begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4q6AmYh-RgE"},"124383":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SystemSoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"7676e5c9-e4c5-4476-80a4-71c043755f2d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7732ecbf-ccfb-446c-a8af-00ebf04166c3.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8999b213-64a4-4212-952f-0b2a864b04ea.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5bb28d2b-52ec-4053-926f-2f2c4c7c3a9d.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"4f8e0130-2cb3-4bdc-9b5a-bdbf0a8c2ba2.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"c3508b47-b085-4356-92c8-eb0416c8c209.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"4c4c6a93-858d-4f2a-92ef-9da3dab1d20d.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"63a1495b-0960-49b2-befe-5d7d85ff42b5.png","Region":"World","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ogre","Overview":"Ogre is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson's board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers.

The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.\n\nThe game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. \n\nDifferent units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-nQvb81uXuc","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daisenryaku"},"124561":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Super Load Runner"}],"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Irem","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Platform","Images":[{"FileName":"4fe8f1e1-3db8-4037-b7a7-b8cb41aad0f9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"803520e1-116e-4f25-a616-a033537c7458.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"23713362-acd0-4745-adcf-c6065e074b99.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"3884ac42-1dee-4c76-90e3-55b8d4afbe0a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"5e7de7f4-18e4-4141-b5dd-c695a364502b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5992df18-7c7f-42bd-b74b-6e37f61e5c3d.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c6058227-ab9e-4789-a28e-0a2dae7554ca.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Super Lode Runner","Overview":"Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan, following the original arcade games release.

The player must make careful judgements and use their limited time wisely to find and hook the largest marlin they can before the competition ends.\n\nIn order to catch anything, the player must choose one of several regions of sea in which to fish.

At this point, the player must use the gauge above the screen to maneuver themselves and reel the fish on the line. Each fish is judged on its size and play resumes.\n\nThe first game based on the Tsurikichi Sanpei license, Blue Marlin Hen was released on the NES and the MSX around the same time in 1988.

This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=l1B867WP9KQ","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultima_III:_Exodus"},"124874":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Urusei Yatsura"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e5b47e4c-9333-44fa-bbc4-c42251ed4008.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"79bb3fd6-1da0-4e7e-b3c5-184ad2aada34.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3eff1066-8cf2-4ad5-9da1-0007f1234984.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"83c3aa81-b210-491a-89c0-59d27902e0ea.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"7ee28dc8-8cef-4039-a3b6-650565aadcd3.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"b77aec49-50fd-4570-8db6-0553f650bcc6.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Urusei Yatsura: Koi no Survival Birthday","Overview":"The scenario in the game is the same as in the anime. We get and invitation to Okiko birthday party. The person who finds her first is going to get a kiss, so a fierce competition among the invited guests ensues. The mansion is a maze with lots of traps laid about. The characters are carefully transferred from the anime so it's needed to know the original to get the most of fun. It's possible either to go the shortest way or to eliminate all the other competitors, so it can be considered multiple-branch story. The ending also depends on how other characters are dealt with so it's multiple endings as well. The system is command selection, but the number of commands is quite large, so the difficulty level is really high. In the early visual novels years lots of works were clinging desperately to the popularity of anime franchises, but this work is really well done and it shows how a game can be better in many elements than the original anime.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1987,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Urusei_Yatsura#Other_media"},"124875":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Taito","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"323792c1-4640-450f-a95b-339eb6b7d078.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c0781490-1dde-46d0-bd11-d7de49dc028d.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"fffd866f-41cd-44af-ae6a-5c235b4d451e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"7aec07fa-5bcb-4d6a-825b-fc2463355dc5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"9fa533a5-6c65-4fb4-b847-814481a8c7fe.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a3883f14-dcda-4853-b4b9-ce0bc88c4178.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Victorious Nine II: Koukou Yakyuu Hen","Overview":"Victorious Nine II is a baseball game where you can pitch, hit, field, and run just like in a real baseball game.

Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.\n\nThe first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with Ultima and Might & Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.\n\nThe player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements.

There are inbuilt trees which can't be played through, and dynamite sticks which can clear large sections of earthing at a time.","Publisher":"Methodic Solutions","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QTvf3huJsUA"},"127338":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Manbow II"},{"AlternateName":"Space Manbow 2"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Manbow 2 Team","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"37d1174a-7cfd-4970-8947-eba062537898.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"365ea57b-8126-441c-840c-8a28c771b1d8.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"2eecba22-056a-410b-8829-68f2d233c573.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"73206b93-fffa-46d0-8bd6-3fedfc5bc21e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Manbow 2","Overview":"Manbow 2 is a 2007 unofficial homebrewed\/fanmade sequel to the MSX2 classic Space Manbow.","Publisher":"Manbow 2 Team","ReleaseType":"Homebrew","ReleaseYear":2007,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Uz5yUFKrMhI"},"132364":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ａ列車で行こう","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pony Canyon","Images":[{"FileName":"ac52ae24-bd3d-4f5d-aa98-3603e49da5c9.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5a3e96d0-58d0-4f07-9dc8-17d9adba4743.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"0cd0a726-72be-4d9c-93e0-d3a13bbf7f08.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Let's Take The A Train","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"132764":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bothtec","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"633688b1-82d3-414d-ae25-5c8e0b2fc6bb.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"bc39bcc9-542e-479a-9b06-9af21d1fc4f9.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b9b59de2-f67c-4f3c-a151-0f37b749bc0c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"8523131d-02d7-4ae2-accd-c566db68e2ef.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"574e6b76-0a76-421b-a301-e4ad995655e5.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"8588ab56-6026-4c0e-8b08-aae2d8f2a12c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"c441acd5-1362-4386-ab20-2281f61a5ee5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Relics","Overview":"Relics is an action-adventure game where players take the role of a spirit who can possess different characters.

Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. \"When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come...\" And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins. \nFinal Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names.\nIn the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price.\nSpells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons & Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.","Publisher":"Squaresoft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AoccumWjZkM","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)"},"138297":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Paragon Productions","Genres":"Action; Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ac32298a-f431-4620-b669-d68711c099e1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4d4b3c7c-9617-46c0-b714-727f85dd653d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Bomberman 2","Overview":"Bomberman 2 is a Bomberman clone, right down to the name, for the MSX2.

The power-up system is rather big and unlike that of Hudson, including items that make you invisible, invert directions, slow-downs and most of all money. The standard fare of extra bombs and extra firepower, however, is not so common, and you have a limited amount of bombs to drop. Most levels make use of special tiles such as teleports and tiles that can only be crossed in one direction. The levels have to be cleared on time, and the allotment is so small that a thorough strategy is needed to reach the exit without wasting time on monsters or superfluous bonuses.

Each level is composed of a number of tiles and every one has a part of a pipe (straight or angular) on it - except one which is just a black hole. In one tile a red ball starts rolling and all tiles it rolls through become blank.\n\nThe goal of each level is to let the ball roll through all pipe parts without meeting the hole or a blank tile. To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.","Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"151298":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MSX Engine","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b96e4805-37b5-4663-a472-d57af295dfe4.png","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"af3c13f6-52ca-40f2-b2a9-6c860da9e296.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"ae8f4cf5-98c8-4c11-99fe-4abb113d05d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"DIX","Overview":"Dix is an Puzzle game, developed and published by MSX Engine, which was released in Japan in 1992.","Publisher":"MSX Engine"},"151299":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MSX Engine","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b84ccf6c-420a-4928-ac66-4d02e946c2f6.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8fdef565-0ede-4818-9239-cffc63656277.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"34e59c77-acff-42a0-8778-7f04fa730302.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Dizzy","Overview":"Dizzy is a puzzle game released by MSX Engine in 1992","Publisher":"MSX Engine"},"151314":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Idealogic","Images":[{"FileName":"5e0dc3f5-d43d-4d79-9eb2-8d9adde325b5.jpg","Region":"United States","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"33df6229-837f-429b-88cc-554e62048d45.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"31805738-72f3-485c-8e10-d4098bb8488f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Fahrenheit 451","Overview":"Based on Ray Bradbury's classic science fiction novel Fahrenheit 451.

Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes.\n\nAnother now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.\n\nThe opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.\n\nThe game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.","Publisher":"Tecno Soft","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-02T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Herzog_(video_game)"},"151358":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Hertz","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"9189e621-a2b8-4fcd-b8b9-a998208680e4.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e6bc3af4-6939-4933-b949-41d21a7bb5d5.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d8ac5c7e-c907-408f-b8a7-8e1a87bcb47a.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"eff7335a-b068-44d4-a66d-227bb534b569.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"33307002-02f6-4f3f-a581-29bacd4c1e44.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Hydefos","Publisher":"Hertz"},"151362":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Telarium","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"7d9ab029-4740-4deb-a99f-aa92844610c2.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"1f9d6b43-3455-440e-b2d8-80954a779b6f.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"La Isla Del Tesoro","Overview":"Jim Hawkins is a young boy working on \"Admiral Benbow\", his parent's inn. One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.\n\nTreasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.","Publisher":"Idealogic","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986},"151388":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Sadato Saneda","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"b0b5f522-660b-49c7-94e1-61a6b830749a.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"68686f77-aa15-47df-85e6-8f8d2eaef757.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"55a011f8-dd53-4cc7-90ee-85d3aa71d00f.png","Region":"Europe","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kinetic Connection","Overview":"Kinetic Connection is a puzzle game.

The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.\n\nGates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.","Publisher":"StarCraft"},"151550":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Family Soft Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"c6869048-3000-4921-9f10-90ae9feefc43.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"7d417223-87df-46e0-bc1c-861935c7a090.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"70d7fb45-700b-4f11-ad64-5387d824051e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"cd1d64c2-5ffa-4cec-bda0-a7bf09324b07.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"af4ac9a4-31ba-4cfa-b82c-8a5a04ded96e.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"MS Field Mobile Suit Gundam","Publisher":"Family Soft Co., Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"151551":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Wolf Team","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"eda5d478-c51e-47a5-87ad-80ffef7d6b80.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"53ce82d3-8942-4dca-9b45-e507acb2bc2a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"64f6374d-9251-44d5-99dd-d11d526035da.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Niko 2","Publisher":"Wolf Team"},"151552":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Idealogic","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"bb238a60-5a93-4ed3-9fb0-d826cdb6f11a.jpg","Region":"Spain","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"7ddea232-32eb-403f-a1b2-67b4a47c6260.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"50242f67-2eed-49e5-a618-242c24542131.png","Region":"Spain","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Nueve Principes en Amber","Overview":"The single-player adventure is controlled via typed keyboard commands.

The game field is made of a uniform \"five by five\" grid. Playing cards are dropped from the top of the field and fill up these empty spaces. When a row, a column or a diagonal of five cards is filled, the game awards the player points for creating poker hands (card combinations) such as pairs, straights or flushes. The goal of the game is to gain the maximum amount of points and maybe achieve a perfect Clear.

It is a direct sequel to Xak: The Art of Visual Stage (Xak I). The game was released in Japan only, but due to an MSX scene that arose in Europe (predominately in the Netherlands region) some of the MSX versions of Xak received fan translations. An enhanced remake was later released for the NEC PC-Engine, together with the first game in the series Xak as Xak I & II by Telenet Japan's development team Riot.\n\nXak II, being a direct sequel to the first game in the series, it features the same high fantasy setting as Xak. The gods' division of the world into Xak, the world of men, Oceanity, the world faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons, as referenced in Xak, is depicted in this game's introduction. In this adventure, the main hero of the Xak series, Latok Kart is exploring a vast region situated around a single central village of Banuwa.\n\nIn Xak, the protagonist Latok Kart fought and defeated the demon Zemu Badu. One of Badu's minions escaped, a black-robed man known only as Necromancer. Three years later, Necromancer is able to contact one of his allies from the demon world of Xexis: a fearsome demon called Zamu Gospel. Following a prophecy foretold by an ancient and extremely powerful sorcerer by the name of Amadok, the Necromancer and three other demons (referred to as Demonlords) are attempting to complete a dark ritual which will revive Zamu Gospel into the world of Xak.\n\nThe player once again controls Latok, now nineteen years of age. A rumour about the whereabouts of Latok's father Dork has surfaced around the village of Banuwa. Latok and his faerie companion Pixie travel to the village to investigate, but soon run into Gospel's minions.

An English translation of Xak: The Art of Visual Stage was also released in 2007 on the now-defunct retro gaming service WOOMB.net, and is now to become available on Project EGG.\n\nXak: The Art of Visual Stage features a typical high fantasy setting. According to the game world's legends, a great war was fought between the benevolent but weakening ancient gods and a demon race, which led to the collapse and eventual mortality of the gods. After this 'War of Sealing', the gods divided the world into three parts: Xak, the world of humans, Oceanity, the world of faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons. The demon world of Xexis was tightly sealed from the other two worlds as to prevent reentry of the warmongering demon race. Some demons were left behind in Xak, however, and others managed to discover a separate means to enter Xak from Xexis anyway. This ancient history is displayed in the introduction of Xak II.\n\nOne of them, Badu, was a very powerful demon, able to use coercive magic to make humans do his bidding. Duel, the god of war, managed to defeat Badu and seal him away in a mountain of ice for 250 years. The god later settled in a village known as Fearless to live out the rest of his mortal life.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Badu's prison is broken. Demons overrun parts of Xak once again. In order to stop the ravaging of his lands, the King of Wavis sends a messenger faerie to Dork Kart, a famous warrior living in the village of Fearless. Dork, however, has gone missing. The player takes on the role of Latok Kart, Dork's 16-year-old son, as he meets the messenger faerie, Pixie. Latok embarks on the King's quest to slay Badu, hoping to find his father along the way.\n\nIn his travels, Latok is guided by Duel's spirit. Over the course of the game, it turns out that Dork and thus Latok is a descendant of Duel.","Publisher":"Microcabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"152002":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Ninja Dexter"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Falcon","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"fd817656-8e25-4dc3-b8b7-0bf3041dca0f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"cf810f3e-0ca6-4676-bfda-fb9dad9a053b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"61f01b7c-cf3e-4190-8bf1-709134731a31.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Youma Kourin","Overview":"Once upon a time, in the Edo era (1603-1868), one girl received marriage proposals from three different men.

Latok hears rumors about a man who looks exactly like him and was last seen near an old tower infested by monsters, which nobody dares enter. Latok and his girlfriend Fray arrive at the tower entrance and meet their friends there. Latok decides to venture into the tower with just one companion, unaware of the fact that the \"false Latok\" was just a trap set by powerful demons, intended to lure him into the den of evil.\n\nXak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel is a side-story in the Xak universe. It differs from the main Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991,"WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Xak:_The_Tower_of_Gazzel"},"152281":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"T&E Soft","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"651df1cb-437e-4e9b-bd82-d54808d88f0b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"f9573a14-918b-4fd0-b490-1793130f2d0d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"391c215a-b4e0-45cd-8800-4033b09f5135.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"209c2d49-fb95-41e8-948d-15fd9b56b4e0.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Rune Worth: The Young Noble of a Wire-Puller","Publisher":"T&E Soft"},"152502":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Parallax","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"f1074538-206e-4a79-8465-c281227a1cc6.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5cbed633-210c-4d12-971f-51187a05dd5d.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"55301940-e14c-450a-9b70-4b0c4727d024.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Magnar","Publisher":"Parallax Labs"},"152520":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"T&E Soft","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"ccfc9a3b-0efb-47c2-b1f2-7147fa5b6b59.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"832546bd-6861-4f51-8aee-677f844a6842.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"bf45fff4-1bd2-4993-9757-4b4be035f542.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Hydlide","Overview":"Hydlide (ハイドライド, Haidoraido) is a 1984 open world action role-playing video game developed and published by T&E Soft.

Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the land.\n\nDragon Knight marked the beginning of Elf's erotic RPG series. The game is played entirely from a first-person perspective. In the town, you move around by selecting destinations from a menu. Once you enter the tower, you navigate your character through 3D mazes, fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. Enemies in the game are scantily clad, attractive young women; there are also several scenes with explicit nudity.","Publisher":"Elf Co.

All went well in this peaceful place, until the evil witch Mesaana abducted some of the country's lovely inhabitants and placed a curse upon them, turning them into hideous monsters. Enter Takeru Yamato (whom you might know as Desmond, the hero of Knights of Xentar), a young adventurer who happens to be in Strawberry Fields at that time. Takeru is told that in order to remove the curse one has to find three sacred writings, buried deep within three dangerous dungeons. Looks like a job for our adventurer - especially because the rescued girls will probably be very grateful!\n\nDragon Knight II is the predecessor to Knights of Xentar, the only Dragon Knight game that was ever translated into English. This is a first-person game that is mainly dedicated to dungeon exploring. Takeru has to explore the three dungeons, fighting enemies and sometimes talking to dungeon inhabitants. The enemies are the girls who were turned into monsters by Mesaana. In town, Takeru can also buy weapons, armor, and items, and talk to various people.","Publisher":"Elf Co.

One day, the Quiz king gives his son a pet dragon which the prince soon becomes very fond of. Unfortunately, his girlfriend is not equally fond of losing his attention, so she takes the dragon and leaves, intending to abandon it in a far-off place, so that it may never return and contend for her prince's love. Thus, the prince sets off to find his girlfriend and his pet dragon, somewhere in the Quiz kingdom.\n\nDuring his quest, the prince meets both friends and foes and lots of monsters. However, since this story is set in the Quiz kingdom, the battles are not fought using the usual RPG formula of weapons and magic spells. Instead, the monsters pose trivia questions which the player must answer. The prince loses hit points if a wrong answer is given. Getting the answer right awards the player with money, with which it is possible to buy equipment or lodge to regain health. Some adversaries won't let the prince pass unless he has made enough correct answers, which means that the player's quiz prowess is somewhat equivalent to experience points in normal RPGs.\n\nThe questions range from linguistic matters (usually questions about Hiroshima dialect) and game trivia to technical matters or the Thunderbirds.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"156352":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"エメラルドドラゴン","Region":"Japan"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Glodia","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"60885b7e-05ec-4c48-9851-56823825a6c4.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e81741c7-53f9-4595-8bdd-f0174048bff8.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"e8ba8b64-fe6d-49df-973e-cf2d73fe8f1b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"1b569e69-c322-46cc-a8de-b955a03c9109.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Emerald Dragon","Overview":"In Emerald Dragon the player takes control of Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World.

The first game starts as the little Arle attempts to graduate from her magic school by conquering the evil Satan tower. The second game jumps forward in time to a 16-year old Arle, now an accomplished magician, who must escape a dungeon and defeat those that imprisoned her. The third and final game in the package faces Arle off against an evil sorceress that aims to avenge the deeds Arle did on Satan tower back in the first game. She must now escape a dungeon and defeat the evil minotaur that has been sent to destroy her.\n\nAll three games share the same engine and gameplay mechanics, playing as first-person RPGs in which your main view is composed of a 2.5D view of the dungeons you are trapped in, and the rest of the interface is used to give graphic feedback to the player instead of relying on stats and numbers (for instance, a picture of Arle serves as the means of telling how damaged she is, and a group of gems that encircle the screen show how closer you are to advancing a level). Combat is turn-based and involves selecting and casting spells to obliterate the many baddies in the dungeon. There's also a fair amount of puzzle solving and plenty of NPCs to run across in each dungeon, all being characters from the Puyo Puyo series.","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"156384":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Gainax","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"236b81f5-5c67-4bf2-b6ae-fdfa2cf68695.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0a34142f-7249-41d6-a8fa-c33dc74d40ce.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Mighty Battle Skin Panic","Publisher":"Gainax","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"156470":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"f4a87261-424d-4ed8-b747-8eb3b60d2589.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"0d9befae-743d-44db-8879-f2663ad83afb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The Tower of Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"162289":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Genres":"Puzzle","Name":"Gitahei","ReleaseYear":1986},"163014":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Momonoki House","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Role-Playing; Quiz","Images":[{"FileName":"5a1bf2d2-557e-417b-82a2-ccae53b61035.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"de09c8b5-75ab-4234-a9ef-3a5418db4bd0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"45f19dfd-5ca5-43b2-b980-01d34d46e99e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"192e7598-bcc3-4210-bf93-5d7e64ce4b33.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"6fa77de3-1965-46d5-8107-44215646416b.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df6b0284-c647-4fc6-b381-22eac6801c43.png","Region":"Japan","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Peach Up: Issue 1","Publisher":"Momonoki House","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/VXg2UtntJQk"},"166649":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"e14980e7-76cb-4c01-9cb8-11422139a49b.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3aa862f4-3272-40cc-bc2a-00292851d79c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"3a28aaf4-edf0-4b6e-944e-3028855d90ff.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Knight Lore Remake","Overview":"An updated version of the original classic.

People from all over the world came to see the subterranean wonders of the huge cave system. But this came to an end when an alien super-being was awakened by an exploration on one of Neptune's moons. Angrily, the super-being directed his eyes to Earth and took up residence in \"Eindeloos\" and turned it into a fortress. The super-being then took a form of a mystic heart and went back to slumber. The player now has to descend with a helicopter in \"Eindeloos\" to defeat the super-being and its hordes. The player has control over a helicopter in a multidirectional perspective. While the player is exploring the immense caves, it is very important not to be hit by the many moving obstacles such as mines, scroll tracks and energy wires. Also the enemies, who resemble winking skulls (and can take different forms) will attack the player. Fortunately, they can be destroyed with the fire button of your joystick or you can lure them so that they fly up against the obstacles. To continue, the player can change the direction of the funnels and doors by pressing on levers and arrows with the space bar. If you use the spacebar on an exclamation mark, you can continue from the exclamation mark after a crash. The player starts the game with 14 helicopters.","Publisher":"RadarSoft","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R4i2XerD3ac","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/www.generation-msx.nl\/software\/radarsoft\/eindeloos\/2963\/"},"167716":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Anma","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"be8c1dfe-6932-401c-a444-27fc935b97bf.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"e1b63a30-7727-444c-9cf4-d45f0cd3e8e8.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"168e8a4a-7e9e-4bcb-a537-a9738bd56259.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"2de648c7-785a-42d9-97c8-086353829955.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"95755c1c-a922-4b32-b575-dac67c089ddf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"24c9dbdb-2261-49ff-ae5c-c173df217718.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ea798831-8ab6-41ab-a854-482c877dcda2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"c1493732-66a0-4c4b-8971-d08a0c749723.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Frantic","Publisher":"Anma","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Qunqc8n4dV0"},"167859":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Radarsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"e4e3af8d-bb41-4bac-9236-81927a2b8a39.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front"},{"FileName":"7136b0a1-93f4-418d-a074-0856a6409359.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"10a881ba-3e85-4701-9041-299875664958.jpg","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c93dc96f-5196-4ffb-92ad-82b412ea876f.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over"},{"FileName":"5b7c38e0-9440-4b3c-b9a1-4e58da204eaf.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"},{"FileName":"b89b6076-1012-4947-99f2-eb1e4e230f3f.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d3a83aa5-3241-4f3f-b8aa-b4daa91cb0ca.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"16336153-d43c-427b-9fb9-c6242140782f.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"29821a04-4add-439a-a6d1-479706689b44.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"82759b9c-4371-4250-8473-87aa3ae07bb4.png","Region":"The Netherlands","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"De Grotten van Oberon","Overview":"MSX 2 Version. The Caves of Oberon is a puzzle game that takes place in a large cave system on Oberon, one of the moons of Uranus. The caves hold knowledge of a long extinct culture and the aim of the game is simply to discover all of that knowledge. The player is in control of a saucer-like spaceship that is controlled from a side view perspective. Interaction with objects in the world, such as computers, sensors, fuel tanks and radars, is done by directing a beam onto them. To progress through the caves it is necessary to unlock doors by interacting with computers. The player is then given a puzzle that has to be solved, for example a math problem where the correct missing number has to be entered or a word with a letter missing. While moving around it is necessary to avoid bumping into the cave walls since the ship will take damage and when it is destroyed the game is over. Fuel is also limited and it is necessary to refuel at the fuel tanks.","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1986,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m7Oz9QW3ExE","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/www.generation-msx.nl\/software\/radarsoft\/de-grotten-van-oberon\/2583\/"},"167860":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Impact Soft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"093f5cdc-1755-4644-b127-cb05b1403c40.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"abcfe1ab-a1d8-408a-9e27-bf51b08f7b5d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"6b6ce9d0-c5a4-4fdc-bbcd-e212af023b64.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Haradius","Publisher":"Impact Soft","ReleaseDate":"1991-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KKIwhG5WyQk","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/www.generation-msx.nl\/software\/impact-soft\/haradius\/3627\/"},"167882":{"Cooperative":"true","Developer":"Boh-Ken","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"dcf0707d-2c31-4e33-9693-7f0ee571a159.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"39fa4562-754b-43c3-bc72-79fb47b4e43a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"2559c38c-23d3-4ea1-a7ba-9a1c8721fe64.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"a99b56b1-aafa-4588-87d1-f1ab95bee10d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"76c20623-4c45-4b2b-9eb5-5e1cf3d67543.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"KPI Ball","Overview":"Pang Clone","Publisher":"Club Hnostar","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":2000,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=591UUlSgfxw"},"168011":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Methodic Solutions","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"622dc1b0-f9f5-486e-bc56-2f03f269c59f.jpg","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"93757f58-ca26-4de6-be61-b9f34138839e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"1afadcc3-766f-4f5c-9e7d-ed33c680702e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"51464eb1-71a7-4633-90e8-7f95f692f03f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"6242c739-a9b3-4bf6-9731-0b4ec30306ea.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"9f03da17-f90a-4b5b-ba74-97a1a4b678b8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"aa09155f-bc64-4e4b-826e-f3142bc9a329.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Leather Skirts","Overview":"The game is played in a maze in which leather skirts must be collected.

However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base. Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.","Publisher":"Paragon Productions","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Vm2CwvegBDs","WikipediaURL":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rick_Dangerous"},"168367":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Paragon Productions","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"5048129b-7125-4b99-b75f-300556365816.jpg","Region":"Europe","Type":"Box -

There are 3 modes, which are Opzoeken (Look up), Overhoring (Quiz), Het Stedenspel (The City Game), and 4 difficulty levels. In Look Up mode you can type names of a city or river and the game will point it out on the map. In Quiz mode, the game will point at a randomly selected place and the player must type in the name within the time limit. The input is very strict, if the player makes a typo and misspells even just one letter it is considered incorrect.\n\nThe helicopter mode is the main part of the game. In this mode the game randomly displays the name of a city or location, and the player controls a helicopter which must fly to that location before the time runs out.

The list of commands, however, is fairly long, and includes (beside the standard \"Examine\", \"Talk\", and \"Go\") also verbs for taking objects, using items, affirmative and negative responses during certain dialogues, as well as the unique commands \"Fight\" and \"Rescue\". Each of these commands can be combined with a person or an object displayed on-screen by highlighting it.\n\nAt certain points during the story Blon-Win and her allies will have to fight enemies.

Rarely used options such as answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" during dialogues or the command \"Rescue\" have been eliminated.","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"186754":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"JAST Co., Ltd.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure; Visual Novel","Images":[{"FileName":"5c0941a8-710e-40b4-b486-371f8b899f12.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8b4442c2-cfd5-4b5f-af85-503c093ee8a8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"216ed257-e1d8-4ac8-a7d2-53a5f8096567.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Cosmos Club","Overview":"Cosmos Club is an Adventure game, developed and published by Jast, which was released in Japan in 1989.","Publisher":"Jast","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"186755":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Family Soft","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"d0018d51-0ea6-47dd-804f-8cb5c8206279.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c6ddbf4b-c82d-4e5c-9472-b2a6892d1de7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5947f65a-b4b0-409c-b64f-0d20c3b9f407.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"MSX Train","Overview":"MSX Train is a Action\/Collection of Mini games, developed and published by Family Soft, which was released in Japan in 1992","Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1993},"186756":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Family Soft","Genres":"Action; Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"3e70b06d-7f26-48de-a911-918ad25e739f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Banner"},{"FileName":"eafc16b5-6602-4f97-9bf8-1afb642cb1ff.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"3e8efb48-b926-489a-8fff-15c3b5a7ca61.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"87968077-db9d-4e0a-adba-3a51de677e18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"MSX Train 2","Overview":"MSX Train 2 is an Action-Adventure \/ Collection of Mini-Games, developed and published by Family Soft, which was released in Japan in 1993","Publisher":"Family Soft","ReleaseDate":"1993-10-01T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"186757":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Dual Targets: The 4th Unit Act.3"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Data West","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"ee922034-2297-4833-af07-2de049e982a6.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"b2a94520-60f4-42c4-89c2-cd005590473a.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"05e05829-3295-4f48-86ad-68db62475e7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"df70b49d-6b00-49dc-a37e-e15f72d82bf9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"The 4th Unit Act.3: Dual Targets","Overview":"Three months have passed since the destruction of the oceanic base of the criminal organization WWWF.

The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses (\"happy\", \"angry\", etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between \"Rescue\", \"Think\", and \"Fight\" commands during the storyline.

The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.\n\nAfter the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.\n\nBattles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"186761":{"AlternateNames":[{"AlternateName":"Lodoss-Tou Senki: Fukujinzuke"},{"AlternateName":"Record of Lodoss War Pack"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Genres":"Action; Puzzle; Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"794ae1f9-e937-41c0-ae61-9ac266e3f40f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"a222a49d-fd8b-455b-a07b-0602e066a300.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ca921fdf-45c0-46cc-a1c9-4cc4c4a0d523.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"8c50cd5b-c46a-4acc-9d22-8cff0c50573c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a0b4d41f-adb0-47b0-94eb-3114f65cc607.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Record of Lodoss War: Fukujinzuke","Overview":"Fukujinzuke has little to do with the Japanese pickled vegetables it was named after.

With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.\n\nCan Can Bunny Spirits is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors.

In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl's preferences and of the character's statistics.

Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von Müsel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.\n\nThe game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven.

The player usually takes control of a \"home planet\", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map.

The players navigates the units (space ships of different kinds) on the top-down map in turn-based fashion, attacking or defending against enemy ships. The ship encounters are automatic and displayed as small animated cut-scenes. There are more ship types than the previous game, more different animations during battles, and detailed characteristics and portraits for various generals fighting for the two states.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189013":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bothtec, Inc.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"10de92f5-7020-4805-a810-6166de9c5925.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d1ca08e3-cf2a-4f4b-92f8-cb8756c7111c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"d2184f0d-406e-4520-a45a-5de36d8c5f3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu II DX Kit","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1991},"189014":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fairy Tale","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"cc5c5b44-0456-4391-b452-2ff197ab93a7.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Bishoujo Daizukan","Publisher":"Fairy Tale","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1992},"189015":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Micronet","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"6bfbe764-0cd4-4eb2-aea9-e3cc8152b00e.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0f86a2c0-cbe3-4804-8039-5b0aa5566aeb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"fe9488cf-5ce4-43bb-bcc2-60752ec8c16b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gokudo Jintori","Publisher":"Micronet","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1988},"189016":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","Genres":"Sports","Images":[{"FileName":"e35f2617-818c-462f-ada5-5009d8596642.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"10f8b4d3-521f-4f43-8213-2ef2f863c509.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"48800074-d40d-4b42-b069-96436936173d.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5fe0b766-af14-4161-ab9e-8010d1cf670a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"5946ac7c-6640-479a-93e3-ad3cfb01ff30.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"The Golf","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"189017":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"DOTT Plan","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"4f3e7f66-47eb-4bc3-9afc-3cf88b418856.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"404bf256-2819-4b30-bed2-18b40f5bf666.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"262bb723-405d-411a-a047-b1ffaaa3b5fe.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ff3e3215-ab8e-4513-b8f1-70f0c337817e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gram Cats","Publisher":"DOTT Plan","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1989},"189018":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"MicroProse Software, Inc.","Genres":"Flight Simulator","Images":[{"FileName":"d360f236-fe82-4722-b237-71a3ff95772f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"656a0ec6-156a-4a07-ae32-f2a61626e551.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"62e07146-1817-455c-adc1-22e7a8efde3e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"4aad504f-c086-49b3-920c-a4b0d3de56a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Gunship","Overview":"Gunship depicts one of the Western world's finest attack helicopters: The AH-64A Apache.

Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match).\n\nThere is also a \"construction set\" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.","Publisher":"ASCII Corporation","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"189035":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"8a8f951f-3533-464a-bf33-46f0088a2a35.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"5d26fa28-80e8-49cc-b4e5-288dd33becf9.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"d4ff78b2-be9e-47f3-8e88-b2a67b23ceac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"14ea2458-7393-4216-a2ed-0abca5c63a8f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"JB Harold no Jikenbo #2: Manhattan Requiem","Overview":"A 24-year-old woman was found dead in her flat in Manhattan, New York.

As an adventure game, it has Japanese influences (no inventory, no puzzles), as well as Western ones (relative freedom in navigation, detailed dialogue system, no \"trigger commands\" to advance the plot). The game plays similarly to a real investigation: the player has to question suspects, collect evidence, find new leads, after which new locations become accessible.

The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called \"The Great Disaster\". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...\n\nThe Joker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player must explore the town and talk to its inhabitants in order to advance the story and get to the bottom of the mystery.\n\nThe game has scenes with nudity and rather mild depictions of sexual situations.","Publisher":"Birdy Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189040":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Birdy Soft","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"2a0ad7a9-511b-420a-ac9b-46d1f3035ddb.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"29346bcd-ecd4-40e3-8b84-210cfd13593e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"86343459-2223-4b8f-9a12-c9b5d82f5fe5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Joker II","Overview":"Joker II continues the story that started in The Joker.

The same nightmare pursues him: he sees his sweetheart Laura calling for him, begging him to save her... Wild has to rebuild his life from scratch, but this nightmare ties him to his past... so he ventures out to look for answers once again.\n\nGameplay-wise, Joker II is pretty much identical to its predecessor. It is a Japanese-style adventure without puzzles, but with more interaction and exploration possibilities than it is usually the case with games of its genre. Graphically the game also looks very similarly; since most of it takes place in the same locations, many images were simply transferred from the first game.\n\nLike its predecessor, Joker II has several scenes with nudity and mild sexual situations.","Publisher":"Birdy Soft","ReleaseDate":"1992-09-04T00:00:00-07:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189041":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Heart Soft","Genres":"Role-Playing","Images":[{"FileName":"89de0f80-6180-471f-8007-29e58f7d503f.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"5b20e636-46ea-40ce-8287-16fa6d3e88f0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"d6c4bea5-3e2d-4a85-bc79-466c941805d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kagerou Meikyuu","Publisher":"Heart Soft","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1990},"189042":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Panther Software","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"b8cc3e3d-24f5-4062-8920-fdb9cc8fcd3b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"c5fe245a-1bb1-4438-a0bd-27960fccfe90.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kami no Machi","Publisher":"Panther Software","ReleaseDate":"1989-12-06T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189043":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Riverhill Soft Inc.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d1dfb725-6700-4072-a2c7-fc1b702522a0.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"73a723d8-149e-475c-af36-a5204003caaa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"848cc36d-16f6-49b6-8a16-cd95bc5db549.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Kohakuiro no Yuigon","Overview":"Kohakuiro no Yuigon (\"Amber Testament\") is the first in the row of detective games starring the fictional Japanese private investigator Ryūnosuke Tōdō.

The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective.

There are no separate battles where the player inputs active orders; instead, the player can opt to change the movement trajectory or tactics of a ship, watching the events unfold when the turn is over. The interface is entirely menu-driven and occupies a large portion of the screen; two other windows are dedicated to the map of the star cluster and visual depictions of ships and their battles.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-16T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"189089":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"055db869-b2ba-46b6-a1ea-c84e93c8b136.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Back"},{"FileName":"2500b7af-707b-4db9-8077-0437af2b018b.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"3648b5b0-f6fd-4bc6-aa98-c69ea443432c.jpg","Region":"Japan","Type":"Disc"},{"FileName":"5d4f4e75-ddca-4c6c-9d3b-81c969592b78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"ab72b593-684f-44dd-9dc5-dd61e7c353be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Schwarzschild II: Teikoku no Haishin","Overview":"Teikoku no Haishin is a sequel to Kyōran no Ginga: Schwarzschild.
