One night he sits at home and stares at the moon. Suddenly, the magic fairy Ariko appears in front of him and gives him... no, this time not the Magic Book, but a Magic Crescent! With the help of this crescent, the hero can turn into totally different young men - which will naturally increase his chances in impressing girls and ultimately having sex with them.\n\nCan Can Bunny Spirits is much less of an adventure and more of a strategy game than its predecessors. Success depends even more on the preparations before the actual decisive stage. There is also extensive customization in this game. In the beginning, the hero chooses what he wants to be like, which includes age, height, blood type, and other parameters. Then Ariko introduces several girls to him, of which he has to choose one. Afterwards, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving the right answers, combining knowledge of the girl's preferences and of the character's statistics. Each girl has a \"love meter that can be raised or lowered depending on the player's strategies, and once it is full, the hero can have his way with the girl.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure; Strategy","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188847,"FileName":"f9b5079a-a1ea-4a2d-9679-d2473ade64ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188847,"FileName":"d39d605a-642d-4c8a-9a3b-d50f32411851.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188847,"FileName":"4f18b04e-db2e-468e-a4d6-e87132da0259.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188848,"Name":"Can Can Bunny Superior","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The second game in the Can Can Bunny series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi.

The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Cocktail Soft","Publisher":"Cocktail Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-16T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188848,"FileName":"f42a1c3e-115f-46fb-a434-2b047ea56029.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188848,"FileName":"e3b45c56-b353-43fd-bb22-9ab4a9445630.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188848,"FileName":"608d9ea9-bb0d-443b-8577-f153c77fb105.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188848,"FileName":"b2919531-8f51-41bc-b232-6259f994407c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188849,"Name":"Canvas of a Tear","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"User Side","Publisher":"TAKERU","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188849,"FileName":"f5d2cdd4-9d77-4c25-b399-5d27387ddfdd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188849,"FileName":"47a6b3d9-2fbc-4a5f-a0b0-c92940c51b42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188850,"Name":"Casablanca ni Ai o: Satsujinsha wa Jikuu o Koete","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The year is 1945.

Columns of three different symbols (such as differently-colored jewels) appear, one at a time, at the top of the well and fall to the bottom, landing either on the floor or on top of previously-fallen \"Columns\".\n\nWhile a column is falling, the player can move it left and right, and can also cycle the positions of the symbols within it.\n\nIf, after a column has fallen, there are three or more of the same symbols connected in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, those symbols disappear. The pile of columns then settles under gravity. If this causes three or more other symbols to become aligned, they also disappear and the pile settles again. This process repeats as many times as necessary. It is not uncommon for this to happen three or four times in a row - it often happens by accident when the well is becoming crowded. If the well fills beyond the top of the screen, the game ends.\n\nOccasionally, a special column called the Magic Jewel appears. The Magic Jewel flashes with different colors and when it lands, it destroys all the jewels with the same color as the one underneath it.\n\nLike Tetris, the columns fall at a faster rate as the player progresses. The goal of the game is to play for as long as possible before the well fills up with symbols.\n\nSome ports of the game offer alternate game modes as well. \"Flash columns\" involves mining their way through a set number of lines to get to a flashing jewel at the bottom. \"Doubles\" allows two players work together in the same well. \"Time trial\" involves racking up as many points as possible within the time limit.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"c6cc65cf-4dc7-4b0f-a4c6-8e325aa777aa.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"42addb28-e64c-4174-bc22-06afd63849f1.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"3b945c90-ee5c-4f50-9a5a-49235946570f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"808f1f9a-feb2-4da0-a326-d1707cc450b4.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"2c3bc65e-5d21-46ef-9e07-66e4ead082d6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"259afe93-c1fb-4510-a9be-f16f4e32e04e.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"8c76e5f3-7c4e-4f48-a10c-e19f26aa6057.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33307,"FileName":"28acd400-9ba7-409f-be90-774170adc999.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167652,"Name":"Conqueror","ReleaseYear":"1992","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Taracot","Publisher":"Taracot","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167652,"FileName":"8e0784d7-cca6-44d0-bed7-acb1e31585e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":167652,"FileName":"87d0acb3-677a-4a31-a6e4-38bab028c32b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":167652,"FileName":"4c6da34b-22f9-47ae-a0e4-09456beddcb8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":167652,"FileName":"75864b8a-3995-4ccb-80d6-55c699cc9781.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"World"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167653,"Name":"Construction Craze","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmZNURll-mA","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Construction and Management Simulation","Developer":"Paragon Productions","Publisher":"Paragon Productions","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":167653,"FileName":"53241cdc-54fe-4925-9e90-7674b59d8ad4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167653,"FileName":"1e30b902-57d7-47dd-bbd2-205d78b7cdcc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167653,"FileName":"1ddf8c59-7fdc-4810-8dd9-9dde2e3ce9cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"World"},{"DatabaseID":167653,"FileName":"4c3dd345-4ec1-4a0f-811b-0bc0f29e46e2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167653,"FileName":"7993afd0-6331-458d-a303-4c24329e519e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":167653,"FileName":"cc3bbb6c-7cc5-4e19-b698-a68d7634084b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":31625,"Name":"Contra","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The universe teeters on the brink of total annihilation at the hands of the vile alien warmonger, Red Falcon.

The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.\nAll of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state. The game's designer, graphic designer, and music composer, Tomo Furukawa, would go on to become the vocalist of the band Guniw Tools.The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship \"evolves\" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Hudson Soft","Publisher":"Hudson Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34034,"FileName":"6e2c39a1-b375-4440-9766-d46119d419b2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34034,"FileName":"eb879c60-2382-45db-9f65-cd64bc320837.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34034,"FileName":"88022320-c76c-44b3-a3f3-a3ce1312aae6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34034,"FileName":"802be585-e927-483b-babe-75f6f7a34310.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34034,"FileName":"00beafe3-14d7-4820-9a15-887e29648cd1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34034,"FileName":"21a8dffb-5e3a-4538-91e5-2cccd7669511.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":167859,"Name":"De Grotten van Oberon","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":"MSX 2 Version.

To ensure this, the player can move the parts while using the hole as buffer. So, as example, if the player clicks on a tile which is a few tiles away from the hole, all tiles between the clicked tile and the hole are moved by one towards the hole. Then the hole is at the place where the player clicked on. At the start of a puzzle, rolling out of the level boundaries is also deadly, but after a certain amount of tiles are cleared the ball comes out at the opposite side of the playfield.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Brøderbund Japan Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151297,"FileName":"c151a064-641a-4480-9732-0e9253fb267d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":151297,"FileName":"409b02a7-b417-43ba-a8ce-0d20a99b84fb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151297,"FileName":"88fbc64d-b84b-438c-b2c1-9c992058d209.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":151297,"FileName":"22330f7e-341f-4f87-be31-8cdb7eb44662.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188894,"Name":"Dios","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Zainsoft","Publisher":"Zainsoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":188894,"FileName":"54300f71-bca8-4e21-87d5-7cb35cbd281d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188894,"FileName":"df325ba5-4664-42da-a1bf-95db33558671.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188894,"FileName":"11b35301-b9f4-48ab-8325-2d88d61a4ba3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34129,"Name":"DIRES: giger・loop","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"DIRES (Digital Image Real-Time Energy Simulation) giger・loop is a 3D action game in which players steer aircraft and need to topple poles.

The hero's life meter (called \"vitality\" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZlSC5An3ys","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Namco","Publisher":"Namco","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"289ffab3-e08e-464a-80d4-6547cf15d36c.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"46962886-9a1b-4221-ac5d-38072463630f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"ac60da0f-54c7-4d4a-8e23-ab8a2ba3e2cf.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"253029e5-c648-4e19-8e32-cbf108e32109.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"d373ad57-4484-48ea-90bf-8f4142626bdf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"40c5b8d6-fc1a-494f-973c-1010dda6c973.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34128,"FileName":"dff550a2-6e90-419c-a5b3-b0ca9efbec60.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":188898,"Name":"Dragon City X","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"One day hero is taken to a different world.

Some adversaries won't let the prince pass unless he has made enough correct answers, which means that the player's quiz prowess is somewhat equivalent to experience points in normal RPGs.\n\nThe questions range from linguistic matters (usually questions about Hiroshima dialect) and game trivia to technical matters or the Thunderbirds.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156351,"FileName":"bffb2e94-4c5a-47b7-9b5f-aa39b02b734f.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156351,"FileName":"77b0c1fa-6693-462c-a525-f8e3ab1651ac.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":156351,"AlternateName":"ドラゴンクイズ","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":33938,"Name":"Dragon Slayer IV: Drasle Family","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Long ago, an evil dragon named Keela was imprisoned inside a magical dungeon.

To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. \n\nThe druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. \n\nOn his way, the druid finds many shops.

Angrily, the super-being directed his eyes to Earth and took up residence in \"Eindeloos\" and turned it into a fortress. The super-being then took a form of a mystic heart and went back to slumber. The player now has to descend with a helicopter in \"Eindeloos\" to defeat the super-being and its hordes. The player has control over a helicopter in a multidirectional perspective. While the player is exploring the immense caves, it is very important not to be hit by the many moving obstacles such as mines, scroll tracks and energy wires. Also the enemies, who resemble winking skulls (and can take different forms) will attack the player. Fortunately, they can be destroyed with the fire button of your joystick or you can lure them so that they fly up against the obstacles. To continue, the player can change the direction of the funnels and doors by pressing on levers and arrows with the space bar. If you use the spacebar on an exclamation mark, you can continue from the exclamation mark after a crash.

A rain of well placed blows can produce a quick knockout, but normally you must hit your opponent many times before he goes down.\n\nThe game has three play modes. There is training mode to train your player before you enter a tournament. A ranking mode where you can select one of the three championships, Rookie, Japan and World. Each championship can be played at five difficulty levels. The third mode is the tournament mode. To reach the number one spot in the ranking or tournament mode you must train your boxer well.\n\nBefore you start you must create your character and set his initial abilities, strength, speed and stamina. Each won bout increases these abilities slightly. The abilities of your opponent and you are visible in the status bar at the top of the screen during the game. Strength is represented with a boxing glove, speed with a shoe and stamina with a dumb bell.\n\nThis game can be played by one player against the computer or by two players against each other. A password is given after each won bout and it enables you to continue with the next match in a tournament at a later time.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akMW_JhNNbQ","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Wood Place","Publisher":"Sony","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34002,"FileName":"ff501107-9cc7-4e7f-a4bf-a90c83a1c96f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34002,"FileName":"348e7990-4d95-40b6-801e-f1c06a5829ce.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34002,"FileName":"7fd626a9-2d43-4b74-aed0-8905d3b59c8a.png","Type":"Cart - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34002,"FileName":"b18dfc3c-746f-47a6-baad-4127822ec9cd.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34002,"FileName":"4e1c994c-b7cd-428b-b75c-1b1550659028.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34002,"FileName":"8e804dec-0b2c-4ba4-a794-9bd5759a7369.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150160,"Name":"Family Stadium Pro Baseball: Homerun Contest","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Namcot","Publisher":"Namcot","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":150160,"FileName":"c46494ac-1971-4205-a972-18b68669fe4c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150160,"FileName":"7e1c6714-43bf-4db9-acdd-f9ea543d653c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150160,"FileName":"9fdcfc02-8c89-491b-9032-1195ff3656db.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150160,"FileName":"d14d26b2-caad-4f04-bc2e-74719cb5fb6d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150161,"Name":"Family Stadium Professional Baseball","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Namcot","Publisher":"Namcot","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":150161,"FileName":"e2444676-c662-4cc6-ba70-80cba48012b3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150161,"FileName":"700d99d4-d0de-453d-a138-627872035a94.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150161,"FileName":"32d87d61-ea36-4a0d-b0d7-5eac2b0e2c61.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":119872,"Name":"Fantasy Zone II: The Tears of Opa Opa","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Opa-Opa is at it again in this zany return to his original homeland some ten years later.

Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. \"When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come...\" And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil knight Garland, and then the real journey begins. \nFinal Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. He also gives the characters names.\nIn the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run). Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price.\nSpells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up Dungeons & Dragons-style spell slots, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoccumWjZkM","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin Corp.","Publisher":"Squaresoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"3edb768c-ab2e-4209-9bb8-4ea10cef5e67.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"57b8c28e-44cd-46a5-b940-83d360e8875e.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"c8cbfe98-d7d8-4ac3-a3c6-62164ce8d3cd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"caeb67ef-361a-4bf7-8ef4-09269e5bd2d5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"3da448a4-486d-4576-b34b-a579afda6128.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"06f9aa47-872e-4c43-9257-4b466a8506fa.png","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"f902ebb0-0991-4c18-b92d-66f2c5eb0ce8.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":135135,"FileName":"4b92988b-a822-45b9-bb44-25738623419b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123934,"Name":"Final Mystery: Murder Club","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Final Mystery: Murder Club is an adventure game with simulation elements.

At the end of each stage the player will fight a boss and enter a town or safe haven where the player can purchase new equipment, hit points and the option to save their progress.

Karakuri Douchuu is the first Ganbare Goemon game in a long-running series known in the West as The Legend of Mystical Ninja. The game establishes many of the most identifiable aspects of the series: The top-down, 3/4 perspective; Goemon's use of a pipe and a yoyo as weapons; buying items in stores with found money, such as armor and health replenishing items; the 3D maze sequences; and the \"lucky cat\" Maneki Neko power-ups that increase the power of Goemon's weapon.\n\nThe goal of each stage in Karakuri Douchuu is to find three passes. These allow Goemon to pass the gates to the next area of the game and can be found in secret tunnels, in the 3D mazes that can be reached from some shops or purchased in said shops for a considerable fee. All the while, Goemon needs to avoid or defeat enemies such as samurai, policemen, ronin, ninjas and oni.\n\nThough an obvious progenitor to the series, it wouldn't be until the second game - which introduces Ganbare Goemon's trademark bizarre sense of humor and Goemon's partner Ebisumaru - that the Ganbare Goemon series becomes whole.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1987-02-25T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"f8327099-f29c-4fd6-a521-848f22511015.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"bc0f6d7f-c1b2-4b8b-b57c-761c994d17e4.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"c9646baf-f99a-4c0b-bcad-dcf6658c8b60.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"598693a1-75e0-4aad-82ab-463ee9a12de2.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"1de4108e-96e8-48ce-87e6-16543752a09c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"9c49824b-3177-4497-9eb2-e1a657608228.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"7c4130fa-8278-4443-a5ba-8e9c5fe21e86.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"e50899f6-8f69-44e7-be9b-a0d53407c269.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33842,"FileName":"10c337f8-b5f3-4592-90f5-09c5a9fcf658.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33842,"AlternateName":"Persevere Goemon!: A Tricky Journey","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":33781,"Name":"Gandhara","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Gandhara refers to the capital of the Kushan Empire, (today's Pakistan and Afghanistan), founded in 1st century BC, whose rulers were Buddhists; it was one of the most flourishing Buddhist states in history.

The protagonist is contacted by the bodhisattva Akasagarbha (known as Kokūzō in Japan, from the Chinese Xukongzang), who tells him that the world is in danger: the king of demons is trying to locate and neutralize the holy Ashes of Buddha, whose power protects the eight worlds. The hero's task is to find the ashes and defeat whomever the king of demons might send to stop him.\n\nOne of Enix's works that were unreleased outside of Japan, Gandhara is an action RPG with rather simple gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through hostile top-down areas, fighting constantly respawning enemies with sword or magical spells. Rations must be bought in order to keep the hero alive.

There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around \"historical\" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.\n\nThe combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually takes control of a \"home planet\", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map. Enemies typically appear after a few turns; depending on the goal, the player must prevent them from invading planets, destroy them, have his own ships invade a planet, etc.\n\nThe space ships come in different flavors: high-speed battle ships, cruisers, supply ships, etc. Each ship has different mobility, attack range, weapons, defense parameters, etc. Actual combat is displayed on a separate screen and is automatic. The player usually has a choice to use different weapons (cannons, missiles, etc.) against the enemy ships.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Bothtec, Inc.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1989-11-09T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189011,"FileName":"6421bf03-1e1d-4fc5-96d7-3f30d5f7f927.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189011,"FileName":"44a7821e-3488-41ab-975b-a67ecdf57fcd.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189011,"FileName":"cd788fe3-c0d0-4018-89d8-c46ad44ce770.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189011,"FileName":"ef2e2467-bad2-4af5-992c-777eb0285050.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189011,"FileName":"b55ada7b-4bf7-485d-9531-569be98ffe79.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189012,"Name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu II","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The second game in the series based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's Legend of the Galactic Heroes novels. The novels (and the games) are set in a futuristic world, where humanity has conquered the entire Milky Way and split into two powerful warring states, each encompassing different systems and planets: the Galactic Empire (modeled after Bismark's 19th century Prussia), and the democratic Free Planets Alliance.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to its predecessor: the player selects a scenario and tries to fulfill the victory requirements it imposes. There are five possible scenarios in the game. Unlike the first game, there is an option to choose which space fleet to control (Imperial or Alliance) for each scenario. The player takes control of planets allied with the chosen state. It is possible to deploy an entire fleet of a planet into the battle, or have it supply separate units. The players navigates the units (space ships of different kinds) on the top-down map in turn-based fashion, attacking or defending against enemy ships. The ship encounters are automatic and displayed as small animated cut-scenes. There are more ship types than the previous game, more different animations during battles, and detailed characteristics and portraits for various generals fighting for the two states.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Bothtec, Inc.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189012,"FileName":"489f2e9c-cdc1-41e9-b93a-04a4a424f7ef.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189012,"FileName":"d8317398-a295-4d30-96c9-4707b1c9c7b0.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189012,"FileName":"2fb03ca8-eb54-46e8-b745-1cb69a35e299.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189012,"FileName":"e5ad103a-b08d-4b72-977d-fbc7d594e1f2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189013,"Name":"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu II DX Kit","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Bothtec, Inc.","Publisher":"Bothtec, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189013,"FileName":"10de92f5-7020-4805-a810-6166de9c5925.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189013,"FileName":"d1ca08e3-cf2a-4f4b-92f8-cb8756c7111c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189013,"FileName":"d2184f0d-406e-4520-a45a-5de36d8c5f3d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":179789,"Name":"Girl's Control","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Bishoujo Control is a shoot'em up from HARD.

Some of these monsters do less damage than others, and take more damage themselves. You can either attack them yourself using your weapons or spells, or make your companions attack the monsters themselves. When defeated, most monsters will either leave behind some coins, which you can spend to buy stuff at the towns, or some items, which you can also use to defeat monsters.\n\nHowever, not all inhabitants are monsters.

Unlike the common RTS game, the playfield is a long vertical stretch instead of the well-known map stretching in both X and Y axes.\n\nAnother now unique trait is that there is little emphasis on building up a base to produce units which are then directly commanded into action. Instead, a base is already located at each end of the path, and the player is given control over a hovering battlemech. New units are bought using funds accumulated during play. These units, ranging from single foot soldiers to tanks and AA batteries, advance from the home base towards the enemy base. The player may pick up a single unit (or five soldiers) and move them closer to the enemy base in order to speed up the attack. A radar on the top of the screen gives an overlook of the battlefield.\n\nThe opposing faction has got the same resources, and the enemy battlemech will make raids towards your base, forcing you into mech-on-mech battle. This element turns Herzog into a rather unique blend of strategy and shoot'em up.\n\nThe game takes place in a balkanised region, where the last war has given birth to a new state, called Ruth. A military coup d'état in the now-independent state leads to a new war, which the peace-loving Mercies must win.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Tecno Soft","Publisher":"Tecno Soft","ReleaseDate":"1988-02-02T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":151357,"FileName":"11fb08f3-1c84-405a-a82a-f6d4ebee9967.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151357,"FileName":"09b42a86-ef5e-42d4-84c3-ac9fe188e9e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151357,"FileName":"69d04432-dc76-4f5f-a529-11c82e59664e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":123976,"Name":"Hi no tori Hououhen","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Based on the \"Ho-o\" (or \"Karma\" volume) of Osamu Tezuka's famous manga Hi no tori (or \"Phoenix\"), \"Hi no tori Hououhen\" is a vertically-scrolling shooting game where Gaou's goal is to locate the mystical phoenix across 6 stages of labyrinths, enemies and various other obstacles.

The player advances by examining objects, talking to people, and unlocking new locations.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Elf Co., Ltd.","Publisher":"Elf Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":"1992-02-17T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":188901,"FileName":"859b903d-8200-460a-89e9-e0c227d1ce39.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":188901,"FileName":"a053e9b7-ddc7-4ce8-81b3-1a11d9a7a22e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":188901,"FileName":"5dd568da-7098-4831-a02b-f1bdc16d4933.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151391,"Name":"La Abadía del Crimen Remake","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"La abadía del crimen (The Abbey of Crime) is a computer video game programmed in 1987 by Paco Menéndez.

One day a sea captain named Billy Bones takes a room at the inn and stays for several months. A blind man called Pew arrives and shows something to Billy that gives him a heart attack. Jim witnesses everything and runs to aid the captain, who tells him about his sea chest and his relationship with Captain Flint, a famous pirate. After he dies Jim grabs the key dangling from the corpse and opens the dead captain's chest to collect the last payment. He finds a packet inside, and decides to take it to two aristocratic acquaintances of his, Dr. Livesey and Squire John Trelawney. They discover a diary and a treasure map, and decide to travel to the island in search of the booty.\n\nTreasure Island is a text adventure, an adaptation of the classic 1883 novel of the same name by Robert Louis Stevenson. Unlike the book, the game is written in a second-person perspective. Otherwise, it follows the original plot closely: the player assumes the role of Jim Hawkins, and has to perform the same actions as the character in the novel. This leads to a more claustrophobic design, as players without knowledge of the book have to guess what to do next. To help alleviate that problem, other characters act as some sort of built-in hint system. The player can ask them about anything and they will provide clues when these are available. The parser accepts most of Infocom's standard features like pronouns and chain commands.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Telarium","Publisher":"Idealogic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151362,"FileName":"7d9ab029-4740-4deb-a99f-aa92844610c2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":151362,"FileName":"1f9d6b43-3455-440e-b2d8-80954a779b6f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":115795,"Name":"Labyrinth","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The player starts this game off controlling the actions of an ordinary citizen on their way to a movie theater.

We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.\n\nLast Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.\n\nDungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"BrainGrey","Publisher":"BrainGrey","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"495887e7-5752-4ef4-af6f-54380c723382.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"3eca0d00-b7dd-43c1-9d55-f6721cf4449d.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"6bfb704f-470b-4774-9b1a-b1e50a7fe5d0.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"ad31bdd6-cd32-4223-a0b1-a9d5d418980b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"abace9fa-a32b-478f-afe9-a0a4735467bf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"f7e3a34b-47b7-428d-80d9-ee36e36bf09d.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"87688cc0-2890-4a74-bbcb-17c06b94ec15.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"5624e8df-381e-4731-b8e2-d4dba2278127.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189048,"FileName":"9f56e9a4-2d60-4335-a137-86fe7f8a4ca7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151427,"Name":"Last Mission, The","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Following a robot rebellion, humans have fled the Earth for the planet Nova.

The first game starts as the little Arle attempts to graduate from her magic school by conquering the evil Satan tower. The second game jumps forward in time to a 16-year old Arle, now an accomplished magician, who must escape a dungeon and defeat those that imprisoned her. The third and final game in the package faces Arle off against an evil sorceress that aims to avenge the deeds Arle did on Satan tower back in the first game. She must now escape a dungeon and defeat the evil minotaur that has been sent to destroy her.\n\nAll three games share the same engine and gameplay mechanics, playing as first-person RPGs in which your main view is composed of a 2.5D view of the dungeons you are trapped in, and the rest of the interface is used to give graphic feedback to the player instead of relying on stats and numbers (for instance, a picture of Arle serves as the means of telling how damaged she is, and a group of gems that encircle the screen show how closer you are to advancing a level). Combat is turn-based and involves selecting and casting spells to obliterate the many baddies in the dungeon.

The commands include the usual \"Look\", \"Talk\", and Move\" typical for Japanese adventures (no \"Think\" command), but also context-sensitive commands \"Eat\", \"Drink\", etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"0cf72c32-995f-49ee-96db-c082a59cfffc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"da5a2c19-43b0-4872-8fc5-284fb2a6fe57.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"84e9d1ca-cbbb-4b91-9e17-8c209906652e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"3df41caa-505b-4276-aa7f-fda8264772c6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"0789cb4a-fca4-4148-aa1c-95d29551922b.png","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"95cc89b8-631a-438b-8df5-2d6c80b6c4e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124298,"FileName":"8e7a68fe-114f-4be9-9944-6f5be196b162.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":124298,"AlternateName":"Maison Ikkoku: Kanketsuhen","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124298,"AlternateName":"Maison Ikkoku Final","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":168082,"Name":"Majin Kyu","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"XAIN Soft","Publisher":"XAIN Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168082,"FileName":"159aa2af-9303-4727-8243-9165a5f6a17d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":168082,"FileName":"57f586d6-5f62-4e40-8b39-2fd2e04ba61d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168082,"FileName":"6dd59775-6ae6-4985-84ba-21f3471271e6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168082,"FileName":"fc85e78f-65b4-4490-986c-f673764adefd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168082,"FileName":"2237ad5d-0972-461e-a770-00a18ed54e4b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":168082,"AlternateName":"魔神宮","Region":"Japan"}]},{"DatabaseID":189059,"Name":"Makai Fukkatsu","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Wing","Publisher":"Wing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189059,"FileName":"b0edfe5f-5953-44c4-9dec-e7a29209d1df.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189059,"FileName":"b612e9ed-8899-46b9-bcac-23b5acd514c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189059,"FileName":"ed6ab105-0278-4159-bd38-fa0bc6b76399.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151451,"Name":"Makyu Den","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Soft Studio Wing","Publisher":"Soft Studio Wing","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151451,"FileName":"ecb77696-d5a8-4d1f-8937-05fca415168e.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151451,"FileName":"ff672c77-60fd-4b1b-8031-5fc361579afa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151451,"FileName":"9d9a9f9b-2305-4829-b256-67904eb65e0c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34106,"Name":"Malaya No Hihou","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Malaya no Hihou is an Action/Adventure game, developed and published by Pony Canyon, which was released in Japan in 1989.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKQcwszS8Yg","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action;

He brings it to the old white dragon Yoshua, who tells him that a powerful protective artifact has been stolen, and the fateful hour has come to Akranis... with the help of his dragon Sarken, Kain has to restore peace and save Akranis and the dragon race.\n\nThe game is a rather unusual example of a side-scrolling action game, in which the player controls a dragon. Sarken is able to fly in any direction, but so are the enemies in the game, most of which are other dragons. The dragon has a HP bar which is depleted when he is damaged by enemy attacks or traps. Beside physically attacking, the dragon can also learn and cast offensive and protective magical spells.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Wolf Team","Publisher":"Wolf Team","ReleaseDate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33854,"FileName":"7ef67cf9-e9f1-4ff8-93ad-e0987d8cb8e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33854,"FileName":"1f348ecb-a75d-4399-8465-1044ea18fabe.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151529,"Name":"Might and Magic II: Gates to Another World","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The space traveler and rogue guardian Sheltem has left the world VARN, where he was pursued by the relentless Corak the Mysterious and a party of local adventurers helping him. The Gates to Another World eventually takes all of them to another world, known as CRON. There, a great turmoil is caused by Sheltem's actions, and the heroes must stop his madness, preventing him from casting the planet into its own sun.\n\nGates to Another World is the second installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Secret of the Inner Sanctum. Core gameplay is similar to predecessor, with the player creating a party of six characters and exploring vast first-person 3D environments, while fighting enemies in turn-based combat and leveling up. Unlike the first game, enemy encounters occur at set points rather than spawning randomly, though enemy type selection is still random.\n\nLike in the previous game, character classes rely each on a particular attribute to be effective. Knight, Paladin, Archer, Cleric, Sorcerer and Robber return, with the addition of two new classes, Ninja and Barbarian. Race selection features humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and half-orcs. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A new feature is the possibility to hire two non-player characters to travel with the party and participate in battles. A new skill system is introduced as well, allowing characters to learn such abilities as mountaineering (necessary to traverse mountains), linguist (for reading certain messages), cartographer (for creating an auto-map), and others.\n\nCompared to the first game, the sequel is more quest-oriented, with various characters in towns giving quests to the party, as opposed to purely exploration-based traveling in the predecessor. Time also plays a large role in this game, with some instances requiring the party to travel to different time periods. Characters also age as the game goes on; If the player waits too long, the characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging, and they will eventually die.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"New World Computing, Inc.","Publisher":"StarCraft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151529,"FileName":"422c15f2-1b94-41b9-97ae-120dc116dc0f.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151529,"FileName":"36cc349b-7931-4a2f-898f-d906143ddbb3.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151529,"FileName":"5d23718a-c04b-496d-8896-72557bdce102.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151529,"FileName":"75b80ad6-5a8a-4743-9d02-11e03a44ab56.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":156384,"Name":"Mighty Battle Skin Panic","ReleaseYear":"1993","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Gainax","Publisher":"Gainax","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":156384,"FileName":"236b81f5-5c67-4bf2-b6ae-fdfa2cf68695.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":156384,"FileName":"0a34142f-7249-41d6-a8fa-c33dc74d40ce.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189062,"Name":"Milkymate","ReleaseYear":"1991","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Atsic","Publisher":"Atsic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189062,"FileName":"2de4385d-2a58-4e55-a537-7aab2c0688e6.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189062,"FileName":"c1d28c3d-0669-4e65-9423-bdad56c679b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189062,"FileName":"456d4938-d43b-4a55-bf0d-69d5a0a00a8e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124332,"Name":"Mirai","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"The year is 720 of the Galactic Era.

Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.\n\nNinja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.\n\nThe levels (called “scenes” in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations.

Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.\n\nPlayers begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.","MaxPlayers":"8","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q6AmYh-RgE","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Koei","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124381,"FileName":"33c3138f-910b-48bd-91c4-6eb5951ef11a.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124381,"FileName":"cb6d2efe-76b7-4ad2-b5a4-550456d92930.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124381,"FileName":"d5a2671f-4fd5-4ed8-8ca1-dc840f8814a4.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124381,"FileName":"c68b7f45-429f-4ab1-b416-87b843423635.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124381,"FileName":"9cc53c4a-e458-4903-930e-644e0eeb1bfc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124381,"FileName":"d8e43443-c4fa-4ade-8a96-38afa388dad4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168207,"Name":"Not Again!","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lRdOhHCZ_U","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Puzzle","Developer":"Flying Bytes","Publisher":"Flying Bytes","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"40a3c5b5-c5e7-442e-ab0a-5f82382ee762.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"a57caa14-0a57-4f91-8464-e6b922b49ef9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"d3054f33-7756-47cb-8af8-76d487ad1d18.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"74e8b2ea-011a-451a-847a-062663b431ba.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"efdc5790-f9d0-49c4-a200-30db7ad127c3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"023eccc2-7597-424a-a35b-76c4ed141409.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"0de6fd96-8e3a-4b24-b98a-d7491f35b4a5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"6f2c7ec7-246d-4e83-a405-f3ea76b24de0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"03cc8615-74ff-4e22-9ada-985abd02251c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"1a75a896-4e2b-4a39-af77-3748ccfd529e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168207,"FileName":"af4b2e5c-aa37-489f-ad2a-23197aa2f4b6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151552,"Name":"Nueve Principes en Amber","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The single-player adventure is controlled via typed keyboard commands.

Prince Corwin must escape assassination attempts and intrigues enacted by his siblings, and yet must forge alliances with some of his siblings to become the reigning king of Amber.(Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nSPANISH Info\n\nNueve Príncipes en Amber es la conversión a MSX 2 del original de Telarium, a su vez basado en la novela de Roger Zelazny publicada en 1970.\nAunque la novela fue traducida como \"Nueve Príncipes de Ámbar\", el juego mantuvo el nombre original en esta versión creada por Idealogic.\nEl argumento (Wikipedia) es el siguiente: Carl Corey despierta con amnesia, encerrado en un hospital psiquiátrico de Nueva York. Tras escapar y reunir pieza a pieza la verdad descubre que realmente es Corwin, Príncipe de Ámbar, el verdadero mundo, del cual la Tierra es una mera sombra. Es uno de los nueve hermanos que luchan por el trono de Ámbar tras la desaparición de su padre, y enemigo mortal de uno de ellos: Eric, responsable de su amnesia y encierro.\nEsta historia nos lleva a lo que realmente Roger Zelanzy consideró no sólo la obra de su vida sino también la verdadera explicación de nuestro mundo.\nComo en otras ocasiones, la versión para MSX 2 es la más cuidada a nivel gráfico, superando a las originales estadounidenses.(Computeremuzone)","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Idealogic","Publisher":"Idealogic","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151552,"FileName":"bb238a60-5a93-4ed3-9fb0-d826cdb6f11a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":151552,"FileName":"50242f67-2eed-49e5-a618-242c24542131.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"},{"DatabaseID":151552,"FileName":"7ddea232-32eb-403f-a1b2-67b4a47c6260.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Spain"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":33856,"Name":"Nyancle","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=208&v=_ZOrG7E_RiY","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"E - Everyone","Genres":" Racing","Developer":"Bit2","Publisher":"Panasoft","ReleaseDate":"1988-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":33856,"FileName":"48edd1f8-8873-4f66-b672-1451f425aeb0.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33856,"FileName":"ad910630-50f9-4744-94ce-7dab5105ad0c.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Asia"},{"DatabaseID":33856,"FileName":"b8b19665-ca6a-4601-95de-0265d43f7783.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":33856,"AlternateName":"Nyancle Racing","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189067,"Name":"Nyanpi","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":"Compile","Publisher":"Compile","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189067,"FileName":"550b2d26-50ff-4bea-a49b-e7faf2798f21.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189067,"FileName":"2c132b09-6c21-472e-afcc-bb6753886179.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189067,"FileName":"0177eab5-363e-4701-b5ba-e1e8e197d4fc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189067,"FileName":"6aa69647-73df-4b53-ab04-ff618f1fc0c5.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189067,"FileName":"94013bf3-f041-4161-832c-056d58088686.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":189067,"AlternateName":"Meow Puzzle","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189067,"AlternateName":"Nyan Puzzle","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":124383,"Name":"Ogre","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Ogre is a 2D turn-based strategy game, and a direct computer conversion of Steve Jackson's board game of supertanks going against conventional infantry with howitzers.

She only had eyes for her beloved Pentaro, a young good-looking penguin from the neighborhood. They were a happy couple but the Emperor, in a fit of rage and jealousy, kidnapped Lucytesse, and carried her off to his palace at the South Pole.\n\nPentaro departed swiftly to rescue her and, after countless perils and adventures in the ice and crevices of the South Pole, finally succeeded in reaching the Emperor's palace and rescuing his sweetheart.\n\nThey lived happily together for a while, far from the realms of the Emperor. But he had not had his final say. His revenge would consist of keeping the merry couple apart, kidnapping Pentaro this time and secluding him in a far-off place of his kingdom, far from the South Pole, lost in the boundaries of his realms and utterly unknown to our penguin. He was hoping that Pentaro's own desperation, far from his beloved and unable to escape, would become a punishment worse than death.\n\nHis cruelty knew no bounds. But Pentaro refused to resign himself to the fate the Emperor had planned for him. After overcoming numerous hazards amid the lava caverns, underground passageways and rivers, he managed to escape; not even the raging opposition from the island inhabitants who, fearful of the wrath of the Emperor, tried to keep Pentaro at any price, could hold him.\n\nIt did not take him long to realize that the unknown place from which he had just escaped was actually located on an island, thanks to the map he had gotten during his confinement. He himself could hardly have imagined how useful it would turn out to be one day...\n\nPentaro will have to escape from the island if he wants to meet up with his beloved Lucytesse ever again.

The two other powers competed with the New Communist Federation, developing their own killer satellites, and the danger of total annihilation became once again an issue. Seeing no future for the Earth, humans started to colonize other planets. In 22th century, they sent an experimental ship \"Septemius 1\" to a star six light years far away from the Solar System. The ship's main computer, \"Racoon\", sent a strange message before stopping any communication. Keith McDonnell, a seventeen-year-old crew member of the ship \"Septemius 2\", was sent to investigate the strange disappearance.\n\nPsy-O-Blade is a Japanese adventure in anime style.

In Single mode, the player takes on the role of Arle Nadja, a 16-year-old female spellcaster that has the pleasure of foiling Satan's plans. Satan wishes to take over the world, and Arle stands in his way. Arle must first however battle her way through 12 opponents before facing Satan, and unlike Dr Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, with the exception of Rulue, they are not under Satan's control, nor were they created by him (for Rulue, she fell in love with him). Once Arle has beaten Satan, the world is saved, so she can return home. As in all main Puyo games, the story mode consists of playing Puyo matches against a fixed sequence of characters in one of three courses. In Double mode, two players play against each other. In exactly the same fashion as before, by out-chaining one another, the player tries to fill up their opponent's grid. Since the rules of sending so many garbage blocks made games short-lived, no matter how many chains are sent, Compile added the rule of Sousai in Puyo Puyo TSU and onwards. This lets players counter opponents' attacks with chains of their own, sending any garbage blocks back to them as a result of overflow. In endless mode, the player must continually match puyos to get the highest score they can.

The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.\n\nDespite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.\n\nAfter the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration.\n\nBattles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Humming Bird Soft","Publisher":"Humming Bird Soft","ReleaseDate":"1990-03-16T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186760,"FileName":"aa9f4380-9564-47bf-b61b-a370140cfaf4.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186760,"FileName":"aa5fac9d-fc92-48c8-abb3-4fd5a8f33e0b.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186760,"FileName":"32890916-9404-4685-839c-1c3341479666.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186760,"FileName":"7ce9abce-9faa-40b4-a1f6-471ea5c9479d.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186760,"FileName":"9f85df55-703a-4fd9-88f6-1cda8453b6bc.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186760,"FileName":"3339bfb2-f3a0-428d-a595-0f04de3abff6.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186760,"AlternateName":"Record of Lodoss War","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":189084,"Name":"Red Lights of Amsterdam","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"The Bytebusters","Publisher":"Eaglesoft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189084,"FileName":"83cf79cc-273e-4d00-927a-d04180c64de8.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":189084,"FileName":"11925212-be13-4536-b5be-a986457c8148.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189084,"FileName":"8103ea83-2824-45aa-b6df-8e11768ae85e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168365,"Name":"Rekenwonder","ReleaseYear":"1986","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"true","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Education","Developer":"Radarsoft","Publisher":"Philips","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"80349623-748f-4d9c-8399-eaffece63f11.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"a8664de0-02c2-4b8f-a91f-e0f60d9fd73f.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"a9fb5ace-d3f7-4e8a-a6a6-11460505741a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"348c6cce-03db-4a14-bb2d-476301cc1b05.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"3f1c634b-6fe7-454c-826e-df0ef1675dae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"0fb16196-c9a4-4c0e-8557-2775b8b96b7f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168365,"FileName":"239cf1f9-c78d-475d-a5ef-08cda12009f4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":132764,"Name":"Relics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Relics is an action-adventure game where players take the role of a spirit who can possess different characters.

The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Koei","Publisher":"Koei","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"54dd7e2d-5b3a-479e-b5b4-004475533752.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"957a1c59-5eac-45e6-945c-24230ad3094c.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"884b5897-61f6-460e-899d-461c9ef62cc0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"44691b42-1dd2-4295-93d8-6429aef2224f.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"211acf39-39ce-405a-aafc-1102fc30b85e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"2d6adec4-bf16-4b77-a43d-e92360933cde.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"dcd5d8bf-9f5b-43c8-9967-e58904f50f19.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124520,"FileName":"011be9e2-44da-43aa-8286-21eea94c502c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":151739,"Name":"Sa-Zi-Ri","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action","Developer":"Renovation","Publisher":"Telenet Japan Co., Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":151739,"FileName":"17e7d96a-1db8-41a8-9f34-b4a09ee02c37.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151739,"FileName":"cd35247e-cbc1-48b8-8a8a-24d2447b3532.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":151739,"FileName":"5dd50d9d-d282-4d1b-8cb5-52f5128930a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189089,"Name":"Schwarzschild II: Teikoku no Haishin","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Teikoku no Haishin is a sequel to Kyōran no Ginga: Schwarzschild.

Natural disasters and the military strategies of the Honsha Empire have turned the Jiro star cluster region into a realm of chaos and unrest. A new kingdom was established in the Somari star system, and was denied a peaceful existence following the combined military actions of the countries Lossaria and Tristia. The player must defend the kingdom and win the upcoming war.\n\nLike its predecessor, Teikoku no Haishin is a turn-based strategy game with a heavy emphasis on actual strategy rather than tactics. Gameplay, interface, and visual style are nearly identical to those of the previous game. The player must manage finances and use resources to build a sufficiently powerful starship fleet. Diplomatic options are available as well. Once a battle phase begins, ship movement and attacks unfold automatically. The player can change general commands during his turn, but is unable to physically navigate ships, which distinguishes the game from tactics-oriented strategy games.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","Publisher":"Kogado Studio, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1990-06-28T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":189089,"FileName":"055db869-b2ba-46b6-a1ea-c84e93c8b136.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189089,"FileName":"2500b7af-707b-4db9-8077-0437af2b018b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189089,"FileName":"3648b5b0-f6fd-4bc6-aa98-c69ea443432c.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189089,"FileName":"5d4f4e75-ddca-4c6c-9d3b-81c969592b78.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189089,"FileName":"ab72b593-684f-44dd-9dc5-dd61e7c353be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189088,"Name":"Schwarzschild: Kyouran no Ginga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"By the year 3260, humans have mastered interstellar travel and successfully colonized almost the entire Milky Way.

As the player acquires and deploys spaceships, they move and fight according to pre-defined commands. There are no separate battles where the player inputs active orders; instead, the player can opt to change the movement trajectory or tactics of a ship, watching the events unfold when the turn is over.

Except as Lila (now promoted to Lieutenant) points out in the intro, why send in the Supernatural SWAT squad to deal with common terrorists? As the Chief reveals, they've found strange creatures in sewers - creatures not of this world, but from Hades (the other dimension in the first game), meaning whoever was behind the previous crisis is behind this one. What survivors remain are barricading themselves indoors. The city has been cordoned off and Lila is the prime candidate for the mission. So off she sets, with four fellow S-SWAT members, to regain control.\n\nThis sequel has undergone radical changes from the original, with all of the RPG trappings stripped out. There's no longer any kind of stats, menu system to navigate, day/night cycle, overworld map, or weapon recovery items. In fact the only items are drugs, which restore health to maximum and only one can be carried at a time, and key items with further the story. The biggest (and arguably best) change is the combat: there are no longer any random battles. Taking place on a series of massively sprawling maps, as opposed to shrunken JRPG-style maps which warp you to new maps when entering buildings, all enemies can be seen immediately. Furthermore you never fight more than a single enemy at a time.

Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...\n\nShiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down \"world map\": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. \n\nThe goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtaKjYvuueQ","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Adventure","Developer":"Fun Project","Publisher":"Victor Musical Industries","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"ceaa0020-4972-46a9-a278-4e3f76748857.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"59eb1e89-6d8b-4258-9ed8-5533d769b993.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"856fa702-5d0a-4b4c-9fdb-ad24beeafa97.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"638edb0f-d1ca-4543-b91e-1c4468bce3d0.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"aa7bc5f4-5321-4985-9eba-0dc7a912e346.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"9c27985d-ba03-431f-92b3-f3f6708c898f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"cfa6138a-12a0-4829-b885-827266f7e5a0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"e15dae18-6bbf-4c32-ac0b-7424b718d626.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33862,"FileName":"c5746a72-bb8c-4ac6-a06c-720d42d5305a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":202148,"Name":"Shonan Densetsu: Akai Hoshi no Densetsu ","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":"A turn-based strategy game with fights between gangs of typical Japanese badass bikers that was created as a parody of Shonan Bakusozoku, a manga with this type of setting that has an anime adaptation, and in which the objective is to capture the base of the rival gang.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Cross Media Soft","Publisher":"Cross Media Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":202148,"FileName":"622ef3c4-3945-433b-a26b-9301c03b3fd2.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":202148,"FileName":"dc6e7442-6b6e-4fec-83ac-75c084291225.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202148,"FileName":"b0831cd8-136e-4e50-9acf-313e410414be.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202148,"FileName":"9140cea2-08c9-451f-9a62-ec9bc64c12b0.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202148,"FileName":"77a782f7-ccac-4572-a2f2-44833594e248.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":202148,"FileName":"0f019e28-e106-4127-b25b-e063a723ca22.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":202148,"AlternateName":"The Legend of Shonan: The Legend of Red Star","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":168379,"Name":"Shrines of Enigma","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HfN-JzyWipY","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Element","Publisher":"Sunrise","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168379,"FileName":"da49a78b-4299-40ff-83cc-2940accb87d9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168379,"FileName":"152f4ac7-034b-47d5-a542-52241a2109ac.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168379,"FileName":"d66a11bf-1c95-4898-a9a0-f4b84caeda76.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168379,"FileName":"0ec02d8d-6cd2-4b00-940f-49bebb51fe66.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34083,"Name":"Silviana","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"A fun little disk-based action-RPG for the MSX2 similar to the Ys series.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Pack-In-Video","Publisher":"Pack-In-Video","ReleaseDate":"1989-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34083,"FileName":"e16ff740-50a2-4d1c-9729-79755af768bd.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34083,"FileName":"86a55907-428d-42fe-8a48-af0c7994ba55.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34083,"FileName":"0824a5d3-dbc1-428b-9634-39b74bb65717.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34083,"FileName":"ff7e08f5-19a8-4221-b38c-371247e4168d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34083,"FileName":"0e376be7-2e27-4a89-a079-15252d0bfb70.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":34059,"Name":"Snatcher","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Snatcher is set in the futuristic Neo Kobe City, a city of madness and decadence. The year is 2047 (or 2042, according to the original Japanese version). Mankind is facing its gravest crisis. A mysterious bio-roid life form has appeared. Its true nature and purpose are unknown. Is it some country's secret weapon, or an alien from another world? They appear in the winter, killing people and taking their place in society. They wear artificial skin and can sweat and even bleed. They are called \"Snatchers\" because they \"snatch\" their victims before they take their place.\n\nA new police force, specifically trained to fight the Snatchers, has been formed. They are JUNKERs (which is deciphered as \"Japanese Undercover Neuro-Kinetic Elimination Rangers\" in the English version). Every time you encounter someone, a difficult question must be asked — is it a person or a snatcher?\n\nThe player takes control of Gillian Seed, one of the JUNKERs. The gameplay largely follows the structure of a Japanese-style adventure. The player uses a menu-driven interface to execute commands, which include moving between locations and interacting with the environment. Typically, every room contains objects that can be examined, leading to text descriptions and comments. Conversations occupy a large portion of the gameplay, with various topics available and a wealth of information about the game's world and characters. A few parts contain light puzzle-solving elements, though as a rule the game is almost completely devoid of puzzles.\n\nDuring key moments of the narrative, the player will be prompted to participate in intense shooting sequences. The goal is usually to kill all the enemies that pop out on the screen before they are able to kill Gillian. Some of such sequences are timed, i.e. the player is required to quickly shoot before another events is triggered, leading to the protagonist's death.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":null,"Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Konami","Publisher":"Konami","ReleaseDate":"1988-12-23T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"9bd2d563-9e7f-4d33-b25f-3e8e4ef8531a.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"0d83575d-247d-49d6-8a91-1b2730a95b31.png","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"e2c7bbcc-c35c-4a08-8131-b32b382d5daa.png","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"96f75b3a-993c-446d-a1b7-f79a6f4f9dbb.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"8b371ce2-10f8-4444-bc60-c9fb141c3591.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"48411fc3-9bbe-4655-bae1-403739595738.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"50c32ccf-6eb9-490b-a94d-465ebc4ab2c9.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Background","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"3ace833b-ee46-4a6e-bcd6-843b2be00c71.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"8cddcb33-aa40-46e1-a715-43cccbae8bc7.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"8bca3553-7684-4c57-9bd0-3ed6fc702f4a.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":34059,"FileName":"aea944b3-2847-4ab3-b72f-1d09f60fa95d.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":168574,"Name":"Solid Snail","ReleaseYear":"1994","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Vivid","Publisher":"Vivid","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168574,"FileName":"f6c76a91-1a46-4223-bab3-e674171bd3a5.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"The Netherlands"},{"DatabaseID":168574,"FileName":"a43111b9-635c-4a1f-bdac-47cf30e59ae8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Select","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168574,"FileName":"b980b6b3-326f-499c-9cdf-a108b39a52d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168574,"FileName":"d61770d2-6e7d-490c-aefc-bc8ecdec22d3.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":168574,"FileName":"e363c0e3-9e8f-4986-a6ae-056681934d4b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189093,"Name":"Solitaire Royale","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"This was an early commercial instance of Card Solitaire.

The player can create up to ten characters, from whom up to four members can be present in a party at the same time. Each character is highly customizable, with four different classes/races (fighter, wizard, elf, and dwarf) and over 60 possible jobs/occupations (ranging from clown to exorcist) available for them to perform; each has its own strengths and weaknesses, affecting the seven primary attributes (strength, intelligence, protection, magic resistance, vitality, dexterity, and karma) in different ways, as well as different equipment limitations.\n\nThe player can choose from fifteen different scenarios, or quests, to play through in the order of their choice. The party must battle enemies and perform tasks within the given levels to clear each scenario, before moving onto another scenario of their choice. The player controls the entire party at the same time, with all four members running in a line, jumping in sequence, and attacking in unison. The party members follow behind in a manner similar to the Options in the arcade shooter Gradius (1985). Sorcerian also employs class-based puzzles, such as using a high-strength character to force open doors.\n\nAll the characters have a default starting age of 16. Each time a player begins a new scenario, a year passes by, while additional time passes by in towns as a character goes through training or enchants items. The characters age at different rates depending on their race, with humans reaching old age at 60, dwarves at 100, and elves at 200. Upon reaching old age, for every year that passes, a character can die permanently at a random time. There is also an “Advance Time” to speed up the flow of time. Another new feature of Sorcerian was its episodic format that extended across various expansion packs. Besides the default fifteen scenarios that come with the game, there were a number of additional scenario packs released. The aging system was created with the additional scenario packs in mind.

Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.\n\n[Personal Reasons For Remembering]\nReally loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuhzEiTkz7Q","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Marionette","Publisher":"Pony Canyon","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":33917,"FileName":"de62a6b6-24b1-42c0-b90e-afad2d108c10.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":33917,"FileName":"7c783dcc-8976-4637-9f9d-7d4b5781ea7a.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33917,"FileName":"0bbb76cd-4f54-4b92-8391-764cf747fab9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33917,"FileName":"259b168b-207e-43d9-9c7d-235c44e107c8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":33917,"FileName":"c9ea0fc6-cba2-4c4b-b750-433c6dd0671c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":150176,"Name":"Starship Rendezvous","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Scaptrust","Publisher":"Scaptrust","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":150176,"FileName":"a9e40d80-b035-4b89-9a34-12078a3f3e5c.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150176,"FileName":"8c735d7a-2c31-4204-adfc-62e2fd387895.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":150176,"FileName":"fb57d86a-5ca6-449d-94d6-4dea5058e5cf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124558,"Name":"Strategic Mars","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Strategic Mars is a shooter from dB-Soft.

Footage and pictures found their way to the web and sparked the interest of many fans who tried convincing norakomi to resume the project. Some time later the decision was made that the game would be finished by another team.\n\nNow, with less than 6 months until the deadline, Baka-Yo! Softcorp has decided to make it official, announcing \"Pointless Fighting\" as the very first entry of #msxdev Compo 2014! They certainly have their work cut out for them. The game will no doubt be highly anticipated and looks set to raise the bar on MSX2 development.\n\nThe current requirements for running this game are a MSX2 with 128kB RAM and a 4MB FlashROM, but in order to make the game accessible to more MSX users, these may be changed to 256kB RAM and MSX-DOS2. It will support keyboard and joysticks, including Joymega-adapter with Sega 6-button devices.

There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.\n\nThe game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. \n\nDifferent units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.","MaxPlayers":"4","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nQvb81uXuc","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"SystemSoft","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"13d526da-a401-4ec2-b482-8ac5fe47ea14.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"4d4803d1-c11c-4d2d-aaec-fec7547297ba.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"d88792d6-6fa7-4203-87e4-b814d3d8eb62.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"b1ee3417-f93c-4c39-960b-68018e8f9243.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"199ba827-9624-4ee6-bab2-34412b069383.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"654b0fff-b1be-4b5f-8ff8-16d32dd84264.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"81150f53-4c08-40fe-a01b-6e77a21c44c7.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"d012a263-f465-47e7-82ef-3afc368bf9b4.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124560,"FileName":"d3098579-132b-461e-897c-f4ae95209ed2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124561,"Name":"Super Lode Runner","ReleaseYear":"1987","Overview":"Between 1984 to 1986, Irem released four more different Lode Runner arcade games in Japan, following the original arcade games release.

After a few screens though the enemies suddenly get a lot tougher and can kill you almost immediately.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfeUnFW7tSw","Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Sein Soft","Publisher":"Sein Soft","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"d9be7522-894b-4cae-a643-a86b0e77d0df.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"c4b86ff5-1574-4ec9-ad42-92d6449a2eaf.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"e581dda8-0321-46c0-9168-fe6b10075c73.jpg","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"47159dd8-c164-43f6-92c7-e4bbfe4d080a.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"ff95be2e-fd38-4838-995f-b96e1cbb3bf5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"7b1aaacf-e58c-417e-878a-f59b815b8ebf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"7a1416eb-64b5-4dc0-abe3-35cd9eb08efd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"575dba4a-472b-435b-9a00-046946733d73.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"b7ccd069-e016-48f5-8b72-190878f6777d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":124565,"FileName":"eb261591-a2df-41d7-b4c6-5b92e5e16d42.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189095,"Name":"Sword of Legend Lenam","ReleaseYear":"1990","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Hertz","Publisher":"Hertz","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":189095,"FileName":"e7708b02-53cd-49e2-85fb-b55be12788de.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":189095,"FileName":"151a79c7-bf0e-4614-baf5-de42be5da725.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":189095,"FileName":"06902b94-8c54-424f-9ab7-5c5efe2d1ca8.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":189096,"Name":"T.D.F.

Blon-Win is arrested by WWWF and must find a way to contact her friends, escape, and defeat the treacherous organization.\n\nThe sequel follows the same gameplay format, being a predominantly puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure with an interface that combines menu-based verb selection and interaction with objects and characters highlighted on-screen. Compared to the previous games, the gameplay is more streamlined and the menu contains less commands. Rarely used options such as answering \"Yes\" or \"No\" during dialogues or the command \"Rescue\" have been eliminated.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186753,"FileName":"3ed4c05d-7db9-45de-9b44-e1d540f4f9ec.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186753,"FileName":"70ec5418-7214-4f6c-9f3a-fc5d1adb8baa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186753,"FileName":"2a3ea1ce-85eb-4367-a0bc-3edfd1c4e2d7.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":186757,"Name":"The 4th Unit Act.3: Dual Targets","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Three months have passed since the destruction of the oceanic base of the criminal organization WWWF.

The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses (\"happy\", \"angry\", etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between \"Rescue\", \"Think\", and \"Fight\" commands during the storyline. These choices may influence the plot and lead the game to different endings, most of which are considered \"false\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":186757,"FileName":"ee922034-2297-4833-af07-2de049e982a6.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186757,"FileName":"b2a94520-60f4-42c4-89c2-cd005590473a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186757,"FileName":"05e05829-3295-4f48-86ad-68db62475e7a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186757,"FileName":"df70b49d-6b00-49dc-a37e-e15f72d82bf9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186757,"AlternateName":"Dual Targets: The 4th Unit Act.3","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":186758,"Name":"The 4th Unit Act.4: Zerø","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Zerø is the fourth entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to Dual Targets.

However, it still retains the emotional response system (only three out of five are present: \"nice\", \"angry\", and \"sad\"), which is sometimes needed to steer conversation. Topics are fixed for all dialogues. Much of the game involves looking for people located in various areas of the Unified Force base, trying to figure out who the spy is. The simple turn-based combat is present in this installment as well. The player can choose to attack any person Blon-Win encounters; however, attacking an ally would result in a Game Over regardless of the battle's outcome.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Data West","Publisher":"Data West","ReleaseDate":"1990-04-20T00:00:00-07:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":186758,"FileName":"ed4135a3-bb5d-4ce6-95d9-3026d5dacbf9.jpg","Type":"Banner","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186758,"FileName":"76b99fff-6cd0-4a4f-88eb-71f89d194e93.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186758,"FileName":"9c1d57c5-d077-43a0-9477-a818c7df4339.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186758,"FileName":"30db2cf5-037c-4271-a655-123a1c5cffe9.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":186758,"FileName":"71f13459-6086-4155-ac65-61b7bbbb6488.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186758,"FileName":"7e115bb1-43d9-4c82-a9f1-18e0a0503564.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":186758,"AlternateName":"Zerø: The 4th Unit Act.4","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":186758,"AlternateName":"The 4th Unit Act.4: Zero","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":34125,"Name":"The Cockpit","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"The Cockpit is a Japanese commercial plane simulator for runway landings only.

The player must make careful judgements and use their limited time wisely to find and hook the largest marlin they can before the competition ends.\n\nIn order to catch anything, the player must choose one of several regions of sea in which to fish. Areas which look promising have large fish icons. Time passes more quickly on this screen, so it's in the player's best interest to find a spot quickly.\n\nOnce a sea region has been selected, the player must choose the right kind of bait for hooking billfish and simply sit until they have a bite. At this point, the player must use the gauge above the screen to maneuver themselves and reel the fish on the line. Each fish is judged on its size and play resumes.\n\nThe first game based on the Tsurikichi Sanpei license, Blue Marlin Hen was released on the NES and the MSX around the same time in 1988.

Lord British wished to base people's well-being on the ethical principles of Truth, Love, and Courage, proclaiming the Eight Virtues (Honesty, Compassion, Valor, Justice, Sacrifice, Honor, Spirituality, and Humility) as the ideal everyone should strive for. The person who could accomplish full understanding and realization of these virtues would serve as a spiritual leader and a moral example for the inhabitants of Britannia; he alone would be able to obtain holy artifacts, descend into the Stygian Abyss, and access the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.

It is a direct sequel to Xak: The Art of Visual Stage (Xak I). The game was released in Japan only, but due to an MSX scene that arose in Europe (predominately in the Netherlands region) some of the MSX versions of Xak received fan translations. An enhanced remake was later released for the NEC PC-Engine, together with the first game in the series Xak as Xak I & II by Telenet Japan's development team Riot.\n\nXak II, being a direct sequel to the first game in the series, it features the same high fantasy setting as Xak. The gods' division of the world into Xak, the world of men, Oceanity, the world faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons, as referenced in Xak, is depicted in this game's introduction. In this adventure, the main hero of the Xak series, Latok Kart is exploring a vast region situated around a single central village of Banuwa.\n\nIn Xak, the protagonist Latok Kart fought and defeated the demon Zemu Badu. One of Badu's minions escaped, a black-robed man known only as Necromancer.

A rumour about the whereabouts of Latok's father Dork has surfaced around the village of Banuwa. Latok and his faerie companion Pixie travel to the village to investigate, but soon run into Gospel's minions.

Latok hears rumors about a man who looks exactly like him and was last seen near an old tower infested by monsters, which nobody dares enter. Latok and his girlfriend Fray arrive at the tower entrance and meet their friends there. Latok decides to venture into the tower with just one companion, unaware of the fact that the \"false Latok\" was just a trap set by powerful demons, intended to lure him into the den of evil.\n\nXak Precious Package: The Tower of Gazzel is a side-story in the Xak universe. It differs from the main Xak series in several gameplay-related aspects, even though graphically it is very similar to the previous Xak games. Most importantly, Tower of Gazzel is not an RPG: Latok begins the game with maximized parameters and can not become stronger. The combat is similar to other Xak games: Latok attacks enemies with a sword in real time, and receives damage when they touch him. Tower of Gazzel is much more oriented towards puzzle-solving than the previous games. The entire game takes place in the tower, which is a huge maze containing various obstacles that the player must find solutions for (locked doors, seemingly impassable areas, etc.). Latok can jump over some dangerous spots (such as poisonous puddles). An important gameplay element is Latok's companion. Each of the four available companions has a different ability: for example, Fray can cast spells, Pixie can handle certain mechanisms in the tower, etc. In order to solve many of the puzzles, it is necessary to bring the right companion to the spot and let her take care of the problem.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Role-Playing","Developer":"Micro Cabin","Publisher":"Micro Cabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":152280,"FileName":"7f8ce6ad-f894-40dc-884a-c861a99a94d5.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":152280,"FileName":"6ba93182-215a-4381-8261-2fdca4ab5287.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":152280,"FileName":"caa0f12a-b16f-48bb-b8ab-c96d2804e520.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":152280,"AlternateName":"Xak III: The Tower of Gazzel","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":152001,"Name":"Xak: The Art of Visual Stage","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Xak: The Art of Visual Stage (サーク) is the first game in the fantasy role-playing video game series Xak developed and published by Micro Cabin.  An English translation of Xak: The Art of Visual Stage was also released in 2007 on the now-defunct retro gaming service WOOMB.net, and is now to become available on Project EGG.\n\nXak: The Art of Visual Stage features a typical high fantasy setting. According to the game world's legends, a great war was fought between the benevolent but weakening ancient gods and a demon race, which led to the collapse and eventual mortality of the gods. After this 'War of Sealing', the gods divided the world into three parts: Xak, the world of humans, Oceanity, the world of faeries, and Xexis, the world of demons. The demon world of Xexis was tightly sealed from the other two worlds as to prevent reentry of the warmongering demon race. Some demons were left behind in Xak, however, and others managed to discover a separate means to enter Xak from Xexis anyway. This ancient history is displayed in the introduction of Xak II.\n\nOne of them, Badu, was a very powerful demon, able to use coercive magic to make humans do his bidding. Duel, the god of war, managed to defeat Badu and seal him away in a mountain of ice for 250 years. The god later settled in a village known as Fearless to live out the rest of his mortal life.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Badu's prison is broken. Demons overrun parts of Xak once again. In order to stop the ravaging of his lands, the King of Wavis sends a messenger faerie to Dork Kart, a famous warrior living in the village of Fearless. Dork, however, has gone missing. The player takes on the role of Latok Kart, Dork's 16-year-old son, as he meets the messenger faerie, Pixie. Latok embarks on the King's quest to slay Badu, hoping to find his father along the way.\n\nIn his travels, Latok is guided by Duel's spirit. Over the course of the game, it turns out that Dork and thus Latok is a descendant of Duel.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Microsoft MSX2","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Role-Playing","Developer":"Microcabin","Publisher":"Microcabin","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":152001,"FileName":"b22de2bb-e7aa-4cd9-8db2-2d6c15205824.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":152001,"FileName":"aa0a68a3-415f-4f2a-89e8-91ae6ac7bb28.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"},{"DatabaseID":152001,"FileName":"a916b549-27a6-4978-84c5-54a78b04760e.jpg","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"Japan"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":124879,"Name":"Xevious: Fardraut Saga","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"Xevious: Fardraut Saga is a vertically-scrolling shooter that contains two modes: Recon and Scramble.
