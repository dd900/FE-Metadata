YOU WILL BE BESET FROM TIME TO TIME BY NATURAL EVENTS.\n\nResults of your actions are narrated to you in plain text; player input primarily consists of punching in numbers and selecting the occasional YES and NO (the end of every turn typically asking you DO YOU WISH TO ABDICATE?) into your keyboard, touchscreen -- or TeleType terminal. Gameplay and interaction are restrictive, but the minimalist number-crunching is foundational for all the managerial leadership games that followed: You can buy and sell acres of land, purchasing extra bushels of grain to sow in your fields or feed your populace if so needed. Between turns (only 10 on the iPhone version), citizens starve and are laid low by plagues, peasants immigrate to replace them, and vermin deplete your stores of grain reserves. One year is much the same as the next, though the particular numerical values shift according to elegant algorithms the deeper understanding of which will lead you to a fruitful and harmonious reign, concluding with enthusiastic congratulations from the computer:\n\n    A FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE!!!

At the end of the game a summary of all carrier damage, aircraft losses, and victory points from other targets and the Midway invasion are output followed by an evaluation of results.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore PET","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Strategy","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164831,"FileName":"42dace81-36b5-412a-a75e-ef8e6a3c6367.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164831,"FileName":"35d6b66e-34ea-4740-9654-27db939d071b.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164831,"FileName":"a29c6bd9-0b57-41f7-b211-fd5e00ad6eff.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164831,"FileName":"7823fe88-2b02-4932-85c8-4d0d390d8b49.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164831,"FileName":"a168e922-c8bf-43cd-b0fb-8625c5ea1654.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":164831,"FileName":"1a9727e5-ac95-471d-a687-bec9d2a79341.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":192474,"Name":"Miner!","ReleaseYear":"1980","Overview":"MINER! In this game you are a gold miner, facing the normal hazards of a deep mine: there are cave-ins, (which sometimes cause you to lose all your gold!), as well as underground springs that will flood your carefully dug tunnels. You move by using the numeric pad [2] is down, [4] is left, [6] right, [8] is up and [5] means \"stop\". Naturally, the first thing to do is get in the elevator and move down. When you get to the level where you want to work, press [4] and start digging with your pick. Gold (or hazards, such as springs or hard rock) will occur at the dots. When you find gold, get in the elevator and deposit it in the bank! You have a drill [D], explosives [E], and a pump [P] at your disposal. However, using these tools costs money!

Players look down on a battlefield of two-dimensional obstacles and maneuver their tanks to shoot and destroy each other. Each tank has nine points of armor, allowing eight hits before the final shot destroys the tank and hands victory to the opposing player.\n\nThe tanks start each game in heavy bunkers, so the first challenge is to move out safely away from the enemy line-of-fire. Plentiful obstacles and the tanks' moderate speed means play is as much a tactical challenge as one for the reflexes. Speed on the trigger can be very important, though, because when hit a tank is relocated randomly and any shell in mid-flight disappears. In a face-off this means whichever shell lands first wins. The trigger finger must be tempered, however, as each tank can only have one shot on the screen at a time. Over-anticipating your opponent can lead to reloading at the most inopportune moment.\n\nDifferent platforms provide very different play, from keyboard to joystick, color to black-and-white, as well as battlefield variations. On TRS-80's, the battlefield is fixed from game to game and obstacles cannot be destroyed. In all cases, a solitaire version is provided, putting the computer in control of one of the tanks. Its reflexes are very quick.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Commodore PET","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":164825,"FileName":"eea6f030-9b8b-45dd-8b2e-6546be502ffc.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164825,"FileName":"fd6a3934-d929-4358-8773-b5e4fc9bee28.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":164825,"FileName":"d1740f0d-ab2f-4088-8d18-963c35e25be6.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":164826,"Name":"Tanktics","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"It is September 6, 1943 following the debacle at Kursk the German Army reels back to the protection of the Dneiper River.
