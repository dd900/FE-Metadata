A radar map near the top of the screen shows the position of enemies and the main ship. The player's ship can climb up and down, and turn. When an alien vessel approaches, the sights (cross-hair) changes, indicating when there is a good chance of a hit. When it changes a second time, it locks onto the enemy. Only a laser weapon can be fired and it takes some time to recharge.\n\nThe screen shows the player's score, the high score, the status of the mothership, the remaining strength of the shields, the amount of fuel left, and various indicators for climb/turn ratio and the lasers.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_4xCXxtrKM","Platform":"Acorn Atom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"A&F Software","Publisher":"A&F Software","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":126680,"FileName":"06d88a5e-0489-4c33-9529-22653ad3a615.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126680,"FileName":"a18f2673-21f8-4d48-a792-a82fd1156a9f.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United Kingdom"},{"DatabaseID":126680,"FileName":"a55b64e3-7909-4f0d-b1c7-2faadfbcd08f.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203753,"Name":"Dammen","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Dammen is a Dutch checkers game.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Homebrew","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Atom","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Board Game","Developer":null,"Publisher":"Public Domain/Freeware","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":203753,"FileName":"ee128fc6-6e61-4148-9421-4d66b9453d9a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":203758,"Name":"Demon Dungeon","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The objective of Demon Dungeon is to escape from a dungeon full of monsters.

To advance a level the player has to find a secret passage. \nEach cell on the map has a number that represents the likelihood of it containing something.

Spells and magic stones have a 90% chance of killing the monster but only one spell can be used on each type of monster. Running away should only be used when the spell has been used and there are no magic stones left, since there is a 25% chance that the monster will follow and kill the player.

Painter's gameplay is very similar to Amidar's bonus stages where the traditional boxes in the screen have points associated with. It can also be compared to Potty Painter in the Jungle which was one of the first Amidar variations for ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.\n\nPainter's main goal is to fill all the boxes in each frame in a certain period of time by completing the pathways (lines) around them. This must be done before the \"Bonus\" value reaches zero. To complicate things the \"Painter\" has to avoid any collision with the \"Chasers\", some entities present in the game that will try to intercept him and destroy his work. The \"Painter\" will be forced to restart the phase all over again and one of his lives will be lost in the process.\n\nTo defend himself during his gameplay and specially from the incredible speed the \"Chasers\" might get at the last skill factors of the game, the player has in his power a special tool: a gap creator. This weapon will create a temporary gap in the pathway lines preventing the \"Chasers\" from colliding with him. It can only be used three times at a time before any temporary gap is removed.\n\nThe limit of Painter's skill factor is 6. \"Chasers\" intelligence and speed will increase proportionally to the skill factor and dramatically at this point of the gaming. Prepare yourself to be ambushed.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Acorn Atom","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Puzzle","Developer":null,"Publisher":"A&F Software Ltd.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":129442,"FileName":"83cf8fe4-a429-4521-8be3-40701abc8103.jpg","Type":"Box -
