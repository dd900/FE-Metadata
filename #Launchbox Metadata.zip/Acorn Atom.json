The player is the only interceptor pilot on an Earth supply mothership. He has to survive the different attack waves of the enemies while defending the ship. At the start of each wave he is launched in a fighter ship and needs to destroy all enemies to survive the wave, while flying around freely.\n\nThere is only a limited amount of fuel available, but the player can return to the mothership at any time for a refuel, leaving the main base exposed for a moment. A radar map near the top of the screen shows the position of enemies and the main ship. The player's ship can climb up and down, and turn. When an alien vessel approaches, the sights (cross-hair) changes, indicating when there is a good chance of a hit. When it changes a second time, it locks onto the enemy. Only a laser weapon can be fired and it takes some time to recharge.\n\nThe screen shows the player's score, the high score, the status of the mothership, the remaining strength of the shields, the amount of fuel left, and various indicators for climb\/turn ratio and the lasers.","Publisher":"A&F Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"129437":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"008a2f02-bf2a-4836-b8de-90bb9eb96602.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Adventure I","ReleaseType":"Released"},"129439":{"Cooperative":"false","Name":"Early Warning","ReleaseYear":1981},"129440":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"dfc30ad7-2fb1-4279-8720-3f3b1d09484a.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Minefield","ReleaseDate":"1984-01-01T00:00:00-08:00"},"129441":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acornsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"3030467a-8056-406e-b4ad-93e320183467.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a5932aa7-c459-44b4-9233-1a1f08b34512.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Missiles","Overview":"You must defend your cities from the falling missiles and the aircraft.

Painter's gameplay is very similar to Amidar's bonus stages where the traditional boxes in the screen have points associated with. It can also be compared to Potty Painter in the Jungle which was one of the first Amidar variations for ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64.\n\nPainter's main goal is to fill all the boxes in each frame in a certain period of time by completing the pathways (lines) around them. This must be done before the \"Bonus\" value reaches zero. To complicate things the \"Painter\" has to avoid any collision with the \"Chasers\", some entities present in the game that will try to intercept him and destroy his work. The \"Painter\" will be forced to restart the phase all over again and one of his lives will be lost in the process.\n\nTo defend himself during his gameplay and specially from the incredible speed the \"Chasers\" might get at the last skill factors of the game, the player has in his power a special tool: a gap creator. This weapon will create a temporary gap in the pathway lines preventing the \"Chasers\" from colliding with him. It can only be used three times at a time before any temporary gap is removed.\n\nThe limit of Painter's skill factor is 6. \"Chasers\" intelligence and speed will increase proportionally to the skill factor and dramatically at this point of the gaming. Prepare yourself to be ambushed.","Publisher":"A&F Software Ltd.","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1982},"129443":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"f040905f-f036-46ee-8d43-2883f03776d7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"}],"Name":"Robot Nim"},"129444":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"18e5eb12-298b-4c03-bc1e-72fef8d6a8b2.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"}],"Name":"Space Panic"},"129445":{"Cooperative":"false","Images":[{"FileName":"08ffe154-2820-4e74-91ee-2b5a65dc7abc.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"}],"Name":"Torpedo Run"},"129448":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Acornsoft","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Adventure","Images":[{"FileName":"d06c4e13-8ee5-49b1-858b-45d3ea2102b7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2a3897e6-1f6a-4384-bcda-76435b6b89c2.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"bc15fbb9-5e55-49e9-907c-7d61270a6316.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Adventures","Overview":"Adventures comprises the Adventure program plus three adventure games:\nDUNGEON\nSearch for treasure in a maze of interconnected caverns, tunnels and caves, inhabited by friendly and unfriendly monsters.

Directives on how to interact were provided by 'scripts', written originally in MAD-Slip, which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing Test.","Publisher":"Pro Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"129706":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Pro Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"5e2bbbab-f0df-435a-b291-4ab9ed0e99cc.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8e7fb02b-fbbb-481a-9589-9bd3b096d38d.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"Name":"Fizzle Bricks","Publisher":"Pro Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"129707":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Quodlibet","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"7451bdc3-3a8d-4b93-84b5-d76a1f197a18.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"a6d4ef01-5eee-4963-8947-9297a08e9aa7.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"Name":"Meanies","Publisher":"Quodlibet","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"129708":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"086f4433-9aae-4a0a-a765-b177eabf94ca.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"97d811a1-38f8-4baa-a35a-de8556e3b80b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"Name":"Breakout","Publisher":"Bug-Byte Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981,"VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MwX2DEoAi7Y"},"129710":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Casino","Images":[{"FileName":"f003c285-d837-42e4-bf62-1b4929b103a9.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"acf4b144-5eaa-41c7-a2d9-c36d50836c6c.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Fruit Machine","Overview":"Fruit Machine is a three wheel simulation of slot machine for one player.","Publisher":"Bug-Byte Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981},"129711":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"0a7b403a-53e2-4bbc-968d-4d2247d14129.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"0622577d-d875-4309-9d18-f62215714df0.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"},{"FileName":"ff8f3f55-91d2-4fc0-9c28-3d4f6a8f5eae.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"Name":"Galaxian","Publisher":"Bug Byte","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981},"129712":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"c5f6f462-2556-40e4-8d9d-ae884d1fff9b.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"b4909f2c-4e63-4d81-99ed-1e0246324344.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"Name":"2K Programs","Overview":"Includes:\n1) Moon-landing\n2) Reaction Test\n3) Hangman\n4) Torpedo","Publisher":"Bug-Byte Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981},"129713":{"Cooperative":"false","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"89987c4d-b25f-4704-9001-dbd578c84672.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"117a6c90-2c3c-44bb-9ed8-f4faa0ceb379.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"}],"Name":"Labyrinth","Publisher":"Bug Byte","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981},"129714":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"19f60f79-9b7d-4183-8e92-0aa34a180055.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"8ec52002-b82d-4651-a251-8d1b0bbee84c.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ad169526-6698-4fdb-a73e-abfbf852f5be.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Pinball","Publisher":"Bug-Byte Software","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1981},"129715":{"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Ramtronics","ESRB":"Not Rated","Images":[{"FileName":"48a4b319-ea81-42c5-83ba-6ebdb8dbab1f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Cart - Front"}],"Name":"Africa Diamond","Publisher":"Ramtronics","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1984},"129746":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Atom Invaders","Region":"United Kingdom"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Bug-Byte Software","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Shooter","Images":[{"FileName":"55f8819a-e2dc-45c4-87ec-4576f2e84748.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"e5dee3b8-ded5-4ae9-b3d6-3103ad7ff037.png","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"65daf1bd-12eb-4f1e-a08a-fb1149adfa6f.jpg","Region":"United Kingdom","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Invaders","Overview":"Invaders is a clone of one of the most famous arcade games of all time, Space Invaders.
