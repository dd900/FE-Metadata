The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points with the low green bricks being worth 1 point each, the middle blue bricks being worth 4 points each, and the red bricks on top rewarding 7 points each. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, it's up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. The player loses a life if he happens to miss hitting the ball with his paddle and it falls into the abyss. The game ends when 7 balls are lost. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side that the ball can bounce off of are labeled side rails, and the paddle is referred to as a flipper.\n\nThe game offers 132 game variations of this basic gameplay idea, some of them for two simultaneous players. Game modes include Pinball Wiz, Crossover, Blok-Shot, Cooperation, Pro Challenge, and Double Blok, with each having variations that can include different sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even a variation where the paddle shrinks each time it hits the ball.","Publisher":"Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1978-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released"},"35182":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Rat' Mal","Region":"Germany"},{"Name":"Hangman"},{"Name":"Ordtaevling","Region":"Sweden"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Puzzle","Images":[{"FileName":"ba1066af-197e-4b1e-be83-8d309e168a68.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"e770d0a3-97de-4bab-ada7-7080e12f940a.jpg","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"ffbeb82e-4ecb-434e-9b8a-b625d77c45a8.png","Region":"North America","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"42c101a5-f0a3-4d1e-9bdb-7f2982cc2200.png","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"544f901f-b1f2-44c5-950e-072cc6192a73.png","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"b52f5d43-e36a-4c97-8543-4e507f6a4627.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"4b95d840-1e5b-431f-93d3-166adf83d33e.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":2,"Name":"Videocart-18: Hangman","Overview":"The classic game of Hangman, in which the player has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters.

Once that round of betting is done, players can then choose to discard up to three of their cards in exchange for new ones, in an attempt to make a better hand. Another round of betting then takes place and, after that, all the players that didn't fold must show their cards. Whoever has the highest hand wins all the money in the pot.","Publisher":"Zircon International, Inc.","ReleaseDate":"1981-12-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uiHD-GPv1dw"},"133385":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Schach"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"SABA","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Strategy","Images":[{"FileName":"5a91e4b1-8ac0-4769-ae00-dd2b5cb1f73c.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - 3D"},{"FileName":"fb4e76f5-0494-47f0-9803-a6dc1a75fc88.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"bcad0584-acae-4378-98f6-8716db92dcc1.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Cart - Front"},{"FileName":"9e1e054c-33b7-4408-9ed1-289ee6ebb604.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"e24adb1f-d63f-4944-a126-c1d7a237fa71.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Clear Logo"},{"FileName":"71284eff-afb9-42d0-ad22-a0082b4652bd.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title"},{"FileName":"a840d44d-fe77-4b15-8ac5-f8e2ecd418b1.png","Region":"Germany","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Videocart-20: Schach","Overview":"Schach (German for \"chess\") was released for the Saba Videoplay, a Channel F-compatible system that Fairchild licensed for the European market.\n\nIn this early chess simulation you can only play against the machine, as there is no multiplayer support. The player can chose either the white (actually green on screen) or black (actually red) pieces, and can select from 4 different AI difficulties. The easiest AI plays its turns in a matter of seconds but, as the difficulty increases, each turn can take several minutes. In the highest difficulty, the AI can take up to 50(!) minutes to decide its move. To allow the player to watch something else on the TV while the system is busy, the game cart has a very special feature: an integrated red led lights up while the machine is \"thinking\".\n\nDuring the game, the player can ask the computer to help him with his next move. In those situations, the system analyses the board and plays impartially.","Publisher":"SABA","ReleaseType":"Released","ReleaseYear":1979},"167243":{"AltNames":[{"Name":"Pacman","Region":"World"}],"Cooperative":"false","Developer":"Blackbird","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"Action","Images":[{"FileName":"7f4aa53a-752c-4c08-8dda-4563fad4ea09.jpg","Region":"World","Type":"Box - Front"},{"FileName":"2b57341c-c7e4-49a6-bc63-732d03da9bf5.png","Type":"Clear Logo"}],"MaxPlayers":1,"Name":"Videocart-27: Pac-Man","Overview":"This Pac-Man homebrew was developed by Blackbird with help from e5frog.

Those two games are:\n\nHockey\nHockey is an extended version of the Pong concept. Two players try to get the ball to land in their opponent's goal. The paddles can be moved not only up and down, but all across the playfield. They can even be tilted to have the ball reflect in another direction. In addition to the main paddles, both players also have a special goal keeper paddle that they can move up and down between the poles. There are four ball speeds to choose from. Matches end when either one of the players reaches a score of 15, or after a time limit of 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes. If the game ends in a tie, the players can decide to play 1 minute of overtime.\n\nTennis\nTennis, is a simple Pong variant. Two players compete by passing back and forth a ball with paddles. If a player misses the ball, his opponent gets a point. In Tennis, the players can choose from 4 different game speeds. A round can be configured to end as soon as one player reaches a score of 15, or after a time limit of 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes.","Publisher":"Fairchild Semiconductor","ReleaseDate":"1979-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","ReleaseType":"Released","VideoURL":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xc3NOzNj35w"}}
