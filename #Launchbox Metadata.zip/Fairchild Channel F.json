Those two games are:\n\nHockey\nHockey is an extended version of the Pong concept. Two players try to get the ball to land in their opponent's goal. The paddles can be moved not only up and down, but all across the playfield. They can even be tilted to have the ball reflect in another direction. In addition to the main paddles, both players also have a special goal keeper paddle that they can move up and down between the poles. There are four ball speeds to choose from. Matches end when either one of the players reaches a score of 15, or after a time limit of 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes. If the game ends in a tie, the players can decide to play 1 minute of overtime.\n\nTennis\nTennis, is a simple Pong variant. Two players compete by passing back and forth a ball with paddles. If a player misses the ball, his opponent gets a point. In Tennis, the players can choose from 4 different game speeds. A round can be configured to end as soon as one player reaches a score of 15, or after a time limit of 2, 5, 10, or 20 minutes.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc3NOzNj35w","Platform":"Fairchild Channel F","ESRB":null,"Genres":" Action; Sports","Developer":"Fairchild Semiconductor","Publisher":"Fairchild Semiconductor","ReleaseDate":"1979-11-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":197230,"FileName":"74a2af97-be10-4253-94d5-52cf19dd05aa.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":197230,"FileName":"83f8beb3-f5a3-4a9e-a50e-0658a8f0b252.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":197230,"AlternateName":"Channel F (included games)","Region":"North America"}]},{"DatabaseID":195146,"Name":"Democart","ReleaseYear":"1977","Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fairchild Channel F","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Fairchild Semiconductor","Publisher":"Fairchild Semiconductor","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195146,"FileName":"de3b6c65-9609-438e-a657-9689e719d2d3.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195146,"FileName":"c2c97761-592f-4b53-9b62-2e6c21bbd6ae.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195146,"FileName":"0e439341-7e4d-47c7-a67e-c560d4c1f8ab.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195146,"FileName":"219b6eca-dd71-445a-bad4-45c0d0d7fcae.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":195146,"AlternateName":"Democart 1","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":195147,"Name":"Democart 2","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":null,"MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fairchild Channel F","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":"","Developer":"Fairchild Semiconductor","Publisher":"Fairchild Semiconductor","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":195147,"FileName":"6e65a11e-7463-4b4d-939c-deab3f121d4e.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":195147,"FileName":"c906f394-79dd-472f-9172-3feac77da034.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":195147,"FileName":"8a57f8ba-1d34-4a11-a2d1-a579ab380b62.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"United States"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":194316,"Name":"Tetris","ReleaseYear":"2004","Overview":"Tetris on the Fairchild Channel F.

The basic gameplay features the player bouncing a ball off of a paddle into a wall of bricks, chipping them off one brick at a time. Each brick destroyed earns the player points with the low green bricks being worth 1 point each, the middle blue bricks being worth 4 points each, and the red bricks on top rewarding 7 points each. Once the ball bounces off the wall of bricks, it's up to the player to maneuver the paddle under the falling ball in order to hit it back up into the wall of bricks. The player loses a life if he happens to miss hitting the ball with his paddle and it falls into the abyss. The game ends when 7 balls are lost. To keep up with the pinball motif, the wall of bricks are referred to as different colored skill lanes, the walls on the side that the ball can bounce off of are labeled side rails, and the paddle is referred to as a flipper.\n\nThe game offers 132 game variations of this basic gameplay idea, some of them for two simultaneous players. Game modes include Pinball Wiz, Crossover, Blok-Shot, Cooperation, Pro Challenge, and Double Blok, with each having variations that can include different sized paddles, ball speeds, invisible bricks, and even a variation where the paddle shrinks each time it hits the ball.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"Fairchild Channel F","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.","Publisher":"Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp.","ReleaseDate":"1978-04-01T00:00:00-08:00","Images":[{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"e99a7cbf-8e42-4003-ab96-b43f7a82adbe.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"81a520c0-1ed4-4f3c-96dc-f45b68aa9d54.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"76974fb4-3076-4d15-b5e4-3d37e088ee3d.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"6bc0d8b5-ef0b-49df-886c-22db29483efc.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"32816f9f-90fc-4ad4-b596-64ea615831f6.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"56011af7-1807-492b-ba54-7b1edd0fd87d.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35181,"FileName":"655c9124-79f9-4cf2-9a46-0bd27d3ce371.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":35181,"AlternateName":"Pinball Challenge","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":35182,"Name":"Videocart-18: Hangman","ReleaseYear":null,"Overview":"The classic game of Hangman, in which the player has to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters.
