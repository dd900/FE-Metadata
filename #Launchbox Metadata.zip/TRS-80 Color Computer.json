The extra memory is used to add in another feature of the original arcade game, speech, which is featured in its Microdeal title, Talking Android Attack.\n\nLike in Berzerk, you are a lone humanoid in a large complex with lots of maze-like rooms. Your objective is to survive, and earn points by exterminating all the hostile robots that inhabit the complex. Shooting a robot (before it shoots you) turns it into a heap of deadly scrap, which will reanimate after a short while, though not into the android it once was, but into a ghost. The ghosts can pass through walls and try to fulfill the mission of their former life. This is a slight deviation from the original Berzerk, where the ghost was a separate character named \"Evil Otto\". Another difference is that in this version, you can jump and duck to avoid robot bullets.\n\nAnother peril in the game is the walls, which are electrified. By sacrificing an energy unit, of which you need at least three, you can open up a hole in the wall to pass through. On each screen there is also a crown, which can be picked up for 100 points. Killing an android gives 50 points, and killing its ghost gives you another 100. By eliminating all enemies and picking up the crown and exiting the room, you are granted a bonus sum calculated from the remaining time (when it reaches zero, you are killed). For every 10000 points, you earn another energy unit. If you leave the room without having killed the enemies, the computer will say in wobbly 6-bit speech, \"Coward!\".","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD8n-aEveCw","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Spectral Associates","Publisher":"Spectral Associates","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":175452,"FileName":"ac5c1b2a-70af-4469-90b3-2e27dcfc3c70.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":175452,"FileName":"ee778dd8-9470-494d-99ee-daaf5fdaacec.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175452,"FileName":"160dbc86-3c8c-4f5f-892f-41c9393c3c25.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":175452,"FileName":"a33bf1a6-6c07-4f75-9a92-dea106e29584.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[{"DatabaseID":175452,"AlternateName":"Talking Android Attack","Region":null}]},{"DatabaseID":175978,"Name":"Androne","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Androne is a Radio Shack cartridge game that involves you travelling a 3D maze battling monsters.

Capture an object within that loop, and you score points. Objects continue to appear on the screen, and stay until you circle them. Capture more than one object in the same loop and your reward is multiplied.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is in avoiding the objects. Your line segment can run into itself and the edge of the map, but not one of the objects you're trying to circle. That ends your turn. Play becomes a trick of turning tighter and tighter circles to capture objects before they disappear, but not too tightly as to run into them. You can vary your speed, and correspondingly the length of your line segment, by the distance your joystick is from its center. The result is that at maximum speed and length, your line turns widely.\n\nFurther increasing the challenge is that the objects move. Apples and cherries are nice and stationary, but the magnets drift slowly. The roller skates skate. Then the yo-yo's appear, doing what yo-yo's do. Timing becomes important. The final complication is the skulls. They're worth no points and they don't go away until you crash. You just have to dodge them and keep circling the moving objects.

The game uses a text parser that the player uses to input commands to explore the island.\n\nThe game supports saving and loading.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Scott Shumway","Publisher":"Usborne Publishing Limited","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":168229,"FileName":"68becada-7fcf-4068-b3d1-5a9059fff046.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168229,"FileName":"929f5e36-10ce-4ec9-be52-a70d1d59c12d.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"Europe"},{"DatabaseID":168229,"FileName":"2e776105-721d-4c77-bb3f-ac2e0260d015.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176045,"Name":"Kids on Keys","ReleaseYear":"1984","Overview":"Kids on Keys is one of a line of educational games that Spinnaker Software did for multiple machines, and was sold through Radio Shack/Tandy.

He used to be in the software business, but decided to leave everything behind as he moved to the city of Lost Wages in pursuit of sexual fulfillment. Clad in a white polyester leisure suit, Larry finds himself outside of Lefty's Bar, determined to finally lose his virginity - or commit suicide if he is unable to achieve that goal before dawn.\n\nLeisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure, though with a greatly enhanced script containing more humorous descriptions and dialogue. The gameplay is similar to other third-person Sierra adventures: a text parser is used to input commands for interaction with a graphical environment. Progress is achieved by collecting various items and figuring out which of those may be essential for conquering the hearts of the several female characters appearing in the game.\n\nThe game allows the player to access most of its locations (a bar, a casino, a convenience store, etc.) from the very beginning, with only a few key ones being barred due to the lack of a crucial item. Moving between some of the locations can only be done by cab. Paying for those trips, as well as procuring some of the items, requires the player to manage Larry's finance by gambling at the casino. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions. There are several ways to die in the game, most presented in a humorous fashion. The game contains adult situations and semi-implicit depictions of sex.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbALuYgicg8","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","Publisher":"Sierra On-Line, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":180718,"FileName":"05b24f54-f9e7-49bf-a5e2-4563ddaad51a.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":180718,"FileName":"208776cc-cf92-489e-8a9d-cd155f3e8ac1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":175983,"Name":"Math Bingo","ReleaseYear":"1980","Overview":"Math Bingo is an educational math game for one or two players, and is one of the very first games released by Radio Shack/Tandy.

The game does not actually offer escape from the maze; the best you can hope for is vengeance and a high score.\n\nAt first glance your perspective is top-down, looking down at the walls of the maze, but your man, the monsters, and the treasure, are all shown from the side.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjqkvFcfiKI","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Shooter","Developer":"Image Producers, Inc.","Publisher":"Tandy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"9f4e9039-989e-4e18-99c7-4b91b490ee5f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"89bcda1e-1410-4c5e-945a-70889938c064.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"8028eace-171c-44cb-a0c3-1188aea78d62.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"1642b54f-b05d-48cd-a689-1f52a9940cb3.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"a8fc48b6-9fb0-4f0a-8919-014c8677c809.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"0eb88cb8-85fb-45d5-8117-87ec37dc2e31.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32424,"FileName":"185298fd-3346-4a84-9ed9-024f28429fc1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176083,"Name":"Music","ReleaseYear":"1980","Overview":"Have you ever had a tune running around in your head that you wanted to write down, but you didn't know anything about music? \n\nNow, using the TRS-80 Color Computer Music program, you can not only write melody lines, but harmony as well.

The game also goes through the entire 8 color palette of the Coco 1/2, enabling you to have night bombing and other effects (you get them in sets of 2; and they go through in palette order). As you progress, you also get many more waves of missiles coming at you, and missiles that split into multiple missiles on their way down. A very well done version. The game shared the joystick (for positioning where you are firing), with the keyboard (3 different keys to match your subs), and featured two sets of keys... so in a 2 player game, each person would be on a different side of the keyboard.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Osj9Z95CJNc","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Device Oriented Games","Publisher":"Tandy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"628a57a4-21c5-43e8-b068-684babc1506f.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"64e4e9e7-10ce-40cb-bc64-9723b70e8e99.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"c87633eb-bf2b-4b71-bae2-9e9d074c3870.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"3ba77974-4904-41d6-933b-8fa1da90c1e7.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"c6719b0f-24d1-44b5-b79f-c01880923161.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"f72c90db-66d7-46a2-8d5e-a1dfd55406fa.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"2edad96b-1137-44ca-aa25-30cf8d1dd0a1.jpg","Type":"Fanart - Box - Front","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"14fb35b2-148c-4311-9417-5f508963ca92.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"e41aa9c1-eb98-4269-83d8-3e208ac12368.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"c3bf9c69-2290-4a54-a637-f250dc88cb8b.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32426,"FileName":"fcc0307c-bdd5-448b-b09a-c2d60e39d6bd.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32427,"Name":"Poltergeist","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Poltergeist is based on the hit movie of the same name... one of the rare official movie/tv adaptations done for the Coco.

Mrs. Pig rides up and down in a cable car, shooting at wolves, who are riding balloons downward, towards the ground. If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.

Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair. Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall. Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present. Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.","MaxPlayers":"2","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkIUa7mh5L8","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Datasoft, Inc.","Publisher":"Datasoft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"4e5ba6de-a917-4966-9b67-d4d931ac9dd0.jpg","Type":"Advertisement Flyer - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"0c00eeec-f1dc-403a-8fdd-dd9117567302.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"7bc25165-66e6-46ac-a0d6-3268f6370afb.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"b7af0278-8d91-4580-a2db-251c68e44a51.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"6f72c0a9-2f02-4bab-8dbf-9e7beeda959c.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"c5a23004-fa02-4e1d-a10c-b46bf29a50e9.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"b1785ede-1344-41ea-a4be-4cb98c0bf2cb.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"c5bc9f93-48c8-4944-8593-04a0d36af346.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":187782,"FileName":"26c6989f-c9e1-4122-8bee-708c9b423dcf.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32428,"Name":"Popcorn!","ReleaseYear":"1981","Overview":"Popcorn! is a game based on the 1978 arcade game Avalanche by Atari (which itself spawned the Atari 2600 hit, Kaboom!).

It also scaled the ships well; at times, they could more than fill the screen.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Robert G.

Although it used a fairly lo-res Coco 3 graphics mode (160x192 16 color), it actually looked pretty good, graphics wise. The sound was fairly rudimentary, and the controls (either on joystick or keyboard) were a little awkward, but the gameplay was a lot of fun, and pretty difficult. The meltdown sequence when you win the game was quite impressive as well. Basically, you are a survivor of the human race, after a nuclear war, and aliens have just invaded (as if the war wasn't bad enough). At the beginning, you are only armed with rocks to throw at the beings, but your first mission is to wander through the forest trying to hunt down some advanced technology left behind by your race from before the war. The suit can recharge you, and also can eventually be made to fly, fire, and serve as an anti-radiation device, all by finding the appropriate power packs, and installing them in the suit. By doing all of that, you can eventually go to the top of the radioactive volcano, and defeat the alien masters, and save the human race.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cdbn4mMDQc","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action; Platform","Developer":"Palace Software","Publisher":"Epyx","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"3ac90f2e-3855-4295-868b-9b18cb37b20d.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"41bc310f-c961-48ae-b635-2d5e3546d629.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"68824b08-3a89-411a-9a45-eae5898a0454.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"384eb144-7152-4553-ac33-a1180185487f.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"26fcee06-f56c-4e59-8edc-e7325af15062.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"b63f0f20-ad4e-46f4-80dd-60747935a1c5.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":35151,"FileName":"14f623e6-cba7-4251-94d1-bbacb6c50615.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":35149,"Name":"Rampage","ReleaseYear":"1989","Overview":"Rampage! is an officially licensed version of the arcade game smash (pun intended) of the same name.

Instead of a Colt 45 Peacemaker, your weapon is the FSS Demona, perhaps the best starship in the depleted Federation fleet.\n\nThe Demona has shields, hyperspace drive, and deadly lasers which can blast a barbarian raider out of existence with a single shot. Their hits, by contrast, will just scratch her shields, which you can easily reinforce with more energy. Energy is the catch, though. Every shot and hyperspace jump consumes an appreciable amount, while life support drains the ship as steadily as a clock ticks. More than their lasers, the barbarians' maneuverability is their deadliest weapon. Get a little too eager with your rapid-fire lasers and you'll have nothing left for that pesky life support system. Take too long to destroy all the enemies in your patrol zone, and they'll slip through to lay waste to the Federation's most populous planets.\n\nA single supply ship exists, which you can visit as often as you need. Just make sure you don't run out of gas getting there or lining up with its fuel pod. Hyperspace jumps also take a certain deftness. While dogfights within a sector range across unlimited three-dimensional space, hyperspace is flat and there'll be no jumping with the Demona's nose pointing off the galactic plane. Heading and azimuth are on the main screen, which is dominated by a view of the starry void, complete with crosshairs. When you do jump successfully, those stars disappear, then slowly expand from a thin, horizontal line as you enter the new sector. Energy, shields, and sensor readings are packed into the main screen, too. Separately, a map is available showing enemy presence in the sectors you have scanned, along with the location of that vital supply ship.\n\nDogfights rest on interpreting the trajectory of the barbarian raiders in order to draw them into your crosshairs and meet them there with a slightly anticipatory laser blast. Fifteen levels of difficulty are available; at higher levels an occasional second raider in the sector can make their shots a genuine hazard. Nonetheless, the primary challenge of higher difficulty is life support's rate of energy consumption. With the energy level ticking down faster, each dogfight becomes a race to target the enemy raider and return to the supply ship while there's still air in your lungs.","MaxPlayers":null,"ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Shooter","Developer":"Microcomputer Games, Inc.","Publisher":"The Avalon Hill Game Company","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":172850,"FileName":"01b4eff8-efa2-4c85-aedf-5f74431520fd.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172850,"FileName":"7127f819-ec16-4521-a9c5-f2ffccfeabee.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172850,"FileName":"019bf6cd-cebd-4a25-a9fd-561adc90c324.jpg","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":172850,"FileName":"272e790d-1932-4740-a616-df5b1ee29b3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172850,"FileName":"d69daa83-82b3-44fc-94a2-e349c6809445.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":172850,"FileName":"76354d2c-b10a-4242-98b6-a7fd4c102f3c.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176068,"Name":"Silpheed","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Silpheed is an arcade game that was a cross-platform hit.

You have to navigate through sets of flags to the finish line as fast as you can. The position of the flags and hills is random, and you can generate new random courses from the main menu. You can also set the mode of play: simple or complex. In simple, moving the joystick forward speeds you up forward, pulling all the way back slows you to a stop, and left/right steers. Your maximum speed is not too high in this mode, so you can steer fairly easily, but wt will take you at least 1:10 to 1:30 to get to the finish line. In complex mode, hitting the joystick button is the equivalent of you giving yourself a thrust with your ski poles; now you can go MUCH faster, but your steering at high speeds is not very good. If you ram the button, you can make it to the finish line within 15 seconds. Unfortunately, if you go off course, or miss steering between flags, your score will not count.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Sports","Developer":"Robert G.

Your mission: travel to the desert planet of Roloc and investigate the Temple of ROM. Your equipment: a scroll (which contains instructions from the game's manual) and a laser.\n\nTwo missions have gone before you. Technology has improved since then, allowing electronic scans of the temple structure. It is a maze, and there is activity. Two million years ago a society steeped in wealth and the magic occupied the planet. Legend has it that they left behind a curse protecting their temples and the valuable artifacts contained within. Your purpose is \"to enrich the present by expanding our knowledge of the experiences and achievements of this past civilization.\"\n\nIn game terms, this means blasting monsters and collecting treasure. Poisonous spiders and sentient fireballs occupy the rooms of the temple, while giant bats patrol overhead, swooping down when they spot you. Enticing you onward are golden cups, jade crosses, diamond rings, crystal goblets, and silver pitchers. Magical treasures such as crystal balls and golden crowns will for a time render you invisible and boost your laser, respectively.\n\nNo small challenge is the maze itself, eerily reminiscent of a colossal computer chip. You have an overhead view, but only of a small portion, and it doesn't scroll until you're near the edge. The result is that while moving into new territory, you see only a half-dozen paces ahead. There are a few pairs of transfer portals, which will zap you across the maze, but as often with archeology, your investigation relies on legwork. The maze, occupants, and treasures are constant each play, so over time you can come to know the temple well, and your laser very well.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oY0oj4C5AI","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Action","Developer":"Rick Adams","Publisher":"Tandy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"142c80ea-984d-4e3b-aab0-3648292ef4b2.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"42afd1e6-448a-4acb-808a-b44ba12a2d1b.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"fe63be5c-15d5-4b55-9bf7-5bf6ff4914f7.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"fb902be8-6c99-4a90-808e-4d4fcd6e8422.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"1d557428-4d10-4a40-8c8c-a68d82b78c94.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"b59592be-3b20-4d06-902e-a51cb469ab37.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":32437,"FileName":"82068afb-0845-4dda-aa4b-26bac8f43ff2.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":32438,"Name":"Tennis","ReleaseYear":"1982","Overview":"Tennis is a simple version of 2 player tennis.

In any case, this game situates you as a private investigator hired by Sue Ellen to find a map to hidden oil fields, in hopes to accumulate enough wealth to escape the sinister influence of J.R. Sue Ellen offers you a reward of $2 million for the map. You snoop around the grounds of the South Fork Ranch, superficially interacting with much-loved characters from the TV show and an assortment of extras from the animal kingdom. You must avoid J.R. who would like to put a stop to Sue Ellen's plans. So far, so good.\n\nYour travels ultimately lead you to the jungles around Playa Peligro, in South America, where you overcome a series of obstacles by using various techniques, but mostly by doping a friendly monkey with tobacco -- a firm reminder that we're descending beneath even soap opera plot conflicts and sitting squarely in an early-'80s text adventure game, with all of the internal logic-twisting that entails.","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yd_Pe183lU","Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Adventure","Developer":"Datasoft, Inc.","Publisher":"Datasoft, Inc.","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"86401f6d-b71c-4ba0-9ae7-ea540c1742e2.jpg","Type":"Box - Back","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"1935af21-6c88-4c0e-9f65-a227554c6927.jpg","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"40b7f239-6dea-4bd7-949f-7f1ce4e63752.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"6a6b1e37-950f-4c7a-87b6-920910b0b161.jpg","Type":"Disc","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"4c6c81e5-f86a-4e7b-ba28-8d49485d1012.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Over","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"f2c8e5c7-f46b-4531-b3bb-925f5f04e0de.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"1b940a4f-3dc8-4bf8-a0f1-90cb8dedb785.png","Type":"Screenshot - Game Title","Region":null},{"DatabaseID":197667,"FileName":"2777169b-07fa-4234-bc66-2b0f045497f1.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":null}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":176079,"Name":"Thexder","ReleaseYear":"1988","Overview":"Thexder is an arcade game that was a major cross-platform hit, selling hundreds of thousands of copies.

On the other hand, it looked really nice, and was also one of the few games that was later ported to OS-9/NitrOS9. An interesting tidbit: From Alan's recoding of the game, it appears that it originally WAS written for OS-9 (internal calls were set up suspicously like OS-9 System calls, etc.), and only changed to RS-DOS at the last moment, probably to expand the market it was aimed at (no disk drive needed, only 128K needed). While Alan converted it, he also added a few options: Invincibility, and multiple speed levels (including some faster than the original cartridge version).","MaxPlayers":"1","ReleaseType":"Released","Cooperative":"false","VideoURL":null,"Platform":"TRS-80 Color Computer","ESRB":"Not Rated","Genres":" Platform","Developer":"Synergistic Software","Publisher":"Tandy Corporation","ReleaseDate":null,"Images":[{"DatabaseID":176079,"FileName":"d351770c-f2fe-4fba-9096-542dba4aa56e.png","Type":"Box - 3D","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176079,"FileName":"f21d168a-0ab8-4845-a941-ca257e1a1659.png","Type":"Box - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176079,"FileName":"1c74cb3f-2911-4637-9f15-0cb792d33f4a.png","Type":"Cart - Back","Region":"United States"},{"DatabaseID":176079,"FileName":"fa6765c0-0a41-4212-b064-d9fe9d4baf35.png","Type":"Cart - Front","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176079,"FileName":"8c9e951a-f97b-414d-b558-757a8c7cdc8d.png","Type":"Clear Logo","Region":"North America"},{"DatabaseID":176079,"FileName":"bcadd2d6-b08f-473c-a2af-d30706c93770.png","Type":"Screenshot - Gameplay","Region":"North America"}],"AlternateNames":[]},{"DatabaseID":197945,"Name":"Time Bandit","ReleaseYear":"1983","Overview":"Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.\n\nHaving nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced preview of the concept getting famous with Gauntlet two years later.
