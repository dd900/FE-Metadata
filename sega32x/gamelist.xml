    <name>After Burner Complete ~ After Burner </name>
    <desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

    <desc>Blackthorne is an action-adventure game that takes place on the planet Tuul. Tuul was a peaceful place, until the evil warrior Sarlac used the power of the Darkstone to take control.  Blackthorne's father, the good King Vlaros, sent him to Earth just as his kingdom crumbled around him.  Now, 20 years later, Blackthorne is grown and must return to Tuul to free it from the clutches of Sarlac.

This game is played from a side-view with non-scrolling backgrounds. It has strong similarities to Prince of Persia, except you battle your foes using guns and bombs instead of a sword.</desc>

    <desc>Cosmic Carnage is a one-on-one fighting game set in outer space.  The story begins as a prison barge is hijacked by it's cargo in an escape attempt.  The resulting chaos caused the barge to crash into a military cruiser. The impact caused extensive damage to both ships.  There were only 8 survivors, 4 from each ship.  What's worse, there's only one escape pod.  You control one of the 8 survivors, and have to finish off all the others to escape with your life.

The gameplay in Cosmic carnage is similar to Street Fighter 2, but with a much slower pace.  Some of the fighters can be customized with different armor combinations, allowing them access to different special moves.</desc>

    <name>Darxide  </name>
    <desc>One of the last 32X games released (and exclusively in Europe), DarXide is a 3-D space shooter, inspired in part by the arcade gameplay of Asteroids. It is one of the few 32X games to used texture-mapped polygons. 

Players control a lone starship rushing to destroy oncoming asteroids and alien vessels before they annihilate defenseless human miners and colonies. Asteroids break apart into smaller rocks, which much also be hunted down and destroyed. Aliens likewise arrive in larger, more dangerous vessels.

Asteroids broken down to their smallest size and then vaporized will sometimes drop shield or energy recharges, to repair damage caused by laser blasts or collisions. New weapons can also be found. Players have a time limit to meet all objectives in a stage before they are forced to land and try again. The right side of the HUD shows asteroids remaining (and their approximate size), while the left shows the player's distance to their base (and so, time remaining in the stage).</desc>

    <desc>It's 5 years after the formation of the Worldwide Federation.  Although war has been averted, terrorist cells around the world threaten the stability of the federation.  To combat this menace, the Federation has created a bi-pedal armored tank known as the Metal Head.  You are a Metal Head pilot, and you have to use all the weapons at your disposal to take out the terrorists.

Metal Head is a bit of a variation on the usual giant robot combat game.  The game's mission areas bear more resemblance to a first-person shooter than a simulation.  The graphics are all rendered in texture mapped polygons, which is unusual for a 32X game.</desc>

    <desc>This 32X-exclusive sci-fi shooter has gameplay is somewhat like Sega arcade classic Zaxxon. The graphics consist of a diagonally scrolling playfield which creates a pseudo 3D environment.  The backgrounds are drawn using 2D scrolling planes, but the enemy and ship objects are drawn using 3D flat-shaded polygons.

Although the basic goal of each of the 9 levels is to shoot everything without getting shot, the game has a strategic element.  Your basic spacecraft has very little firepower, and can only sustain one hit.  To make matters worse, there are very few power-ups.  In order to survive, you have to jump on top of enemies and take control of their weapons systems.  This system allows for a large variety of player-controllable ships.</desc>

    <name>Virtua Hamster  </name>
    <desc>Virtua Hamster is a unreleased Sega 32X game. The game was to star a variety of selectable rodents attached to rocket packs who could travel through a series of connected tubes, fighting each other and avoiding various obstacles.

It was built solely with the 32X in mind, however after the console failed development moved to the Sega Saturn for a short while before being axed completely. It is also reported that Sega of Japan were not keen on use of the "Virtua" in the game's name, possibly so that the game was not associated with Sega AM2's Virtua Fighter and Virtua Racing. An alternate box mock-up uses the title Virtual Hamster instead.

In August 2009, Ryo Suzuki of SEGASaturno.com dumped an early prototype version of this game. In it, the only selectable character is hamster, Chip, and there is only one empty level (though there are numerous non-moving 3D models of other characters and items dotted around the map). A resets the game, and B/C can be used to move the camera forwards and backwards through the tube. There are also two Sega screens.</desc>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.

Although it is a wrestling title, this game is structured a lot like a one-on-one fighter. It is very fast-paced, and features crazy special moves. Also, each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, each round simply ends when you force the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and vs mode for 1-on-1 multiplayer. </desc>
