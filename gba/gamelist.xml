    <desc>This GBA version of Ace Lightning is based on the BBC TV show of the same name which is a mixture of CGI and live action. It first plays from an overhead view of an Amusement Park where you can enter open doors which lead to 12 different themed worlds. Each world is a 2D side-scrolling platformer, where you face different enemies and end-level bosses all in your quest to find the Gold Amulet.  Once you finish a certain number of the levels,  you'll be rewarded with one of two mini-games. One is a target range where you have to shoot a number of enemies within a certain time. The other is a strength test where Ace must swing to hit a bell at the top of a pole.</desc>

Every of the 13 courses also has various special challenges, e.g. collecting or smashing certain items, which need to be performed to beat it. In contrast to the open areas of the console versions this one features more linear levels and tight time limits. 

It also replaces the "juice meter" with the so-called "grind meter" which is filled up by performing stunts. Every grind decreases this meter and if it is empty no grinds can be performed at all. Of course grinds are an elemental move to beat the challenges. 
There is also a freestyle playing mode where the player can unlock new skaters.

    <name>Alien Hominid  </name>
    <desc>You're a little yellow alien.  The FBI has shot down your ship while flying over planet Earth.  And it, quite literally, lands right on their doorstep.  After a series of FBI Agents swipe your ship, what option do you have other than to blow up everything in your path to get it back?

Alien Hominid is a 2D side-scrolling shooter with heavy references to the Metal Slug series of games - from the hand-drawn graphics, huge explosions, right down to the ability to eviscerate FBI Agents when you get up close to them.  The graphics are by featured artist Dan Paladin.  Your goal, is quite simply, to get to the end of the stage, and die as little as possible.  Which is made difficult due to the fact that any bullet is an instant kill.

To help you out, you can grab a range of power-ups, such as lasers, spread shots, shotguns and more, as well as hijacking vehicles and using them for protection.  Grenades can be lobbed, and you can jump on enemy shoulders and choose to bite their heads off if you like, or pick them up and throw them at other enemies.  You can also dive underground for a short period of time to avoid enemies - while underground, you can drag agents into the ground to kill them.

The GBA version of the game is identical in gameplay, however, with a few bosses removed (such as the robot bee and the FBI big-fisted tank robot).  The PlayStation 2, Xbox and Xbox 360 versions of the game include a special "PDA Game" with very simple-looking graphics.  Your goal in this game is to kill all the agents by hopping on their heads, and then reach the exit.  Included with this game is a level editor, allowing you to make your own levels and then send them to friends if you have the Xbox or Xbox 360 version.</desc>

    <name>Asterix &amp; Obelix - Bash Them All!  </name>
    <desc>Asterix &amp; Obelix: Bash Them All! is a 2D side-scrolling platform game based on the French comic series Astérix. It is a collection of two games. One old, namely a port of the SNES game Asterix and Obelix. The other game is called Asterix &amp; Cleopatra, based on the comic and animated movie of the same name. 
 
In Asterix and Cleopatra, Asterix has to help a Egyptian architect Artifis to build his pyramid for Cleopatra. You play typical platform levels where you jump around obstacles and walk towards the right of the screen. Many enemies such as fake building contractors and Roman soldiers (sent by a jealous Caesar), and pirates have to be bashed into the sky. Each level is concluded with a mini-game. The game closely follows the events of the comic.</desc>

    <name>Atomic Betty </name>
    <desc>Atomic Betty is a mix of the platform and puzzle genres, and plays very similarly to The Lost Vikings, in that you control three different characters simultaneously, each with varying abilities. 
 
 
However, because Atomic Betty is aimed at a younger audience, there are two notable differences: first, it is a lot more difficult to die, and second, the player only needs to get one character to the exit to successfully finish the level. When on Earth, the player controls one character that can finish the homework, one that can push or pull objects, and the last that can slide under narrow gaps.  
 
In Space, one character can repeatedly attack and use special gadgets, one can use a jetpack for a very high jump, and the last can grab items and enemies. In addition to the main levels, the game also features levels where the player must control the spaceship as it zooms through asteroid belts and high-speed space warps.</desc>

    <name>Bionicle Heroes  </name>
    <desc>In the GBA version of Bionicle Heroes, based on the LEGO Bionicle franchise, players take on the guise of the TOA Anika team. Set on the island of Voya Nui, they need to retrieve the Mask of Life, stolen by the Piraka race who also enslaved the Matoran, the native inhabitants, in the process. Unlike the console and the DS versions, a top-down perspective is used.

The game takes place on six zones of the island, followed by a final showdown. The player starts as a TOA of Fire, but by completing zones and killing the level boss, additional masks can be collected: Air, Stone, Ice, Earth and Water. Each TOA has a primary and secondary weapon based on the mask's elemental nature, with specific features. During the levels, there are also weapon upgrades to be found. The second weapon is limited by an energy meter which needs some time to recharge. Each zone requires a specific TOA guise, but in the Free Play mode completed levels can be revisited and players can then switch between the forms at any time to use different abilities. TOAs can strafe while fighting - there is an option to face enemies automatically or to control this manually.

TOAs are assisted by proto-spawn orbs, sidekicks that circle around the hero and fire at enemies. The orbs are chased off when they take too much damage, but they can also be upgraded based on the 6 elements and the weapons can be customized. Players can define to have the orbs fire in spread patterns or rapid bursts, lock on targets with fire, cause explosions, fire through shields or do double damage. Additional attacks are provided through elemental runes, which provide a one-time limited effect, such as freezing enemies, activating a lightning shield, smashing enemies with spikes from the ground, temporary invulnerability, full health and regeneration, and a fire blast.

By destroying objects and buildings in the environment, blue, gray or gold LEGO pieces are revealed, providing health and bonus points. The TOAs also need to use pieces to build bridges, platforms, elevators, turrets, barricades or moving platforms. At the end of each zone, the rank and score is shown. Based on the performance or specific actions, there are 12 medals to collect, of which a few can only be found in the Free Play mode.

Each zone contains secret cheat words. Upon discovering them, they are added to a cheat menu. They allow to play as a golden TOA or to obtain a new mask with a sombrero, open up a music jukebox, provide a hidden Cluck gun or grant invincibility or one-shot kills.</desc>

    <name>bit Generations - Boundish  </name>
    <desc>bit Generations: Boundish is a Game Boy Advance video game released in July of 2006. It was released as part of the bit Generations games, and was only released in Japan. The game can be easily compared to the game Pong, though it features many gameplay differences, graphical enhancements (despite the graphics themselves being deliberately primitive), and sounds. 
 
In the game, you'll take control of two paddles, each moving when the other one does. The goal is to keep the ball within the playing field. Allowing it to exit will result in a gameover. In all, there are five stages, each one containing different concepts though having the basic overall objective. For example, in the Wild Go Round you'll control a ball on a moving record. Because the record is moving, it'll alter the direction of the ball at pivotal moments, which will require the player to be quick on his feet and act appropriately. In all, the game's modes include Pool Flower, Box Juggling, Power Slide, Human League, and Wild Go Round. For players who wish to play multiplayer they can link with another Game Boy Advance with just a single cartridge. In multiplayer, all of the stages excluding Box Juggling are available for play.</desc>

    <desc>bit Generations: Coloris is a Game Boy Advance video game that was released exclusively in Japan. It was part of the second series of bit Generations video games, and is simply just a basic puzzle video game. In the game, you'll be required to place three similarly colored tiles next to each other in order to rid of them. However, unlike most games like this, you don't swap the tiles but rather start to change the color of the tile by pressing on them with the cursor. 
 
Each step of the game the cursor will be one of the three colors that are in play. If there's a red, blue and purple tile, then clicking on a blue tile with a red cursor won't automatically turn it into that color but will rather turn it purple. By continually pressing that tile with a red cursor, however, will eventually change it into a red tile. As you progress through the game, and there will be more than just three different colors, ranking up the difficultly level.</desc>

    <desc>bit Generations: Dialhex is a Game Boy Advance video game released in 2006 by Nintendo and skip, Ltd. The game was part of the initial batch of bit Generations games. The game was not released in America or Europe, but a remake of the game, titled Art Style: ROTOHEX for the Wii's WiiWare service, was released two years later in 2008. The remake was slightly different, though was instantly recognizable to fans of Dialhex. 
 
Gameplay 
In Dialhex, you turn differently colored triangles on a playing field. The goal of the game is to turn them in a way so that you create a hexagon that contains triangles of the same color. After doing so, you'll be rewarded a set amount of points and the triangles within the hexagon will disappear, with the triangles in the surrounding areas taking their place. The board itself is in the shape of a hexagon, and triangles will continually fall down from the top. Once they hit another triangle, they'll stop moving, waiting for the player to make use of them. If the player has destroyed most of the triangles on the stage, and the amount of triangles is a bare minimum, then they can press the L and R button, or the A and B button, at the same time to cause the triangles that drop to come down faster. The triangles will also start to drop faster as the player progresses through the game. 
 
Once you start a new game, you'll be given just two colors (in the start, green and orange). After six hexagons have been created, then another color will be added to the mix, and will start to drop down from above. In all, the colors, including the ones mentioned, are green, orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, cyan, and a darker green. 
 
After you've reached a certain point in the game's main mode, you'll be given access to the title's endless mode. In endless mode, you'll keep on going for as long as you possibly can, trying to rank up as many points as possible. The game starts similarly to the title's main mode, and new colors will start to drop just as they did in that mode too. The only difference is that it never ends until the player gets a gameover. In order to unlock the staff credits, you just need to create six cyan hexagons in the game's main mode. After doing this the credits will be available on the game's main screen.</desc>

    <name>bit Generations - Orbital  </name>
    <desc>bit Generations: Orbital is a Game Boy Advance video game released exclusively in Japan as part of the second series of bit Generations titles. It is an innovative title that has the player consolidating a multitude of planets together in each stage to create on large rock. It was remade on WiiWare under the title of Art Style: ORBIENT, and was the first of at least three titles to be released in the Art Style series. 
 
Gameplay 
Before starting a stage the player will have to choose which galaxy he or she wishes to play within and then the stage. Following this your small star will shoot towards a large body with a varying amount of small stars orbiting it. The goal is to come in possession of those other stars in order to increase the size of the primary one. When ready, the player will shoot out of the orbit of a star and then be pulled into another one when he enters its range. If the player touches the star that the smaller ones are revolving around, then your star will blow up. With this said, it's suggested you constantly adjust the speed of your stara as not to rush into an orbit, ultimately causing it to crash. 
 
When one wishes to enter the orbit of a star, he'll have to press the A button, which is will "attract" your star towards it. If you don't want to enter it, then you'll have to press B, which will repel it. If the player wishes to change the position of the camera, then they can use the d-pad. 
 
When not in orbit around a star, you'll simply be floating. This is when you have to use a combination of the attract and repel buttons in order to change your direction. If you're going near a large star, then its orbit will effect the player more than a smaller one would, and you have more of a chance to start revolving around it. 
 
There are multiple obstacles in the game that are represented by the color red. Basically if it's red, you want to stay away from it. unfortunately using the repel or attract button will have no effect when you're next to an obstacle, though if a star is nearby and you're heading straight towards an obstacle, it's suggested that you get out of its way. Sometimes these hazards will even revolve around stars.</desc>

    <desc>bit Generations: Soundvoyager is a Game Boy Advance video game released in July of 2006. It was developed by skip Ltd. and published by Nintendo. The game was unfortunately never released outside of Japan. The game can be played entirely without looking at the screen, as the point is to listen to the sounds that are emitted from the Game Boy Advance's speaker. It should be noted, however, that it is quite a challenge to listen to the noises coming from the speaker, and that it's a lot easier to hook up ear phones or hook the GBA up to a stereo. It will also be very helpful to be in a quiet space.</desc>

    <name>Breath of Fire II </name>
    <desc>Ryu was a young boy who has memories of a strange village far away and a magical doorway which sucked him through. However those are only distant memories. Ryu and his best friend Bow are apprentices in the Ranger's Guild. As adventurers they take on posted jobs needed by the townspeople. However it isn't long before one job goes awry and Bow is accused of stealing a valuable item. In order to clear his friend's name and find the meaning of his dreams, Ryu will explore the world, eventually discovering the meaning of his dreams and hidden abilities inside himself.

Breath of Fire II is a role playing game. The majority of game is played from a top-down map, however battles are seen from an isometric view. Ryu will form parties from among 8 other characters, each with their own set of skills and powers that will help him discover the truth behind the mystery. 

In the GBA version, you can use a link-cable to link to a friends and exchange weapons and items to defeat the higher evils. And with the inclusion of the community system, you can build and maintain your own city while you are fed up of exploring.</desc>

The player has at his disposal all the key abilities of the cat-lady as seen in the movie, and must traverse levels full of platforms and "bad guys", and climbing walls, occasionally.

The game opens with a tutorial mission and then switches to a series of images resembling comic-strips that explain how Patience Phillips became Catwoman. The player then goes through the 24 levels of the game mostly jumping, climbing and sometimes fighting.

The look of the graphics aims toward a comic-book feel instead of the more realistic looking 3D of the console and PC versions.</desc>

1. Arcade: shoot a specific number of chickens to move on to the next level. There is no time limit and the enemies attack by throwing eggs towards the screen. There is no time limit and when Chicken Bill's 100 points are depleted, the game is over.

2. Classic: the same gameplay as Arcade, requiring a certain number of chickens to be shot, but now with a time limit added. Certain chickens carry time packages, providing time bonuses.

3. Multiplayer: score more points than your opponent in a set amount of time.

There are three difficulty levels and support for high scores (not saved after powering off). At the end of each level, statistics are shown based on the shots fired, hits, accuracy, general score, and energy or time remaining. There are different types of weapons (pistol, shotgun, uzi, machine gun, laster, flame thrower and bombs) and a limited amount of ammo. During gameplay, accuracy is shown through a thermometer on the screen. When it rises to the top, all hits are awarded with double points.</desc>

    <desc>Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until a lightning storm mysteriously brought his cartoon villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch within the pages of his own comic book. Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...

Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.

The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.</desc>

Only singleplayer is available, and no story at all. The main game modes are Grand Prix, two modes based on checkpoints (alone or against opponents), and Last Man Standing where the last one drops after each lap. Grand Prix consists of three classes based on different speed, with three cups each, and and extra cup. Controls allow for speeding up, braking, using items to hinder your opponents (mines, nails, boxing gloves...), and there is a button to drift through the corners.

    <name>CT Special Forces  </name>
    <desc>CT Special Forces is a side scrolling platform shooter that has a superficial similarity to the games of the Metal Slug series. The player controls an operative of a counter-terrorist force on a mission around the globe to stop terrorist activity and arrest its leaders. The digital pad moves the character, while the B button shoots the weapon and the A button makes the character jump. The character can't shoot downwards. The L trigger cycles through the inventory (displayed on the top-left corner of the screen) and the R trigger throws grenades (when they are available). By selecting an ammunition type, the character uses the corresponding weapon (gas canisters for the flamethrower, machine gun pents for that weapon, etc). The default rifle has an infinite number of bullets. Other items include a grappling rope and a pair of handcuffs to arrest surrended enemies. Ammunition and health packs are scattered throughout the levels, as are proximity mines and assorted enemies.

The regular gameplay is occasionally broke by mini-games and entirely different sections: when the character collides with a reticule placard, the game switches to a first-person shooting gallery where the player has to shoot down a certain number of terrorists and rescue the hostages. When colliding with a parachute, two gauges with a red line on the middle appear on the screen. The one on the left measures the position of the falling character and the one on the right measures height. The character must be guided to the right spot, and the shooting button must be pressed when both gauges reach the red bar. Some mission stages change the game to a vertical shooter that recalls Tiger-Heli and similar games, where the player controls a helicopter viewed from the top.

The game has 4 missions, each with its own theme: snow mountain, desert, jungle and a city. A password system is provided  (the password is displayed after the completion of every mission).</desc>

    <name>CT Special Forces - Bioterror  </name>
    <desc>Game Boy Advance brings CT SPECIAL FORCES 3: BIOTERROR to fans of vertical action combat game play. A special military unit called the Special Intervention Forces has but a single mission- to do away with all terrorist organizations and other menacing threats. The latest threat has to do with the fact that the enemy has in their possession a biochemical weapon that alters human DNA. They have used this chemical to strengthen hostility and athletic genes to produce an original species of insurgent. The Counter Terrorist Special Intervention Forces are the only ones who possess the strength and skill to crush this new adversary. Each player is responsible for controlling his or her member of the CT Special Forces, as each mission becomes increasingly difficult. In the latest threat of terrorism, the need for underwater soldiers has become a necessity. With scuba diving skills, the player can explore several underwater regions. Combat takes place in both the water and on land, so the game presents the player with a number of vehicle and weaponry options. Each skill is the most sophisticated available and designed to seek out and destroy the enemy. The game takes the player through 20 levels that test, challenge and drive the Special Forces towards victory. Fans of combat action games with a patriotic tone must try this intense game.</desc>

    <desc>Released in conjunction with a 3D update of the classic arcade game on consoles, the Game Boy Advance version is also an update of the original, but retains its side-scrolling gameplay.

The cartridge includes several variants of the game. The main mode is called "XGP". Its basics are the same as in the original: The player's spaceship flies left or right over a scrolling landscape that wraps around after a few screens. The goal is destroy all invading aliens before they can capture the humans sitting on the ground. Besides updated graphics with various backgrounds and sprites for the enemies and humans, there are other differences as well: players can select from different ships, all with slightly different weapons and ratings for shields and speed. The XGP mode offers six different levels to complete. It can also be played by two players over the System Link.

The cartridge also includes "Classic" mode, which is a port of the original arcade game. Finally, "XG" mode is the same gameplay-wise as Classic, but has been updated with graphics similar to the XGP mode.</desc>

    <name>Defender of the Crown </name>
    <desc>Defender of the Crown puts you in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

    <desc>The Digimon prove themselves to be versatile creatures as they hop in cars and compete against each other in this kart-style racing game.

The third Digimon game for the Game Boy Advance, Digimon Racing has all the features you'd expect out of a racing game. There's a good variety of colorful and light-hearted tracks (15 in all, including a wide variety of themes such as jungles, deserts, busy city streets, ice tracks, and gravel-covered hills), nearly a dozen Digimon to pick from and unlock, and several gameplay modes ranging from cup races to time trials. A handful of boss races round out the action, and provide a challenge for players.

The twist to this game comes as the racers collect energy on the track to digivolve into upgraded versions of themselves. Once you've digivolved, you can use additional offensive powers to further hamper your opponents and keep your own Digimon ahead of the others.

While the single-player game will keep you busy for a while with its many modes and characters, Digimon Racing really shines in the multiplayer arena. Since it includes support for up to four players using the link cable or wireless adapter, the multiplayer experience is the real highlight of the game.</desc>

In order for the park to be opened, it's up to Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy to find the magical powers and return the park back to the way it was.

In order to do this, the gang must complete various party games while travelling along the game board. Players take turns to role the dice and move their character. Certain parts of the board will open up mini-games, which must be completed to move on, and the winner is the one with the most magical power stars, which are gained by landing on blue spaces on the board.

There are four boards, each with their own theme based on an amusement park ride. Up to four players can play using the one console, or play with four consoles to challenge each other in a set of mini-games.</desc>

    <desc>King K. Rool has stolen Donkey Kong's banana stash, and Donkey Kong needs your help to get them back. In search of K. Rool, the Kremling horde impedes your progress. Kremlings, crocodile-like creatures, include Kritters (they succumb to a simple jump on the head), Krushas (they are virtually indestructible), and others. There are also other enemies that block your path, such as beavers, snakes, vultures. Leading them are dastardly bosses, including Very Gnawty, Necky, Bumble B, and Dumb Drum, and they all bar the way with their own special blend of villainy.

Donkey Kong is joined by Diddy Kong: these two primates differ significantly. For example, Donkey Kong is generally stronger; he can destroy most enemies with a single jump and can lift barrels straight over his head to throw them farther. On the other hand, Diddy is faster and not as strong as Donkey; he can run really fast and do cartwheels. Diddy carries barrels in front of him, creating a shield against frontal attacks.

The game is split into different worlds, which are split into different levels. Each level contains bonus areas, where one can collect bananas, medallions, and lives. At the end of each world is a boss, which is usually a larger version of a minor enemy.</desc>

After having single-handedly saved Mars from demonic threat, you return to Earth, only to find out that the demons have already invaded it, killed all its inhabitants or turned them into demons. It's your task to kill all the demons and to save the Earth.

Doom II looks and plays very similarly to its predecessor, utilizing the same 3D graphical engine with 2D sprites for enemies. The gameplay once again consists entirely of navigating the hero from first-person view through 3D environments and shooting at the demons while attempting to find your way out by flipping switches and looking for keys. Unlike in Doom, which is divided into three episodes, the 30 levels of Doom II (plus the 2 secret levels) form one long episode. 

You have the same weapons as in the first Doom, plus a new one: a super shotgun. There are also some new demons in this sequel, such as the chaingun-toting Heavy Weapon Dudes, the skeletal Revenants who launch homing missiles and the Arch-Viles who have a highly damaging fire attack. There is also one new power-up, a Megasphere which boosts your health and armor to the max.</desc>

    <name>Dr. Sudoku </name>
    <desc>That weird number-based game you keep seeing people play on their newspapers has come to GameBoy Advance.  Sudoku is a logic-puzzle game in which a 27x27 square is partially filled in with numbers and the object of the game is to fill in the blank squares so that every column, row and 3x3 square will have a number of 1-9 entered...without repeating.

Dr. Sudoku features 1,000 puzzles crafted by the leading developer of Sudoku, Skynet Corporation of Japan.  If you are new to the game, have no fear - in addition to readily available hints, Dr. Sudoku has a tutorial mode that will guide you through the game. You can also ask the doctor to verify if a puzzle is actually solvable.

Another feature is "Original Mode" that allows you to create your own puzzles (this allows you to transfer puzzles you see in the newspaper onto your GBA).</desc>

But little do they know that Duke Nukem is back and on their case, and he'll be travelling around the world, from Egypt to Australia, to make sure he's shot, frozen and/or stamped on every one of these creeps; and pick up a few girls while he's at it.

There are 19 stages to be completed, each hosting their own secrets and colored keycards, not to be mention the alien nasties themselves. Some of the classic weaponry is in, the shrink ray and freezer for instance. And in, also, are some old villains too, like the all time fav Pig Cop.

Upto 4 GBA's can be linked together for the multiplayer deathmatch mode, but each player has to have his own gamepak.</desc>

    <name>Dynasty Warriors Advance </name>
    <desc>Dynasty Warriors Advance is a Game Boy Advance adaptation of the Dynasty Warriors franchise. Based on the "Three Kingdoms period" of ancient China,  it takes place at the end of the Han Dynasty during 190 A.D. As the previous government collapses, warlords rise up and fight among one another, eventually establishing three powerful kingdoms: Wei, Wu and Shu. Generals from each of these nations spend the next 100 years fighting among one another, each trying to become the dominant power.

Dynasty Warriors Advance is a top-down turn-based strategy board game, but with a focus on action combat. Since it is based on the earlier Dynasty Warriors titles, many of the same concepts carry over. Players begin by choosing one of three available characters from the lands of either Wu, Shu or Wei. Each character has their own unique storyline and missions. A briefing is given for each mission detailing specific objectives before allowing the player to equip themselves with weapons and skills at the camp. Once begun, the player moves the designed number of spaces (determined by movement) around the "board". If an enemy player is encountered, the game shifts to a top-down action fighting mode. Here the player uses one button to attack, another button to charge and another to unleash a misou special attack once it is powered up. Misou energy is charged by successful attacking enemy units. The player's success against the enemy unit will determine the unit's "heath" and will be destroyed completely if all of it's units are destroyed. Some enemy units contain not just soldiers but enemy generals who have their own special moves and greater health. Many missions feature specific objectives rather than just defeating all enemies.</desc>

    <name>Ecks vs Sever  </name>
    <desc>Ecks vs. Sever is the amongst the first FPSes to be featured on the Game Boy Advance. The game tells the story of Ecks, an ex-FBI Agent whose orders are to hunt down the beautiful assassin named Sever. As the cat-and-mouse-hunt progresses, both agents will find out that they are mere pawns in a larger government conspiracy...

In the Single Player mode, the player can choose wether he wants to play as Ecks or Sever. The choice makes a radical difference in the single-player campaign. As Ecks, your orders are to chase Sever, whilst as Sever, you have to evade him. The levels for both characters tend to be the same, but with different objectives, and different locations for both characters. 

As an example, the orders of Sever are to hunt down and kill a government agent whilst as Ecks, your orders are to prevent the assassination. During this level, both characters will encounter each other. As Ecks, you'll have to try and snipe Sever whilst evading her grenades. When you play this level as Sever, you'll have to throw grenades at Ecks, whilst avoiding his sniper fire.

The game also has a multi-player mode for up to 4 players with three different modes, which are Deathmatch (Every man for himself), Assassination (one player is the assassin who has to hunt down the VIP who's being protected by bodyguards) and Bomb kit (Try to gather all parts of a bomb before the other players do).</desc>

    <desc>Midway brings back all the craziness of the Cartoon Network's ED, EDD, N EDDY with ED, EDD, N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES for the Game Boy Advance. Centering around three kids with the same name, MIS-EDVENTURES follows Ed, Edd, and Eddy through yet another of their zany adventures. Gamers will control all three kids throughout the game, switching between them at any point. Each of the three had their own special abilities, and players will need to master each character to get through the puzzle-filled levels. Ed is the powerhouse of the team, able to pick up large objects and move them out of the way. Edd can operate machinery and can make use of different items. Eddy has stealth abilities and is the only character who can use stink bombs to get enemies out of the way. Each of the three also has an unique team-up move that involved all three characters working together. The levels contain the typical insanity often found in the cartoon. On one level, for example, players have to try to sell a number of snow cones from their snow cone stand; however, to get the business going, players have to steal ice from other characters. There are several different scams to complete, each of which involves Ed, Edd, and Eddy making use of whatever they can find or steal. Gamers who love ED, EDD, N EDDY will love stepping into the characters' shoes with ED EDD N EDDY: MIS-EDVENTURES.</desc>

    <name>Eragon </name>
    <desc>Eragon for the Game Boy Advance is a traditional turn based RPG with a combat system that emphasizes motion and action.  Players use combinations of spells, melee attacks, and ranged attacks to battle Urgals, thieves, soldiers, and other various enemies.  This is an RPG where combat strategy plays a key role in success.

Players can make use of the RPG mechanics to create offensive and defensive potions, craft better armor and weapons, learn offensive and defensive spells, or become trackers who are able to find hidden encounters.  This design encourages experimentation, opens up a lot of strategic possibilities, and allows a lot of replayability.

The player assumes the role of Eragon, a young boy with a mysterious origin and an important future, on his perilous journey to avenge his father, rescue the woman of his dreams and join forces with the Varden in their war against King Galbatorix. On this adventure Eragon encounters many allies; Brom the old wizened story teller, Ayra the elf guard of the dragon egg, Murtagh the orphan with a troubled past, Angela an herbalist witch, and a powerful dragon that will help unveil Eragon's true destiny.</desc>

    <desc>The player will control Timmy, who enters the world of his favorite comic book hero, the Crimson Chin. When Timmy discovers Chin has been kidnapped, the only person to save the day is Chin's sidekick, Cleft the Boy Chin Wonder, who just happens to be Timmy in costume. The player must release Chin from captivity by defeating enemies and overcoming obstacles along the way in this side-scrolling, action-packed videogame. Timmy's quirky Fairy Godparents, Cosmo and Wanda, appear throughout the 20 game stages to offer their own strange attempts at assistance. Cosmo and Wanda will supply Timmy/Cleft items to use in his journey -- some of which are key in defeating the captors. Throughout Fairly OddParents, gamers will move through several environments, including the Comic World, the Primitive Age, the Present World and the Future World.</desc>

    <desc>This game is a licensee of the 2005 movie "Fantastic 4". Unlike many licensed titles, this third-person action game in the vein of the Onimusha or Devil May Cry series only takes the base of its plot from the actual movie, then liberally changes it to make for better gameplay. Generally, the game brings in more content from the comic books than the movie, particularly considering the villains that appear. While the movie pretty much only concerned itself with Victor von Doom aka "Doctor Doom" as its supervillain of choice, the game brings in various characters from the comic books as well - the Mole Man, the Puppet Master, or Diablo, to name a few. The gameplay usually consists of walking the heroic title characters around a level and beating up the various enemies that cross their path. There are mission objectives, but usually the only way to achieve them leads through the enemies and just as usually the only way to fail them is to be overwhelmed by the Bad Guys. Beating up enemies yields points, which can be used to upgrade characters with new special moves or unlock various bonus materials. To spice it all up, developer Seven Studios have also thrown in a co-op mode that allows for playing the normal single-player mission in a tag team with a second player.</desc>

    <desc>Marche and a few friends are out on a usual venture through their local town, St. Ivalice, only to discover a book filled with fantasy and magic. Setting their mind to the thoughts of a magical land, they get transported to the world of Ivalice, which happens to be based on one of the friends' favourite games, Final Fantasy.

Finding himself alone, Marche must join a clan of warriors and travel through this new land of mystery to find his lost friends, and return to the real world, while learning all about this new place and the magic it holds.

Not a direct sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, FFTA combines the many elements of the tactical original with a slightly modern feel, and an original storyline for the GBA. As a clan leader, you must manage your team (from their combat skills and inventory to each and every battle you face).

Both your basic handheld weapons and magic are available to you, with the ability to summon monsters for support. Two players can link GBA's for battles, trading items and clan members as well.</desc>

    <name>Ford Racing 3 </name>
    <desc>The handheld versions of Ford Racing 3 allow players to race in a number of Ford-licensed cars, from classics (Model T) to new models (2005 Mustang GT), cars from movies, off-road tracks and even concepts vehicles such as the Mustang GT-R Concept.

From the main driver profile where all statistics are recorded, players can do a quick race of one of the three competitions: Ford Competition, Ford Challenge and Ford Collection. Most of the game's features need to be unlocked first. Next to the regular racing controls there is also a button used for boost. The different competitions offer ten racing types:

1. Standard: race for the first place.

2. Elimination: race five opponents over three laps. After the first and the second lap, the last two cars are knocked out and a duel ensues in the final lap.

3. Duel: a 3-lap race against six challengers in succession. After each won lap, a new one starts.

4. Drafting: stay in the opponent's slipstream to raise a power bar.

5. Driving Skills: race against the time and keep the timer going by passing through gates that award time bonuses.

6. Seconds Out: race against the time while collecting bonuses.

7. Time Attack: a straightforward timed race.

8. Boost: race with two boosts per lap.

9. Relay: transfer a baton three times around the track.

10. Overtake: overtake a number of vehicles before time runs out.</desc>

    <path>./Fortress (USA, Europe).zip</path>
    <name>Fortress </name>
    <desc>Fortress is a Tetris-variant puzzle game. As in that classic game, geometric pieces fall from the top of the screen and must be arranged in lines. Only instead of eliminating lines, the objective this time is to add them to the screen. The game starts with a timer (that counts a moment where neither player attack) and a castle gate falling between two flags (the opponent's flags can be seen to the left of the screen). Once placed, the remaining pieces are used to build a castle around it, as every 2x3 grid of pieces transforms into its walls. A grid of 8x3 pieces transforms into a wizard's tower that can summon a creature to attack the enemy castle. 

Certain special blocks add features to the building: a cannon block places a shooting cannon that starts to attack automatically the opponent's fortress. A block with a window adds one to the building. Repairing peons come out of it to help fix the damage to the castle's walls. A block with a bomb adds a cannon that fires a peon towards the opponent's castle (an aiming reticule is shown over the enemy castle to help choose the right spot). Building walls around these special blocks prevent their destruction from the enemy attack. A monster appears randomly at the bottom of the screen to attack both players.

The player's goal at each level is to reach a number of score points before the opponent. The pieces can be maneuvered with the digital pad, and pressing UP on it makes them fall fast downwards. They can be rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise with the A and B buttons, respectively. Holding the R trigger allows the player to move the screen with the digital pad (for a full view of battle scene). When pressed, the L trigger destroys the top 3 rows of your castle and decreases the score.

The game has three game modes: tournament, battle and blitz. They vary in the amount of seconds on the timer and the goal score. There are four themes: pre-historic, medieval, pirate and space.</desc>

    <desc>Paintball professional Greg Hasting's returns in Activision's GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for the Game Boy Advance, the sequel to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL. The second game in the series includes a number of paintball pros, different modes, and a level editor. Like the previous game, GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D includes a number of different gameplay modes. Players work as part of a team (either AI-controlled or with friends) to take down the opposing team in a number of different environments. The single-player campaign mode takes it a step further, putting players in charge of forming a paintball team from a number of unknowns and turning them into paintball champions. Along the way, players will face off against big-name paintball players, including Nicky Cuba, Matt Marshall, Peter Utsching, and, eventually, Greg Hasting himself. Between tournaments, players can purchase new equipment for their characters and spend accumulated skill points to increase their statistics. The biggest addition to MAX'D is the level editor. This allows gamers to create their own paintball arenas ranging from small to large, cluttered to open. Players can add bunkers, rocks, trees, picnic tables, and many other items to the field. Each map can be shared online or played with computer-controlled opponents. The ability to create and share custom levels online will keep players coming back to GREG HASTING'S TOURNAMENT PAINTBALL MAX'D for some time. It provides gamers with everything that makes paintball great without worrying about getting a ball of paint all over their faces.</desc>

The player has to find/examine evidences, press witnesses, and find the true murderers in order to prove the innocence of his defendant.

There are 5 cases in total. In some cases, the player does not control Ryuuichi, but rather some other characters for the courtroom battles. The story is also more intact than the previous games, and it also features a whole new cast of interesting characters.</desc>

    <name>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  </name>
    <desc>The game for Game Boy Advance based on the second Harry Potter book and movie is, like its predecessor, an action adventure, this time with an isometric perspective. 
 
In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, bad things are happening. The ancient Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and what lurks within is attacking students. To get through this ordeal alive (and advance the plot) Harry must again complete various challenges. These mostly consist of navigating large mazes - fighting monsters, solving puzzles, flipping switches and pressing buttons for doors to open. Six spells are available to help. As Harry is often in places he shouldn't be, stealth sequences are also a large part of the game. To avoid teachers and prefects, he can sneak around slowly and hide behind curtains. If he is caught, he is thrown out (to try again) and house points can be deducted. 
 
As in other Potter games, there are a lot of collectibles, found both in plain view and in hidden areas. Sets of Famous Wizard cards unlock bonuses, Every Flavour Beans get Harry passwords that let him move through shortcuts in the school and Chocolate Frogs increase his maximum stamina. 
 
Finally, Quidditch is also back in this game, this time in three-dimensional space, viewed from the back.</desc>

The Minister for Magic has decided to teach courses in defensive magic, but this leaves the young wizards woefully unprepared to defend themselves against the dark forces threatening them. Meeting secretly with a small group of students who name themselves "Dumbledore's Army", Harry has taken it upon himself to teach his band of students how to defend themselves against the Dark Arts, preparing the courageous young wizards for the extraordinary battle that lies ahead.</desc>

    <desc>The first Harry Potter game for the Game Boy Advance is an action adventure that lets you play as Harry in his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, following the story of the book and the movie.

You control Harry from an overhead view and must complete several tasks. These range from mundane class assignments like collecting ingredients for a potion to facing off against a giant troll. To master these challenges, Harry can learn five spells that allow him to push back opponents, flip switches, open doors, levitate objects and more. If Harry is hurt, he can find and eat Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans to regain health. By performing admirably in learning spells and completing missions, Harry can gain extra House Points so that Gryffindor might win the House Cup. If he misbehaves by attacking other students, or being caught wandering the halls at night, points will be deducted, however.
As seeker for the Gryffindor team, Harry must also compete in Quidditch matches. The game has a special mode for Quidditch and other events where Harry might have to mount his broom.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the animated cartoon by DIC (Super Mario Bros. Super Show, all three Sonic cartoons, The Real Ghostbusters) of the same name, Inspector Gadget Racing is a racing game developed by Bit Managers that is similar to games like the Mario Kart series, Vivid Image's Street Racer and other kart racing games for the SNES and Game Boy Advance. Selectable characters include Inspector Gadget (with both the Gadget Van and Gadget Mobile), Penny/Sophie (in a 4X4 truck), Brain (in an ice cream truck), Chief Quimby (in a police car), Dr. Claw, Agent Abdul (in a truck) and Agent Bruce.

The characters have their own power ups, for example Penny/Sophie has a shield, Gadget has his Gadget Mallet and Agent Bruce has an oil slick Spy Hunter-style. They can still pick up other power-ups, like missiles, bubblegum (to slow down an opponent), a shield and others. The game also has land-based courses, air-based courses and underwater-based courses

The game has multiple languages, like LSP's other Inspector Gadget game for the Game Boy Advance, Inspector Gadget: Advance Mission (English, Spanish, German, French, Italian and Dutch)</desc>

    <name>Island Xtreme Stunts  </name>
    <desc>Island Xtreme Stunts is a mixture of different genres in a single game. The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island. 
 
Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses.</desc>

    <desc>A long time ago, the mysterious "Ancients" created machines across the land that were able to harness the power of sound.  The Ancients disappeared, leaving only their devices for future civilizations to discover.  Years later, the "Settlers" arrived and built their cities in the lands where the machinery was left, and all was prosperous.

However, nothing remains perfect forever.  Powerful alchemists tried to harness the power of the Ancients' machines in their lust for power, and war broke out.  Those that tried to use the Ancients' machines, or The Dark Alchemists, as they became known, were killed or exiled, and peace eventually returned.  Rumour has it though, that the last of the Dark Alchemists, the Monophonic Menace, has returned to conquer the world.

Juka and the Monophonic Menace is an action-adventure game.  The title character, Juka, is an alchemist who can collect ingredients from trees, water, bushes, and other places to mix and create potions.  Potions can be used as a form of defense against enemies, can alter the landscape, or even activate machines.  Juka also has a "Sound Staff", which can be used to absorb and fire back different types of sounds at certain enemies.</desc>

    <desc>Clearly, the folks who built the original park were guilty of a few oversights. Think you can do any better? Try your hand at plotting out all of the details of the creation and management of a dinosaur park in JURASSIC PARK III: Park Builder. A strategy-simulation title of the highest caliber, the game leaves you in charge of 100 dinosaur species you have the task of placing them and maintaining their health. Of course, there's also the matter of the restaurants, shops, rides, and other attractions. If the park you create is too boring, poorly maintained, or excessively expensive, no one will show up, so you'd better use some seriously discerning judgment. In addition to managing the park, you'll have to pick up DNA strands from throughout the park to create new dinosaurs to keep the people coming back. Does it sound like too much to handle? Just wait until one of your prehistoric pals escapes on opening day.</desc>

    <desc>Karnaaj Rally is a handheld racing game which is played from a top down perspective and mixes 2D and 3D graphics. It's an arcade racer similar to Micro Machines where the player competes against three other racers on a number of different tracks. To his help, the player has a temporary turbo which he can refill by driving over special items that he finds on the race tracks. Weapons exist too; rockets and mines can be used by the player to stop the competition from winning. 

The game's career mode allows the player to compete and  progress in four different race series. Each of these has unique vehicles and courses. While racing the player can earn money which can be used to upgrade the car's tires and engine as well as buy more armor, rockets and mines. There's also a gambling option. The player can bet by guessing on different outcomes from the races, such as the right finishing order. 

The game also has a multiplayer mode for up to four players.</desc>

    <desc>Do you like to surf? Have you ever imagined surfing at different remote locations around the world? Well, Kelly Slater takes you around the world on his boat to surf some of the more famous beaches. With a control scheme similar to all the other Activision O2 brand games, it's easy to jump into the game and surf. 

PS2, XB, and GC description, further below is the GBA description.

Game Play Modes:
Infinite Time - With no clock, no objectives, and nobody around, this gives you the best opportunity to just enjoy the surf. 

High Score - With 3 minutes, how high of a score can you get?

Icon Challenge - See how many icons you can collect and how high of a score you can get before time runs out.

Career Mode - Select a surfer and journey around the world to surf the best waves on the best beaches. As you progress you will unlock new beaches, new surf boards, and new tricks which will be usable in all the other modes of play.

Multiplayer Modes:
Push - Two players surf simultaneously in an attempt to "push" the split screen towards their opponent's half of the screen. As you score points the screen gets pushed more. The winner is decided once one player is pushed from the screen.

Head to Head - Similar to Push but the screen is stationary and the winner is the person with the highest points when the time runs out.

Time Attack - Players take turns to achieve the most points possible. The more points you get the less time is alloted to your opponent.

The Pros in the game: Kelly Slater, Lisa Andersen, Tom Carroll, Tom Curren, Nathan Fletcher, Donavon Frankenreiter, Bruce Irons, Rob Machado, Kalani Robb, and some other secret characters.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Antarctica, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.

The PS2 version of the game also includes a playable demo of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4

GBA description

Surf Modes:
Championship - Compete against 8 other surfers. You progress by surfing in 12 stages, 3 heats per stage. Your surf score is tallied from each heat and the top 3 surfers of the stage get to move on.

Challenge - Pick a surfer and do challenges around the world.

Drop In - Instant action surfing - go and just surf.

Multiplayer - With a Link Cable and another copy of the game you and a friend can link up to compete against each other.

The Pros are the same as above.

The beaches in the game: Sebastian, Trestles, Mavericks, Waimea Bay, Jaws, Pipeline, Teahupoo, Bells, Curren's Point, Kirra, G-Land, J-Bay, Mundaka, Cortez Bank, and perhaps some other tucked-away hide-aways.</desc>

    <desc>Aiming and moving in cover and blind-fire modes is tricky, though. To gain the 3-D effect, some detail gets sacrificed. Usually this is no problem, but occasionally you'll have a tough time recognizing an object. You move from area to area to engage a new group of enemies. You'll conveniently find crates for cover and barrels to help you pull off big explosions. Locking the enemy in your crosshairs, signified by your crosshairs turning red, doesn't guarantee a direct hit? The accuracy depends on the weapon of choice. A shotgun will normally provide a kill on the first shot. If you have an automatic rifle, your shots are relatively inaccurate even if your aim is true.</desc>

    <desc>Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is an action/adventure video game developed by Ubisoft for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. In Europe, it is known as King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie. Due to the limited technology the Game Boy Advance has, King Kong: The 8th Wonder of the World is very different from the home console versions of the game. In this game, players switch between various roles - one being the movie exhibition visiting Skull Island to do filming which comprises actress Ann Darrow, director Carl Denham and scriptwriter Jack Driscoll, and the 25 ft gorilla and king of Skull Island, King Kong. While the overhead human section focuses on puzzle-solving and adventuring elements, Kong sections are combat-oriented side-scrollers.</desc>

    <name>Kururin Paradise </name>
    <desc>Kururin Paradise is the sequel to the GBA launch title, Kuru Kuru Kururin. In this game, Kururin and his family see an advertisement for the circus, which takes place at 6:00. Kururin's family arrive there on time, but Kururin is late, and when he gets there, everybody is missing! It's up to Kururin to search across the land for his missing family using his faithful helicopter, the Heririn. As in the first game, Kururin must navigate his way through fairly narrow mazes, trying not to hit the walls. Three consecutive hits, and the Heririn is destroyed, and you must start the stage again.

Paradise is vastly improved from the original game. It is now possible to find hidden keys in the levels, which open up locked doors, allowing for branched paths in the world map. Certain paths also lead to boss encounters, which take the form of an addictive mini-game including, but not limited to, lawn mowing, gathering stars, flying Kururin himself through clouds, and hopping across a path dodging helicopter blades. If you beat the boss, these mini-games are then added to your mini-game library, where you can play them against up to three friends using only one cart.

The game also features twelve toys built in that can be accessed by selecting one from a menu, then turning your GBA off, then on again. Most of them are fairly useless or incomprehensible in Japanese, but there are a couple of interesting ones, like the love tester, the musical note player, and the memory match game.</desc>

    <name>Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events </name>
    <desc>Based on the movie (and first three books of the series), Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events for Game Boy Advance puts players in the unfortunate shoes of the incredibly unlucky Baudelaire orphans: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny.

Each orphan has an unusual talent that will let them progress through three chapters (each with over a dozen levels). Though the game looks like a traditional side-scroller, combat takes a backseat to clever puzzle-solving and adventure game elements. The three orphans must use their talents, along with items found in the world, and various interactions to escape each level and avoid the evil Count Olaf and his elaborate plans to inherit the children's fortune.

Inventions also take a big role in this game, and players will have to assemble them from common household objects. For example, in one level, Violet will be hunting for ice cream scoopers, soup cans, and a crank to invent an "apple chucker" which can help defeat Count Olaf's friends.

The game offers quite a bit of replayability, too, with quest points and exotic books earned for discovering all the game's quirky secrets.</desc>

    <name>Lost Vikings, The </name>
    <desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

    <desc>The Penguins plot to escape from the zoo and, in the progress, rope other animal into their crazy plot. Like in the movie, the penguins want out of the New York zoo. As the game opens, the crack team of penguin escapees has put the finishing details on their escape plan, which involved digging a tunnel under the zoo and all the way to Antarctica. Of course, this isn't as easy as it sounds, and the penguins will need a number of supplies, items, and help. And along the way, they also intercept a group of four lost animals on their way to the island of Madagascar. Gamers take control of Private Penguin, who is assigned a number of missions to accomplish. He begins with a few standard attack and jumping moves, but as the game progresses, he will learn more powerful attacks and abilities like sliding. He will also find several useful gadgets to defeat enemies with. The four main characters from the movie show up at times, as well. While gamers of all ages will enjoy the crazy penguin antics, the difficulty of the game is aimed at younger gamers.

    <name>March of the Penguins </name>
    <desc>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.

Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.</desc>

    <name>Mario Party Advance </name>
    <desc>The first portable incarnation of the Mario Party series, Mario Party Advance shakes things up quite a bit on the GBA.  With the focus on the single-player, there are all kinds of single-player mini-games, one giant single-player board to traverse instead of multiple ones (Shroom City), and all kinds of different Gaddgets and gameplay modes to indulge in.

The main single-player experience involves traveling across "Shroom City," which is a major departure from the standard set-up in past Mario Party titles.  You have the choice to be Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi, and depending on who you choose, you'll start at a different spot on the board, which is quite large.

You're given die rolls to navigate the board and, when you reach special sections of the map, complete special quests, which often involve helping residents of Shroom City and/or participating in special challenges.  Most quests involve collecting some sort of object elsewhere or a mini-game.  By completing these quests, you'll collect stars, which eventually allow for special boss bouts with Bowser, and you'll unlock mini-games and Gaddgets, which are simple, toy-like contraptions that you can play with.

The game ends when you complete your allotted number of turns, although additional turns and die rolls can be earned during the game by completing the "Mushroom Challenges" that occur rather often.  After completing your session, your rewards are saved, and you can play with your mini-games and Gaddgets in Play Mode.

There are also two additional modes available, "Party Land," where you can play special duel mini-games with a friend, and "Challenge Land," where you play through special modes that test your mini-game skills to earn coins, which can be used to purchase additional unlockables in a shop.

Finally, there is also a feature called the "Bonus Board."  You can play with a board that is included with the game using the GBA.  The GBA takes care of die rolls, mini-games, and end-of-the-game events.</desc>

    <desc>The handheld version of Marvel Ultimate Alliance, like its console counterparts, has the player taking control over one of a selection of Marvel super-heroes and battling through locations and enemies from the Marvel universe. Selectable playable characters are: Spider-Man, Blade, Elektra, Thor, Wolverine, Captain America, Deadpool and Iceman. Ms. Marvel and Thing as also available as unlockable characters.

The game plays out something like Final Fight, where the player walks from left to right with the ability to move on the z-axis and punch and kick wave after wave of enemies including the occasional boss.

It has some unique elements added to the genre basics, however.  A meter controls the use of super powers, which can be upgraded as experience is gained. Players also have the ability to summon various Marvel heroes for quick support roles.  There are many items to find, both quest items, such as keys to unlock doors and weapons and equipment, like weapons and armor, to buff up the characters' abilties.</desc>

PS2/XB/NGC description

With the use of DVD technology, actual video footage of Mat and the crew was taken from their recent road trip and put into the game to give you a feeling of actually being there with them. Flatland tricks are another new addition. Also, there is the ability to tweak almost any stunt.

Single Player Modes:

Session - Take some extra time to practice your tricks and routines in 2, 5, or 10 minute sessions on any of the levels that are unlocked. Scores can be saved to be put into the Hall of Fame.

Free Ride - Like Session, you can use this time to practice your skills but with unlimited time. Any score you get for a trick is replaced by the points of the next trick. Since this is the case, no scores can be saved.

Road Trip - This is where you take the trip with the guys to go around and compete around the country. Withine each level there are goals to reach to improve your skills, unlock new levels, unlock bikes, and secrets in the game.

Multiplayer Modes:

Trick Attack - Compete against each other in a split screen competion to get the highest score you can in a certaon amount of time.

Tag - The person that is "it" is the only one that can score points. Be the first to find the red ring to be it. While you're it score as many points as you can. The person not it must track the other down and knock into them to be it. If the person that is it bails then the other person will become it.

H.O.R.S.E. - Just like the old game of HORSE for basketball. In this case you need to perform a higher scoring run to beat them for the letter. The one with the lower score with be given a letter. The first person to spell HORSE is the loser.

Treasure Hunt - Race against each other to find the Golden Condor. Getting the Condor is the only way to score points.

Half Pipe Hell - Up to 8 players can play HotSeat style. You must take turns tricking your way up a mountain of terraced half pipes. The only way to score is to climb to the top by transferring pipe to pipe.

Push - This is like Trick Attack, but as you score more and more points your opponent's screen will get smaller and smaller. The loser is the one that gets push all the way off the screen.

The Pros in the game include Mat Hoffman, Joe Kowalski, Rick Thorne, Mike Escamilla, Simon Tabron, Kevin Robinson, Cory Nastazio, Ruben Alcantara, Seth Kimbrough, and Nate Wessel.

The locations you get to go to are Oklahoma City, Chicago, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Boston, Los Angeles, Portland, and Hawaii.

    <desc>The ancient gods have passed judgment, and as a result all of mankind has been sentenced to be replaced with a new, less sinful race. The only chance for redemption lies withing a magical item that will allow mankind to atone for its sins. But the item in question has been stolen by the enemies of humanity, and the verdict of the gods will soon come to pass.

Mazes of Fate is a fantasy medieval first person "dungeon-crawler" RPG in which you create a character based on gender, class and attributes (or take your pick from one of the three pre-made characters) and set out in a quest to save the human race from oblivion. The game alternates between world and town map sequences in which you control your party from an overhead perspective and visit shops and get quests from NPCs and the many dungeons that compose the bulk of the game itself. While dungeon crawling the game switches to a first-person perspective from which you control your party as it fights all the monsters that cross your path and loot the treasures uncovered. Combat is real-time although the game pauses while you navigate action menus.

Features loads of items, weapons and quests, as well as tons of monsters and up to 5 recruit-able party members.</desc>

    <desc>Lan, Chaud, Dex and other characters from the Mega Man Battle Network Universe prepare to duke it out in the Battle Chip GP!  Take control of your favorite character and face off against many opponents as you make your way to the head of the GP to reach the ultimate prize, an incredibly rare battle chip!

Gameplay is based around the Mega Man Battle Network series of games, in that players purchase and use various battle chips to combat their opponents.  However, unlike the main games, players do not have direct control over their Net Navi.  Instead, players pre-select their battle chips, and one of these chips are used in the battle against the opponent.  Once selected, the game automatically plays out the battle.

There is also a process called 'slotting in', which can be performed by pressing L or R during battle when your slot in gauge is full.  Slotting in allows you to use an additional battle chip during gameplay to assist you.  If successful, the chip will be used, and aid you with healing, dealing extra damage, and so on.</desc>

    <desc>It is the year 22XX...

The legendary heroes of the Reploids, X and Zero, defeated the evil Sigma long ago, and a new army was created to prevent outbreaks of the Maverick Virus. But as time went on, the army became oppressive, and began to deal out a paranoid brand of justice. It is said that their leader, once a great warrior, has become cold and calculating, eliminating any Reploid that dares oppose him.

A hero is needed in these dark times, and that is exactly what Ciel and her rebel group have found in an old ruin...a hero from the past, reborn in the future.

Zero has come into a time he does not know, to save it from a figure of the past...the fate of freedom rests on his shoulders.</desc>

To fix the problem, Zero must battle through level after level, using the new Chain Rod weapon to grapple onto ledges to gain an advantage in collecting out of reach items or attacking enemies from above. Cyber Elfs can again be collected to gain some helpful powerups.

New to the series is a two player challenge mode, where the first to complete the level wins.</desc>

    <desc>In the third installment of Capcom's Mega Man Zero series, you, unsurprisingly, play as Zero. Continuing where the Mega Man Zero 2 left off, you have to find and neutralize the recently escaped "Dark Elf," before it's able to brainwash the Resistance for the purpose of conquering Neo Arcadia. 

In addition to the old Cyber Elf system, this game also contains a new "chip" system, where Zero can gain new abilities by finding chips and installing chip in himself. But they didn't decide to abandon the Cyber Elves in this game by giving them nothing new. No, in order to extend the life of the Cyber Elves, they added the new concept of "Cyber Space" to levels, where you enter a door to Cyber Space and are allowed to use each Cyber Elf as much as you please without them dying. However, there aren't too many "Secret Disks" (items that can contain anything from profiles of characters to Cyber Elves to new chips) in Cyber Space, so it's better to spend more time in the normal level.</desc>

    <desc>Metal Slug: Super Vehicle-001 is a run and gun video game for the Neo-Geo console/arcade platform created by SNK. It was released in 1996 for the MVS arcade platform. The game is widely known for its sense of humor, extremely fluid hand-drawn animation, and fast-paced two-player action. It is the first title in the Metal Slug series. There were plans to port Metal Slug to the Game Boy Advance (it was mentioned in the development section), however, as the official SNK website stated, "Due to the limited memory size of the GBA cartridge the plans for MS on GBA has been cancelled."</desc>

Monster House is an action-adventure game developed by Artificial Mind and Movement and published by THQ. The game is based on the film of the same name. 
 
Although the game was marketed toward the same pre-teen audience as the accompanying film, its gameplay was highly reminiscent of Resident Evil 4; the game was generally higher-quality than many other games based on children's films, and it received high ratings from numerous prominent gaming magazines and websites, including Play magazine and GameZone. 
 
Monster House was met with mixed reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the Game Boy Advance version 66.50% and 69/100, the GameCube version 65.13% and 60/100,  the DS version 63.65% and 62/100 and the PlayStation 2 version 60.64% and 59/100.</desc>

    <name>Monster Rancher Advance </name>
    <desc>Monster Rancher Advance is a monster raising sim that allows players to raise and customize 440 monster types. These monsters can then be tested in in-game tournaments, or battled against other players in 2P mode with the GBA link cable. 

Monsters are created in the game's shrine through the entry of letters, numbers and punctuation symbols. Players begin with the ability to enter up to 4 characters to make monsters, and can unlock the ability to use up to 8 characters through gaining higher trainer ranks. Different words or combinations of characters can not only make different types of monsters, but each monster can have varying attributes and characteristics, making each one unique.

Players then train the monsters by choosing  which foods to feed, which drills to do to raise attributes, what training to send them to for new attacks, and what items to give them. The game starts with a modest amount of money with which food and items can be purchased, more money is earned in tournaments. Gameplay revolves around planning training sessions, adding new attacks and juggling a bank account, along with attempting to win tournaments. As monsters age, they can be added to a coaching staff to help raise new monsters to better attributes, or they can be combined with other monsters to make stronger babies. Monsters do not die in this game, however, they do face an enforced retirement age.

There is a fairly straightforward storyline, where some characters from older Monster Rancher games visit, and new characters are introduced. The gameplay itself, like most other Monster Rancher games, is open-ended and has unlimited replay value.

The 2 Player mode, involving a link cable and two copies of the game, allows players to test the monsters they have raised against other players. The 2P mode also allows players to trade items and cash with one another, to wager items or cash on tournaments, and trade raised monsters into each others' games.</desc>

    <path>./Monster! Bass Fishing (USA).zip</path>
    <name>Monster! Bass Fishing </name>
    <desc>Although the name implies you're going to catch monsters, Monster! Bass Fishing is a normal fishing game where you can catch a variety of fish including various bass, northern pike, catfish, and more.  The "monster" part is that you get bonus points for catching monster-sized fish.

The game is played in one of two modes, Challenge or Free Fish.  In Free Fish, you can fish in any location that is unlocked for as long as you like.  In Challenge, you are competing in a tournament and will have a time limit and a specific location to fish at.

When you start at a location in either mode, you have the option to move your boat to any place on the map.  However, this does take time and may not always be in your best interest in the Challenge mode.  You can then either start casting, or you can change your lure first.

Catching fish is really just a matter of using a good lure and tempting movements.  When a fish strikes, you need to keep enough pressure on the line to keep the hook set, or the fish will get away.  If you let the line get too tight, the line will break and you'll lose the fish then as well.  Now just reel it in and see what you caught.

The GUI shows a nice fish finder that is color-coded by the type of fish that is seen.  Note that this finder is not always accurate.

Statistics for the game are very nice.  You can see a nice picture of your fish that you catch along with the size of it.  The top 6 can then be saved in the Aquarium for viewing at any time.  Your tournament scores will be based on weight of fish and any monster bonuses (bonuses for catching one of the top 3 largest fish that round).  Winning the tournaments will unlock new locations and let you progress to a new location for the next tournament.  It will also get you a nice trophy.</desc>

    <name>Moorhen 3 - The Chicken Chase!  </name>
    <desc>This really couldn't be any simpler; Moorhen features no complicated gameplay whatsoever. You just shoot things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not. 
 
One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50.</desc>

    <desc>The Nowhere Islands are an idyllic place; the residents of Tazmily Village live peacefully and in harmony with nature and with each other. But this changes when the mysterious Pigmask Army arrives and proceeds to destroy and corrupt, with force and sly persuasion alike. The main character is Lucas, a young boy who must find out who wants to destroy the tranquility of Nowhere Islands and turn them into a high-tech nightmare. 

Mother 3 is a top-down role-playing game. The player character (the characters controlled by the player change often) travels around the Nowhere Islands with his party, talking to people and furthering the plot. It is possible to "dash", which not only allows to travel faster, but also allows to knock weaker enemies out of the way (or to ram some objects/characters). 

There are many enemies to battle in the game. The battles are turn-based; each turn, a character can attack with his weapon, use a special ability (some characters have powerful psychic abilities, others have different special skills), use an item or try to run away. The battles feature a musical combo system, where tapping a button in rhythm with the background music will cause additional damage to the enemy. The characters have "rolling HP meters"; when they are dealt damage, they don't lose all the HP right away, but their HP decreases slowly; this way, even if a character receives massive damage, he can survive with only minor injuries if you manage to end the combat quickly. Winning battles gives the characters experience (and thus makes them stronger) and, later in the game, money (known as "DP"), which can be used in shops to buy better equipment or useful objects. 

There are many frogs encountered throughout the game, who serve as save points (and later as ATM machines). If all characters die during a battle, you can come back to life near the latest save point encountered and try again.</desc>

    <path>./Motocross Challenge (USA) (Proto).zip</path>
    <name>Motocross Challenge  </name>
    <desc>Motocross Challenge is a 2D side-scrolling motorcycle game combining regular racing and tricks. The game can only be played through an emulator or a GBA flashcard but is not strictly homebrew. It is a game made by a commercial developer, but when the project was cancelled by two publishers, they decided to release the game for free. The game can also be ordered on a cartridge from the developer's website. In 2010 it was followed up with an iPhone/iPad release.

The tracks remind of Excitebike while the gameplay seems inspired by Motocross Maniacs. The game offers two main modes: Free Ride (choose an unlocked bike and track to practise) and Challenge. The Challenge mode involves a series of events in 3 major categories: Beat the Clock (time-based), Trick Attack (points-based) and World Tour (race against 3 AI opponents). When all courses are finished, the final event, MXC Championship, is unlocked. The events are divided over different trees and completing certain courses unlocks new tracks or one of the 8 available bikes. The bikes have different statistics based on speed, handling, acceleration, height, boost and suspension.

Gameplay involves a fair amount of physics. When the bike accelerates, the front wheel leaves the ground and this needs to be compensated by nudging the d-pad. Up and down on the d-pad is used to switch lanes. Many tricks (activated through the L-button) involve balance and constant correcting is needed. Next to accelerating, braking and tricks, there is a button for boost. Only a limited amount is offered, but it constantly regenerates at a slow rate. It is used to gain extra speed, especially before big jumps to gain extra air time. The full amount of boost should never be used or let maxed out, as too little or too much slows the bike down. While in the air, using a combination of the L-button and the d-pad, players can perform tricks such as superman, nac-nac of backflip. By completing Trick Attack events, new tricks can be unlocked.

There are different types of tracks, set on a beach, an arena, downtown, in the snow, in a forest, in a desert and even a dump. They contain a series of jumps but also areas that slow down the bike, along with obstacles. The game screen shows the current position of the player (in World Tour), the current location on the track along with the finish, the time (remaining time in Beat the Clock), the current lap (in World Tour), the boost meter and the amount of points for a trick, and the remaining trick points needed (in Trick Attack). The game supports passwords to save and restore the player's progress.</desc>

    <desc>The player controls a motorcyclist and must try to win races on various terrain and settings. Each motorcycle in the game handles differently with some performing better on paved roads and others working better on rougher terrain.[1]

There are a number of different modes: Grand Prix (GP), Motocross, and Traffic. GP takes place at a number of different locations across the world on paved tracks in places such as San Francisco and Russia. The paved tracks require the player to learn how to effectively use their brakes around corners. The GP courses contain small differences between them, giving more variety to the courses in the game. Motocross requires the player to drive on off-road terrain and to master the act of "powersliding" on corners. The courses found in Motocross races are less hospitable and often take place in arid and unkept locales and with obstacles. Traffic mixes both GP and Motocross, having mixed pavement courses and traffic on roads that serve as obstacles.</desc>

    <desc>MX 2002 featuring Ricky Carmichael is a motocross game which features two basic modes of play. One of motocross racing in which players have the standard practice/single race/season options with ongoing success unlocking more tracks and bikes. The other mode is a stunt-based motocross practice/competition mode where riders try to do as many crazy tricks in a crowd filled arena as possible within a particular amount of time. The game has a unique feature in that the bike has a controllable clutch (even for automatic gears) which must be mastered to succeed at the game. Correct use of the clutch when landing jumps of traversing troublesome terrain allows the rider's speed to be kept at a maximum. This must be used in conjunction with the "Prime Jump" button which must be held before a jump or bump to fly through the air.</desc>

    <name>Onimusha Tactics </name>
    <desc>Young warrior, Onimaru is given the Oni Gauntlet as he rushes to defend his village from the demon hordes of Nobunaga Oda. Onimaru soon discovers from the old man Sandayu, that although he has been living in the peaceful province of Iga, he is of the Oni clan and had been secreted away. Additionally, with the power of the Oni Gauntlet, he can absorb the souls of enemies and use the demon Genma stones to recreate lost weapons and armor. With this new knowledge of who his is and of his destiny, he assembles a hasty squad of fighters including his sister Ororo and sets off to avenge his province and stop Nobunaga's demonic war upon the land.

Onimusha Tactics is a turn-based strategy game between the player's side and the enemy's side. In each level you can bring a squad of no more than 10 people. There are no items to buy or sell, however equipment is available and customizable. Upgrades of existing weapons and armor can be done using the defeated souls of enemies absorbed into the Oni Gauntlet. New weapons and armor can be found or created through fusion of Genma Stones. Recipes must be found for each separate item before it can be fused.

Most characters have a normal attack, the ability to use items and several special techniques for battle. Additionally there is an issen ability that randomly shows up and allows your character to counter-attack and instantly kill any enemy who foolishly attacks that character directly in the next round.</desc>

    <name>Open Season  </name>
    <desc>Open Season for GBA is based on the movie and it is a completely different game experience than the console version. The story in the game follows the movie pretty well and it is well presented through in-game and comic dialog style cinematics. It's about a Grizzly bear named Boog who is very happy with his domesticated home. But one day he gets in trouble with his new friend Elliot and the town's authority decides to put them back in the woods where they belong. Unfortunately, for them, the hunting season has just begun and Boog has no idea how to survive outside of his garage home with his beloved caretaker, Beth. 

The game begins just before Boog and Elliot are dropped in the woods. You control Boog and he has many cool moves. He can jump, roll, grab and throw forest animals as well as roar. The goal of the game is to protect the forest animals from the hunters. The forest is full of hunters and boss hunters in each animal territory. It is your job to clean up the forest so play it wild and rally an army of forest critters in a hilarious quest to scare off the hunters!</desc>

    <name>Oriental Blue - Ao no Tengai  </name>
    <desc>The game continues the tradition of Tengai Makyou series, also known as "Far East of Eden". You play as either Tenran or Aoi, a teenage boy and girl, respectively, on quest to defeat the ancient evil that threatens the prosperous land of Jipang, to prove themselves worthy of the legendary Fire Clan, warriors who have been protecting Jipang for many generations from evil demons and warlocks. The land Jipang is very similar to medieval Japan, and during your adventure you'll also visit Mongolia, China, and other Asian countries. 
 
The most important new feature of the game is a non-linear storyline. You can tackle many missions in any order you want, and the storyline also changes depending on the outcome of major battles. If you lose against a boss enemy, the game is not over, but instead, a branching storyline path is revealed. Otherwise, the gameplay is similar to other Tengai Makyou games, featuring overworld map traveling and first person perspective, turn-based combat.</desc>

    <desc>Four classic Pac-Man games are included in this collection from Namco:

1. Pac-Man: The original arcade classic, complete and un-cut. 
2. Pac-Mania: A conversion of the 1987 update to Pac-Man, which takes the elements of the original arcade game and puts it into an isometric view, as well as adding the ability to jump.
3. Pac-Man Arrangement: Never re-produced outside of the arcade, Arrangement again uses the elements of the original Pac-Man and adds a fifth ghost, who can change shape and size when combined with the other 4 ghosts, and make life harder for Pac-Man. New power-ups are also included, like the ability to dash quickly around the screen, warp points to get from one place to the other and new ways of catching ghosts.
Pac-Attack: Like Tetris before it, you must fit falling blocks together to complete a line to clear the screen. In this case, the falling tiles also have ghosts in them, and once the Pac-Man tile appears (a tile with the Pac-Man symbol), Pac-Man will eat all of the ghosts that are in his path until he gets to a dead end.</desc>

He still faces opposition, however, from ghostly nemeses like Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde. He must also run, jump, and swim his way past other malevolent creatures, such as skeletons, spiders, and killer fish. Thankfully, Pac-Man has a variety of attack methods. Excluding ghosts, most baddies are susceptible to projectile "Pac-Dots," the "Ultra Butt-Bounce" (which also helps him jump higher), or the "Rev Roll," a speed burst allowing Pac-Man to make lengthy jumps off ramps. When disposing of ghosts though, he must first ingest a good old-fashioned Power Pellet, then devour them before its effects wear off.</desc>

In response to this, the great Wizard Pac created a potion that turned 5 ordinary fruit into the "Golden Fruit." A young knight called Sir Pac-alot fought and sealed Spooky underneath a large tree using the Golden Fruit, which were attached to the branches of the tree. In the present time late at night, Inky, Pinky, Blinky and Clyde sneak into the village and, in their mischief, pick the Golden Fruit off the tree in the center of town. Unfortunately, this has released Spooky from his prison. Spooky tells the ghosts to take the Golden Fruit and follow him if they wish to rid the land of the Pac-people forever. When Pac-Man awakes, he hears the news from Professor Pac about the Golden Fruit and Spooky, and sets off to defeat the ghosts and Spooky.</desc>

    <desc>Pinobee: Wings of Adventure takes full advantage of Game Boy Advance's 32-bit color graphics. From Pinobee's fluid animation to the detailed environments he explores, it's obvious that a lot of spit and polish has been applied to this Pak. Pinobee screenshots may lead you to believe that this is a standard action platform game, but that is far from an accurate description. Pinobee can walk along the ground or shimmy up walls, but his main means of locomotion is dashing through the air. As he makes it deeper in his quest, Pinobee gains the ability to dash farther and farther through the air. Soon enough, he's spending more time hovering and dashing through the sky than on the ground. This unique play control system gives Pinobee a fresh feel.</desc>

    <name>Polarium Advance </name>
    <desc>Polarium Advance is basically the same as Polarium for the Nintendo DS, but a couple of new blocks have been added.

This is a puzzle game in which the player must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white). To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select the blocks in one line. In most puzzles, you can use the border to lengthen the line. The new blocks in the Advance version are: Hurdle Tiles, which you cannot pass, Multi-Tiles, which count as black or white, and Solid Tiles, which will not turn but are removed so that the tiles above them fall down. There are 365 puzzles in this mode (Daily Polarium) ranging from very easy to quite challenging.

The Time Attack Mode requires you to solve either ten easy puzzles or five hard puzzles within the time given. Leaving a block of the wrong color in a line results in a 30 seconds penalty. 

It is possible to create your own puzzles and share them with friends. Puzzles created in the Nintendo DS version of the game are compatible with the GBA version.</desc>

    <name>Puyo Pop Fever  </name>
    <desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

    <name>Qwak   </name>
    <desc>In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.</desc>

    <name>Racing Gears Advance </name>
    <desc>This handheld racing game offers a range of licensed cars, several courses and circuits, and a challenging set of opponents. To these stock elements, it adds one more: weaponry. Now you can choose to nitro past the opponent ahead of you, or slow him down with a missile.

With each vehicle and driver pair you can race in Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with tracks or choose a Championship Mode to progress through a series of circuits. After each race you'll need to spend some of the money you've earned (either by placing or picking up money icons during the race) to repair and -- if possible -- upgrade your car. The upgrades can improve your car as a racing machine (e.g. a larger engine or better brakes) or as a war machine (e.g. adding more weapons bays or buying a new type of weapon).

The track design uses the isometric view, and almost never puts the car behind an obstacle. However, among the twisty roads are a few shortcuts that require you to think outside the lines of the road, and occasionally take a leap of faith.</desc>

    <desc>Reign of Fire will throw gamers into ferocious battles between two ancient species fighting for survival: humans and dragons. An action-packed third-person arcade adventure set in the near future, players will choose to take the side of either the humans - struggling to fight back against their seemingly insurmountable foes - or the dragons themselves: an awesome army of fire-breathing beasts intent on incinerating everything in their path.

The dragons have remained illusive until today, despite the fact they are the stars of Reign of Fire. Players will encounter several breeds of the deadly beasts throughout the game, either on the receiving end of their awesomely destructive powers or even better still, in the firing seat themselves.</desc>

    <desc>Rhythm Tengoku is a music game based around good timing and rhythm.  The game has music supplied by the record production company J.P. ROOM, and is developed by the team responsible for Wario Ware.  This is visible in the quirky presentation of the game.

As with Wario Ware, the game is actually a series of shorter games bundled into one package.  Before each game starts, you are presented with a short tutorial that gets you ready and practice before you begin the real thing.  Control is normally very simple - usually, only the A Button is required, but some games make players press multiple buttons for different actions.

Players will punch in time with a karate expert as pots and rocks are thrown; pluck hairs off of an onion; march in time to an instructor; hit a baseball while the screen zooms in and out; shoot ghosts with arrows; chop demons as a samurai; and much more.  At the end of each set of stages is a 'remix stage' - in this stage, sections of the previously played stages are combined and thrown at you at random, all while a single song plays.</desc>

    <name>Robots </name>
    <desc>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.

Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.

The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</desc>

    <desc>Over the years, toy fads come and go, but the truly great toys are always popular. This is true of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS, a game that pits a blue robot against a red robot in a boxing match. DSI Games and Full Fat, recognizing the popularity of the toy, has created a Game Boy Advance version of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS so players no longer need to have their punching robot handy to go a few rounds. The core concept of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS transfers over to the GBA with no problem. Players select which of the robots they want to control and get into the ring, punching and blocking their way to victory. Gamers can practice, play a quick fight, or enter a tournament to see if they can claim the title of Rock â€˜em Sock â€˜em master. The game also features a two player mode using the Game Boy Advance Link, giving players the chance to battle their friends in much the same way they would play with the toy. This is the real joy of ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS because playing against a friend really captures the feel of the classic robot battling game. Players who enjoy playing with the robot boxing toys will love ROCK â€˜EM SOCK â€˜EM ROBOTS.

    <desc>Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation is a semi-sequel to the previous games, Mega Man Battle Network 4 Red Sun and Blue Moon.  In this game, the player does not control Lan – instead, you play as yourself.  Upon the game's first play, you are prompted to enter details such as date, time, your age and occupation.  You can then choose your Net Navi (initially available for selection are Mega Man, Roll, GutsMan and NumberMan).

Unlike previous Battle Network games, you do not directly control your Net Navi.  Instead, you can tell your Navi which enemy they should attack, as well as their attacking distance, and they will perform according to your directions.  You can also select to use  Battle Chips (from three which are randomly selected from your folder) by using the Control Pad to select the chip described at the bottom of the screen, then pressing A to use it.

The game also supports a peripheral created specifically for the game, called the Battle Chip Gate. This peripheral plugs into your Game Boy Advance, and allows the player to send their Navi Battle Chips during battle, much like Lan does in the Mega Man NT Warrior anime.  You can get additional Battle Chips when you purchase assorted Mega Man Battle Network toys, such as character figures.</desc>

    <name>R-Type III - The Third Lightning </name>
    <desc>R-Type III was originally released only on the Super Famicom/SNES, but later ported to the Game Boy Advance. It was the first game in the series to introduce new Forces. As well as the original Force (which was now named the Round Force, later named as the Standard Force in R-Type Delta), the player could choose from two other Forces: the Shadow Force and the Cyclone Force. These both had new, different weapon sets and special enhancements. 
 
It also refined the weapons and charging system. It reverted to the original Red-Blue-Yellow weapon system, and the Diffusion Wave Cannon from R-Type II was replaced with a more standard wave cannon. Charging this cannon to full beam strength results in a massive, powerful beam that passes through all enemies and obstacles. A new weapon called the Hyper Wave Cannon was also added to the ship, which the player could use instead of the normal wave cannon if desired. By switching to Hyper mode and supercharging the wave cannon, the ship temporarily gains the ability to use the Hyper Wave Cannon, which is unique among wave cannons in having a rapid fire capability. The shots fired create damaging explosions, and if the player has collected one or two Bits, they spin around the ship burning with energy. However, this Hyper mode causes the ship to overheat after a short while, and it must subsequently spend seconds cooling down, during which time the wave cannon is inoperative. 
 
The fighter in R-Type III is identified in R-Type Final as the R-9Ø Ragnarök; it was originally referred to as 'R-90'. In fact, the original R-90 has been split into three in Final: the R-9S Strike Bomber has the R-90's basic Standard force unit and first wave cannon, identified as Mega Wave Cannon. Final's version of the R-90 has the Shadow Force and Hyper Wave Cannon, but is unable to choose its Force or switch between Wave Cannons. Finally, the R-9Ø2 Ragnarok II has the R-90's final Force, the Cyclone Force, and the Giga Wave Cannon, which can be charged through 7 loops. It can be assumed that this is because the original R-90 would simply be too powerful for the game to be any kind of challenge.</desc>

    <path>./Shining Force - Resurrection of the Dark Dragon (USA).zip</path>
    <name>Shining Force - Resurrection of the Dark Dragon </name>
    <desc>Shining Force is a turn-based tactical RPG. Battles take place in square grids, and each unit occupies one square. Each unit can move up to a fixed amount of squares along the battlefield, determined by its Move statistic. Depending on its location relative to enemies and to allies, a unit can also perform one action: attack, cast a spell, use an item, or search the area. Some commands, such as equipping or dropping items, don't count as actions. The order of turns is determined by the unit's agility score and a random seed. 
 
In Shining Force, each allied unit is represented by a character with his or her own background and personality, much like in the Fire Emblem series. Although there are no "generic" units, except on the enemy side, most characters contribute little or nothing to the plot upon joining the player army. 
 
Each allied unit also has a class, which defines a set of abilities for that unit and determines the spells and equipment they have access to. A unit can be promoted to another class at any level between 10 or 20. Upon promotion the character's level resets to 1 and statistics are reduced by a fixed amount, although they begin higher if the character had been promoted at a higher level. 
 
Battle goals for the player are fairly simple: kill all enemies, kill the enemies' leader, or advance to a town or landmark. The enemy side wins if they kill the player's leader, Max, or if the player chooses to escape the battle by casting Egress. Even if the player army is defeated, the player can recover allies and retry the battle. The Force keeps any experience that is obtained, regardless of the battle's outcome. Thus, there is no Game Over, and the player's army gets stronger even upon its defeat, although Max's death results in the player losing half of their money.</desc>

    <name>Shining Soul II </name>
    <desc>The Dark Dragon was defeated by our hero in the first Shining Soul, and the people rejoiced as the Darkness faded away.  People are quick to forget, however.  As time passed, people's lives improved and they forgot about the Darkness.  But as the Light grew more and more powerful, it upset the balance between Light and Dark and soon Darkness was on the rise once again.

A prophet comes and warns the people of the impending dangers, but no one listens to him.  Although his crystal shows the upcoming dangers, the people pass by without any interest.  An agent of the Darkness, Gillespie, lures this prophet outside the city and kills him and shatters his crystal so the people remain ignorant of what is coming.

This same agent gives the "Forbidden Fruit" to Deatharte, the trusted adviser to King Marcel in Klantol Castle.  The adviser didn't trust Gillespie, but curiosity is a powerful force.

It is now up to another hero to take on the journey to once again stop this growing Darkness.  After choosing your character from 8 possible, you start out on his or her way to a tournament being held at Klantol castle.  On your way, you meet an adventurer who will explain how to battle.  Your journey then takes you to the castle to start the tournament.

This tournament is interrupted when the king finds out his daughter is missing.  The king's adviser heads out to find her, and the king asks that you go as well.  It is here that your story really begins.

The gameplay is similar to most RPGs of this type where the monsters are fought in real-time.  An interesting part of this game is that your resistances will increase when used.  Outside the castle, you can stand on a fire that will not damage your HP, but as your resistance reacts to the fire, it will increase slowly.  Traps will also increase your resistance if you are hit by them, though you will also be hurt.  Only the one fire is safe.

Take on many monsters, cast spells, get new equipment.  But most of all, save the world from Darkness.</desc>

Now players can battle their way through the story mode or fight a friend using the GBA link. SHREK SUPERSLAM features 10 characters from SHREK and SHREK II, including Shrek, Donkey, Fiona, Puss-n-Boots, the Gingerbread man, and more.

Each character has a basic light and heavy attack plus throws and a unique slam attack that they can use once they build up enough power by hitting their foes. Each character also has specific strengths and weaknesses that will impact how players battle with them. Players can also grab weapons that appear on each level and use them against their opponents. There are a number of different modes in the game, including the single-player story mode, tutorial mode, multiplayer mode, and the mega challenge mode.

Later on, players acquire new characters, like swashbuckling Puss In Boots who can cling to walls and grind down banisters, as well as plenty of other characters from the movie. Learn the attributes of each character's personality, attacks and abilities to progress through an action-packed quest.

    <desc>In the Game Boy Advance version of Shrek the Third, you must complete levels playing as a combination of Shrek, Prince Artie, Puss in Boots, and Donkey. The levels are mostly puzzles, where you can only access certain areas with a certain character, so all playable characters must work together to all reach the end. Each character has special abilities, such as Shrek's ground pound to break through pits in the ground.

You will encounter many different AI types throughout gameplay, including evil witches, arrow-shooting guys, gnomes, etc. There are collectible faeries in each level that you must collect enough of to progress to the next world. 

This is a simple platformer-puzzle game that is mostly geared towards children, seeing as there are no lives, and relatively simple combat, but it should also appeal to adults who enjoy the Shrek franchise.</desc>

As players explore the overworld, they can also discover Gun Data, which can be used to customize the player's shot with over 15,000 different weapon combinations using abilities such as rapid fire, vertical shot, and experience gain.</desc>

    <name>Snood </name>
    <desc>Snood is a puzzle game based on a simple idea, of the kind that was commonplace in the late 1980s. The game is set out with a grid of small differently-coloured shapes, each featuring faces drawn on them. A succession of blocks are placed in an aiming device at the bottom of the screen, and you must rotate this so as to aim them, off the walls if necessary, to hit ones of the same colour.

When 3 or more of the same colour make contact, they are removed from the field of play. Any blocks which were only connected to those blocks (and not to any others or the ceiling) get removed from play as well. This is crucial, because each shot that fails to drop any blocks off causes a meter to move on one level. When this reaches the top, the line of blocks drops by one level. Once it reaches the point where blocks are moved down below the playing area, it is Game Over.

There are five skill levels, as well as a set of 50 challenge levels, and a Journey mode in which you play through one level from each difficulty. From medium difficulty upwards, you'll have to contend with Skulls among the layout - these can only be removed by being dropped away.</desc>

Circular snood will also get you in a spin! Fire the snoods up to the highest levels, but watch out -- there are no straight sides to bounce off! You are in a circular tube and the snoods will bounce and fly everywhere if your angles are wrong.

    <desc>Sonic the Hedgehog has arrived for his first ever adventure on a Nintendo console. Sonic Advance combines elements from the original Sonic series on Sega's Genesis, as well as from the Dreamcast Sonic Adventure series.

Choose from Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, or Amy and take them through level after level of blindingly fast gameplay and ring collecting, dodging enemies in your path towards the final showdown with Dr Robotnik (aka Dr Eggman). 

Collect Chaos Emeralds along the way to transform into Super Sonic for added speed, and train your Chao to exchange them into Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the Nintendo Gamecube.

And if that wasn't enough, you can also play 4 player battle modes with your mates, using one game cart between 4 GBA's.</desc>

Once again, Sonic is called upon to save the world from the evil Dr. Eggman. On this occasion, Sonic is joined by friends Tails, Knuckles and Cream and rabbit, the latest addition to the Sonic team. Each comes with a set of unique moves, allowing you to reach certain areas through-out the levels. However, unlike Sonic Advance, you must compelte the game as Sonic to unlock the other characters.

Chaos Emeralds and Special Rings litter the stages. To collect the emeralds (transforming Sonic into Super Sonic for the final battle with Dr. Eggman), you must find the special rings hidden in each stage to unlock the bonus stage. Complete the bonus stage and the emerald is yours.

You'll also get the chance to collect and raise chaos, and trade them over to Sonic Adventure 2: Battle on Gamecube, through the use of the GBA/GC link cable.</desc>

    <desc>Sonic Battle is a fast paced pseudo-fighting game akin to Super Smash Bros. Rather than being 3D side-scrolling, the game employs a 3D isometric view that is comprised of actual texture-mapped polygons. The character sprites are 2D.nnnnThere are 9 characters to choose from and 5 modes of play: Story, Battle, Challenge, Training, and Mini Games. You can link up 4 GBA's to fight your friends, and each character has several different attacks. It has a system of selecting Aerial, Ground, and Guard based attacks. Depending on what type of attack you set for which area (aerial/ground/guard) you have a possibility of 9 total different special attacks to choose from (only 3 at a time in a match though) which you can change each time you lose 1 stock point.nnnnThe game includes a trainable character whose abilities and techniques you can raise and add to. You get to pick and choose every aspect of the robot's style (running, attacking, jumping, dashing, etc.).nnnnThe game takes a moderate amount of time to play through as all the characters, and adds a longer lifespan to itself if you wish to play through and beat it completely (all characters, get all moves for the trainable robot, etc).</desc>

    <name>Space Invaders </name>
    <desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

The Green Goblin is the main villian here, and as Peter Parker you must defy gravity using your spider crawl, web-slinging and spider-sense abilities to track down Spidey's nemesis through the skyscapers of New York City. 
 
The major inclusion for this title over the previous Spider-Man series (on Playstation also by Activision) is aerial combat. Attack the enemy mid-air while web-slinging, rise and decend while swinging and banking around buildings create a greater emphasis on Spidey's greatest asset, the spider web.</desc>

    <desc>One of history's best-loved arcade games shrinks down to fit in the palm of your hand. From the distinctive music to the climactic boat transformation, this translation does everything it can to replicate the original coin-op adventure, and loses none of the thrills. Driving the lightning-quick G-6155 Interceptor a vehicle that can switch from car to boat to motorcycle you'll try to destroy the N.O.S.T.R.A. organization before it destroys you. You'll use oil slicks, smoke screens, and missiles to knock your foes off the road, out of the air, and below the surface of the water. This version of SPYHUNTER actually serves as something of an update on the original, as there are seven real-world locales to test your resolve, and the gameplay is now mission based. The graphics have also gotten a bit of an overhaul, with visuals taking place in near 3D. Whether or not you had the pleasure of growing up with this game, there's nothing not to love about one of the original white-knuckle spy games.</desc>

They have always had to worry about dragon slayers, plus they usually get a bad rap for being destructive, and let's not even get started on what people say about their breath! Fortunately Spyro has generally avoided such negative opinions, but then again he hasn't always had it easy either. You'd think that after several death-defying adventures on the Playstation over the past few years, which included the defeat of the evil Sorceress, Spyro and his friends would be able to take some time off and enjoy a bit of a vacation at Dragon Shores. But with evil brewing and a new title on the way for the GameBoy Advance, which is due out in November, the gang shouldn't get too comfortable on the beach.</desc>

    <desc>Spyro Orange is Vicarious Visions' first Spyro the Dragon title, taking the reigns after Digital Eclipse's GBA trilogy. For Spyro's fourth appearance on the Game Boy Advance, the development team has given the dragon a more traditional side-scrolling environment for his overworld instead of taking him back to his isometric exploits. But the scrolling platformer is only part of the experience. Spyro Orange focuses on dozens of mini-challenges for its gameplay, like a vertical shooter where Spyro floats around blasting sheep or collecting gems, a rapid-button-tapping challenge involving tug-o-war and ice cube creation, or driving around in a tank, or knocking out a series of bad guys in a Breakout-style challenge. The game supports link cable play for multiplayer challenges.</desc>

    <name>SSX 3 </name>
    <desc>EA Sports returns to the slopes and the insanely fast-paced action of snowboarding with SSX 3 for the GBA. Combining racing with tricks, the game allows players to choose from different events and challenges as they desire. The story mode of SSX 3 involves, like the previous entries in the series, becoming the best snowboarder in the world. Players have a cast of characters to select from, most of whom have appeared in previous SSX games. Once players have selected their character, they're off to the slopes to start winning races and performing huge tricks. The main mode has 12 different events players can participate in. Players select the event they want to compete in from the map. There are races, super pipe, big air, and other events, and there's something for everyone. Winning these events nets the player cash which can be used to upgrade their equipment. In addition to winning the race, players want to look good doing it, and that's where the tricks come in. Pull off enough of them, and the player's boost meter fills, rewarding them with some extra power. Complete enough tricks and the character learns new, even more dangerous and impressive tricks. Gamers who love snowboarding will enjoy SSX 3. While players can't explore as freely as they can in the console version of the game, the racing is still intense, and the many different game play options keep the game from getting boring or repetitive.</desc>

    <name>SSX Tricky  </name>
    <desc>SSX Tricky is EA's follow up to SSX. Tricky features far more storytelling than the original through the use of personality attributes. Rivalries develop between characters with opposing attributes, causing them to act more aggressively towards each other during races. The übertrick system adds a whole new layer to the game. These tricks are much tougher to pull off, but give you a nice boost. Performing six übertricks in a row results in a super übertrick, which rewards you with a bigger boost and causes Run DMC's "It's Tricky" to play. 

Seven tracks return from the original accompanied by brand-new Garibaldi and Alaska tracks. The returning tracks contain up to four times as many shortcuts and hidden lines. Six of the eight riders from the original return (Jurgen and Hiro suffered off-season injuries) and are joined by six new ones. The soundtrack will feature mixes by Mix Master Mike, Aphrodite, and the Plump DJs. DVD-like bonuses include "behind-the-scenes" footage and a "making of" segment.</desc>

    <desc>Stadium Games is a olympiad style sports game where you can compete in these six events:

1. Shooting
2. Archery
3. Javelin
4. Football
5. Pole Vault
6. Hammer Throw

In the Shooting game, you have to shoot down pairs of clay pigeons that are shot in from the side. You view the event from a third person perspective, and have full control of the cross hair. The rest of the events are different. They all use timing meters, one for strength and one for accuracy, where the player has to hit the button at the right spot on the meter. 

Two game modes are available. Practice is the first, where one player can play any of the events at any time, without going through the rest. The second is the tournament where one or two players sharing the same machine can go through all the events. For each event the player will earn points, and there is a high score table for overall scores.</desc>

    <name>Street Fighter Alpha 3 </name>
    <desc>Street Fighter Alpha 3, the third game in the Alpha series, has a total of 31 fighters, the most in the series so far. New characters include old favorites E. Honda, Blanka, Vega, Cammy, T. Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. 

World Tour - Simply choose your fighter and travel around the world, fighting the home town heroes that you run into. The more fights you win, the stronger you fighter becomes. You can also learn new moves, and there are three levels of Super moves to choose from before you start each round (called Isms).

Arcade - A simple conversion of the arcade version. Beat each fighter with your chosen warrior, in three rounds per match (much the same as past versions of Street Fighter)

Versus - Two human players battle it out. 

Training - A good way to learn all the super moves that are available, against a dummy.

Entry - If you save your character during the World Tour mode, you can upload him here to use in the other modes in the game (especially handy for Training).

Finally, if you complete certain areas of the game three new fighters become available, including another old favourite in Guile, Evil Ryu and Shin Akuma.</desc>

As you throw them down the line, they will stack up in piles of six. Linking three bubbles together will pop them (remove them from the field), and if there is a stack of six, the bubbles on the way will form a new stack in front of it.

The aim of the game is to remove all bubbles from the field, but there is another way of completing a game. Tokens will appear during play, and by collecting enough, you can move on to the next round regardless of what you have on the playfield.</desc>

    <desc>Super Bust-A-Move brings with it all of the entertaining puzzle action of the series with the addition of new multiplayer modes and graphical improvements.

The aim of the game, as with the previous titles in the series, is to remove a collected number of coloured bubbles from the game screen. To do so, at the bottom of the screen, you aim and fire the coloured bubbles from a launcher, sending the bubbles upwards into the container. Match three or more together of the same colour to clear them from the screen. If you're too slow, the collection of bubbles moves down the screen towards you, and the game will end if it reaches the bottom.

    <name>Super Collapse! II </name>
    <desc>The game concept is that you have to eliminate clusters of at least 3 blocks with your mouse, but the more you remove at once, the more you score. Once that happens, all blocks above the ones, which have vanished, will fall down and close the gap.

Beneath the lowest row, there you see the new row building up. Once all blocks are present, this row will be now the lowest row, while all others are moving up. Once one block reaches the top of the playfield, you loose.

Each individual level has a preset value of rows, which will build up. To win a level, all you have to do, is to prevent that a full vertical row (from bottom to top) gets stacked up.

The game offers 4 game modes: Traditional, Puzzle, Relapse, and Strategy. Two of them need a brain, while the other two just need a fast hand.

Traditional works like explained above. New rows show automatically, with increasing speed not only from level to level, but also in a level. Means: the level starts slow, but in the end, new rows will complete every second. Power-Ups are available in this game mode.

Relapse works exactly like Traditional, but with one major difference. The action isn't just limited to the bottom of the playfield, in fact, both bottom and top now filling with blocks. Power-Ups used on one side affecting both. How to win is the same, but you loose, when blocks from one side touching the other.

Strategy is one of the two game modes where you must think. Clicking fast will only help to see the Game Over screen. New rows won't appear automatically, instead for each cluster you remove, a full new line will appear. So you have to plan carefully before neutralizing a cluster.

Puzzle is the game mode, where no new lines appear. Also there are no Power-Ups here. But this is the most complex game mode. Your task is to completely remove all blocks, if at least one block is still available, you loose. There is also no time limit, so you can think as long as you want.

The first three game modes offering bonus levels, which works like the Puzzle mode. So, if one block remains, you only scoring the normal points for removed clusters. Only when all blocks are removed, you score the bonus points. There are only two differences: it isn't so complex, and you only have 15 seconds time.

There are 5 different Power-Ups in the game (2 good, 2 bad, 1 depending of the situation): Platform Block (won't move, just blocking the vertical row where it is), Indestructible Block (does move like a regular block, but can't removed with normal actions), Color Bomb (one of each of the 5 colors, will detonate all same colored blocks in it's big radius), Super Bomb (shorter range than the Color Bomb, but blow up all blocks, regardless the color; only way to remove Platform/Indestructible Blocks), and finally, the Gravity Block (only available in Relapse Mode, will shift all blocks from the side where it was activated to the other side).</desc>

    <desc>Go for a spin around Yoshi's island. 
 
Baby-sitting a whiny newborn is about as fun as a head cold on the first day of summer vacation. But when Baby Mario falls from the sky, the Yoshis seize the opportunity to do a lot more than change diapers. 
 
The big-hearted Yoshis vow to reunite Baby Mario with his twin brother on the far side of the island. It won't be easy, but the Yoshis are determined to take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings. 
 
Brilliant game-designer Shigeru Miyamoto has crammed the island's jungles, caves and snowcapped peaks with one brain-bending surprise after another. Hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses and all-new pals await your discovery. 
 
Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower. He can jump, hover, stomp, pound the ground and slurp up enemies. Best of all, he can throw eggs. Heck, Mario even gets to presto-chango into superfast Superstar Mario, while Yoshi morphs into a toy submarine that shoots itty-bitty torpedoes. 
 
As an added bonus, Yoshi's Island includes six super-challenging levels developed just for the GBA. You can also take a break from baby-sitting duties to indulge in multiplayer Mario Bros. action. 
 
In Super Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3, the unlikely duo of Yoshi and Baby Mario must together brave a world of infinite surprise and challenge. Richly varied gameplay, brilliant graphics and precision control perfectly meld in an adventure you won't be able to put down!</desc>

    <desc>This is the standard "Bowser has kidnapped the Princess, and Mario must rescue her" story. In this case, the Princess is transformed into a ball and launched from a Super Mario 64-style cannon, which a pair of goombas aim directly at Bowser's Castle. Mario is also transformed into a ball and chases after her.

There are 5 levels, each consisting of a set of pinball tables. Each table has some exits (including the one below the flippers) that Mario can use to move to other tables. Also, each one holds a star, normally obtained by defeating all enemies on the table. Some exits require that Mario has a certain number of stars. To gain access to Bowser's castle, Mario must defeat the bosses of the first 4 levels, which gives him star keys. The game also features a "Time Attack" mode, which allows players to fight already defeated bosses again.</desc>

    <desc>It is two hundred years after the beginning of the "Space Era", a time period when civilization began expanding into space. However, by the start of the 21st century, two meteors struck and destroyed much of the Earth, sending humanity into chaos. By year 179 of the Space Era, secret technology, dubbed Extra-Over Technology, or EOT, was discovered by the Earth Federal Government within a third meteor that had hit Earth at the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific. Dr. Bian Zoldark, while investigating the meteor, also found out that the creators of the Extra-Over Technology were heading to Earth to reclaim it. In order to defend earth, the government starts to develop a group of humanoid mecha, known as Personal Troopers. 
The alien race that created Extra-Over Technology, called the Aerogaters by the Earth Federal Government, initially attacks an Earth ship sent out to investigate their presence in the far reaches of the solar system. This initial skirmish ends in a defeat for the Aerogaters, prompting them to sue for negotiations with the Earth Federation Army. Talks are arranged to take place at a secret facility in Antarctica, but the talks are targeted by a rogue faction called the Divine Crusaders. 
The Divine Crusaders destroys the Aerogater delegation, then turn on the Federation forces. Bian Zoldark, revealing himself to be the leader of the Divine Crusaders, announces the existence of the Aerogaters to the world and rebel against the Earth Government. As Earth spins into civil war, a new Aerogater force is on the move, seeking to reclaim their lost technology...</desc>

    <desc>In "Tales of Phantasia", you play a young boy named Cless, who lives together with his parents in a quiet village. It was a day like all the others when Cless decided to go hunting with his best friend Chester. Chasing a wild boar, Cless discovered a strange talking tree in the forest who was pleading him for help. But as soon as it stopped speaking, the two friends heard the sound of an alarm. They returned to the village and found it burnt down, and all its inhabitants murdered. Before Cless' mother died in his arms, she told him this terrible massacre had something to do with the pendant she and her husband gave Cless for his birthday... what connection could there be? Cless decides to visit his uncle who lives in another town, but he doesn't realize his journey will take him to much more remote places than that!

"Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.</desc>

    <desc>Thunder Alley is a racing game for the Game Boy Advance where the player takes control of stock-cars. The game is played from a third person perspective and uses Sennari Interactive's ray tracing engine from Driver 2. The cast of the game are all characters from the Tin Pin Alley series of bowling games. The game features two game modes: Practice Race, which is just the player racing around as he wishes, and Tournament Race, where the player competes against AI-controlled drivers. Throughout the game's tracks, the player will come across power ups that boosts the speed of the player car and obstacles that hinder it like for example oil which causes the car to spin around. There's four different tracks in the game, each with its own layout and appearance, although the difference between them is very small.</desc>

    <name>Thunderbirds </name>
    <desc>Based on the live action film released in 2004 (which in turn was based on the 1960s series starring marionettes), Thunderbirds stars Alan, Tin-Tin, and Fermat, three children whose guardians are part of the International Rescue team. The player takes control of all three children as they go through training and are then forced to travel around the world to save members of International Rescue from an evil villain known as The Hood.

The game takes place in locales such as the International Rescue island, Africa, and even outer space. Each of the three characters has his or her own unique abilities that the player must use to solve puzzles and advance through a level. Alan has strength and jumping ability, Tin-Tin has telekinetic powers that are used to move objects, and Fermat can hack computers and roll through holes. While the majority of the gameplay is primarily composed of solving puzzles from an overhead view, there are also flight action sequences where the player can fly one of the many vehicles known as the Thunderbirds.</desc>

    <desc>Join up with your favorite characters from the TINY TOON ADVENTURES universe for some action and excitement. Any fan of the classic cartoon series will go nuts for the near-perfect animation and familiar humor of the television show, but this game goes far beyond the call of duty. Between the long list of well-loved characters and the intense combat design, TINY TOON ADVENTURES: Buster's Bad Dream ranks among the Game Boy Advance elite. Make your way through four unique environments including Acme Forest, Haunted Mansion, Space Station, and a surprise locale partnering up with other Toons to destroy the likes of Elmyra, Montana Max, and many others. Babs Bunny, Dizzy Devil, Buster, and all the rest of the gang appear throughout, and there are plenty of hidden areas and personalities to unlock. The game's team system is such that one player can stun or distract an enemy, opening the door for the other player to inflict serious damage. The relationship between cartoon characters and violence dates back a ways, and TINY TOON ADVENTURES isn't about to break up the love affair.</desc>

    <desc>What happens when you take classic puzzle gaming and toss in some of the most lovable characters in cartoon history? You get one undeniably awesome game. Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, and the rest of the TINY TOONS crew are ready for fun, and you're in the driver's seat. The basic premise of this addicting, original title is to arrange pairs of colored eggs, dropping them onto the screen to create combinations. Of course, there are numerous obstacles and would-be detractors to make things more difficult (UFOs, Tasmanian Devils), and time is never on your side. There are plenty of characters from the animated series along for the adventure including Hampton J. Pig and Fifi La Fume and each is prepared for puzzle-style battle. As many as four players can link up to see who has the quickest reflexes, and there are plenty of single-player modes to keep you busy as well. If you're a TINY TOONS fan, this one is a must-have. If you're not a fan well, you should be.</desc>

    <name>TMNT  </name>
    <desc>Cowabunga! Take control of your favourite turtle ninjas as you play through the events of the 2007 CGI movie. The turtles have grown apart, and Raphael has taken to crime fighting solo under the guise of the Nightwatcher.  The Foot Clan are turning up in the streets again, and a mysterious man known as Winters seems to be involved with them. Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets!

The Game Boy Advance version of TMNT can be best described as similar to the NES game River City Ransom.  Players take control of either a specific turtle or the turtle of their choice (depending on the mission), and fight through waves of enemies in a sidescrolling beat-em-up style.  Enemies will drop the usual health pickups, but also drop money and weaponry.  Money can be used to purchase weapons or upgrades between missions, while weapons can be used as a more powerful tool to defeat your foes (however, these weapons have a limited use).  After the completion of a mission, experience is earned, and after a certain amount of experience is gained, you can level up the turtles to improve their fighting statistics.

Each turtle has their own specific weapon: Leonardo with his dual Katana, Michelangelo with his Nunchucks, Donatello with his Bo Staff and Raphael with his two Sai.  These weapons are used in their standard attacks.  A basic attack is performed with the B Button, but you can perform different attacks with B and other buttons such as the directions of the Control Pad and the A Button.  Uppercuts, Sweep Kicks, Jump Kicks and more can be performed, and you can even juggle enemies in the air to get more hits in and increase your score.</desc>

Pushing aside realism, Sk8land goes with a cel-shaded atmosphere, where the same gameplay mechanics of skaing around each park completing objectives and challenges are as addictive as always.

Nintendo DS players will also take Sk8land online through the wi-fi mode, along with touch screen controls. GBA players aren't left behind either, with an updated create-a-park and skater modes and multiplayer to boot.</desc>

    <name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 </name>
    <desc>The Tony Hawk skateboarding series makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with this adaptation of the second Pro Skater game.

Gameplay is similar to the original console game. The levels have been adapted from the console version for the two dimensional isometric perspective; one is even taken from the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

In Career Mode, choose from one of 13 professional skaters and, in each level, complete various goals like collecting items, performing special tricks and of course breaking high scores by performing tricks and combos. Completing the goals earns money which unlocks new levels and can be spent on new boards, tricks and upgrading your skater's stats. In competition levels, you don't skate for money but compete for a medal.

In the Free Skate and Single Session modes, unlocked levels can be practiced and new high scores be established.</desc>

    <desc>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics.

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

    <name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 </name>
    <desc>THPS4 is the fourth game in Activision's ever popular franchise.

The main feature of this game is it's redesigned career mode.  When beginning a level, you have all the time in the world to skate around, perform tricks, get a feel for the level, without the hassel of any goals or time limits.  When you're ready to attempt a goal, simply find a pro skater, talk to him, then receive the goal, similar to Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX.  Goals are similar to the previous games, such as collect SKATE, get a certain amount of points, transfer over this and grind that.  There are new goals, however, such as collecting the word COMBO while doing one big combo.  Miss a trick, and goal fails.  Once all regular goals are accomplished, you can attempt the Pro Goal, which is specific to each skater, and is extremely hard.

All the major skaters are here, including Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Rune Gilfberg, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska, Andrew Reynolds, Geoff Rowley, Elissa Steamer and Jamie Thomas.

The levels are been expanded and are huge.  Some of the levels include a college campus, a shipyard, and the infamous prison complex Alcatraz.

For multiplayer, all the favorite modes are back, from Graffiti and Trick Attack to Horse and King Of The Hill.  New modes include Capture The Flag and Combo Mambo.  THPS4 also supports System Link play, but not XBox Live.

The PlayStation 2 version offers everything from the XBox version, but also has online play, utilizing either your own network adaptor or the official one.  The PS2 version also features a one level demo of Shaun Murray's Pro Wakeboarder, which is not featured on any other version of the game.</desc>

Changes in this iteration include removing the timer from most goals in story mode, allowing you to have several active at once and new moves like the nata spin, tantrum, which allows you to recover from a bail without losing everything, focus, where you can slow time in order to land the best trick and sticker-slapping.</desc>

    <desc>Top Gear GT Championship carries the official Japanese GT title and lets players race fast cars on different GT tracks. The game features two main game modes: quick race and championship. In quick race, players can alone, against another human player or create custom courses for the game. This is further divided into versus games against the computer and time attack. The game can also connect through mobile phones to check global rankings, enter local ranking entries, and download ghosts and new courses.

In the championship mode, players need to complete the courses in a fixed order while a ranking is kept. The cars are shown from a third-person perspective and there are different AI-controlled racers to beat. Prior to the races, players can do free runs, qualify and eventually start the race or tune the car further. There are two weather types, sunny and rainy, which affects the handling of the cars.

There are different cars and courses to choose from, with extensive tuning options based on the gear ratio, steering, brakes, tires, aerodynamic settings and the height handicap. There are also three difficulty levels.</desc>

The game contains exciting tennis gameplay, a number of different modes, and a lot of fun. Career mode, the main mode of the game, has players creating a male or female character from scratch using the game's fairly deep customization mode. Once their player is created and named, gamers move to the court. First comes several training rounds with the coach, who will teach players everything then need to know about controlling their character, serving, and returning the ball in TOP SPIN 2. However, each lesson costs money, so players will need to quickly enter a low-level tournament to earn some cash. Many of the tournaments won't be available at the beginning, but as players win matches and earn rankings, more difficult tournaments will open up. Eventually, players will find themselves facing off against big name tennis stars like Andy Roddick, Venus Williams, Roger Federer, Maria Sharapova, Lindsay Davenport, and Lleyton Hewitt. Gamers can also play quick games as either singles or doubles, play an exhibition match, play three different mini-games in party mode, and take on friends using the Game Boy Advance link. Overall, players who love tennis and the challenge it brings will love TOP SPIN 2.</desc>

    <desc>Take a one-wheeled bike for a spin in the futuristic world of Trick Star!  Choose from four up and coming riders, and compete in the Ibex, Glyder and Kotsu Leagues to become the ultimate champion!

Trick Star is a futuristic racing game where the racers ride slick one-wheeled bikes. Players race along the track, with the goal of not only coming first, but also performing stunts to impress the crowds. Stunts cannot be performed until a certain speed is reached, and the "Trick Star" appears on the HUD. When it appears, players can perform a stunt by holding L or R, as well as any direction on the Control Pad. Performing stunts also fills your boost meter - when it is full, you can press L and R simultaneously to get an extra boost.

In League Mode, players must complete three tracks, as well as scoring enough points to qualify for the Challenge Mode. Once the player has enough points, they can enter Challenge Mode, where they are asked to perform a particular set of stunts in between markers. When they succeed, they are rewarded with additional stunts and progress to the next set of tracks.

Trick Star also includes one player at a time multiplayer, for up to four players. Players can compete in Time Trial (aim for the fastest time), Stunts (get the highest stunt point score), Long Jump (jump the longest distance along the track) and Challenges (complete the required challenges). After each player has had a go, the results are shown.</desc>

Tringo was developed first by Nathan Keir within Second Life, a virtual world that encourages players to create their own content. Brought to the GBA, this handheld version is optimized for portable play for quick play and multiplayer gaming.</desc>

    <name>Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2 - Bush Rescue  </name>
    <desc>The Game Boy Advance rendition of Ty the Tasmanian Tiger 2: Bush Rescue is essentially a 2D-ized version of the 3D console design. The GBA title follows the exact story structure of the console platformer, right down to the still screens lifted out of the animated cutscenes. Gameplay-wise, Ty 2 is a traditional platformer that puts heavy emphasis on boomerang action. Players control Ty through huge levels that go all over the map; up, down, left, right... and each location and situation on the handheld is based specifically on the same location and situation in the console. The sprite graphics of Ty and his pals have been rendered from the 3D assets of the console bigger brother to retain a consistent feel throughout the game design. There are elements that are original to the GBA game; character profiles during conversations, for example, are supplied by drawn stills unique to the handheld game.</desc>

    <name>Ultimate Spider-Man </name>
    <desc>ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN is Activision's third SPIDER-MAN game and the first to be based off the comics rather than the new movies. The GBA game puts players in control of the web-slinging Spider-Man as he does battle with Venom and other enemies while getting help from some familiar superheroes. The story of Spider-Man begins when 15 year old Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider. He soon realizes he has the ability to climb walls and to sense things. Shortly after being bitten, Peter and friend Eddie Brock discover a mysterious black suit that their fathers created before their deaths. Eddie ends up putting on the suit, which turns him into the powerful villain known as Venom. Peter must battle his childhood friend and other villains like the Green Goblin, Carnage, and Electro to save the city. In story mode, players can walk around New York City as much as they wish as they accomplish side-missions or move the plot along. Instead of walking, though, Spider-Man can shoot webs onto tall buildings and swing his way around the city while capturing gang members and stopping crimes. He also must stop Venom's plot and defeat the other villains. Players will also enjoy seeing Spider-Man joined by allies like Wolverine and the Human Torch for some scenes. Fans of the comics will enjoy how ULTIMATE SPIDER-MAN draws on the comic style and storyline, while movie fans will like getting to see another chapter in the Spider-Man legacy.</desc>

The story is much stronger this time around, with the player exploring three colorful city environments, including the New Orleans-influenced SimQuarter, the shiny Glasstown district, the gritty Urbania, and even a haunted bayou inhabited by two creepy Cajun brothers. 
 
In addition to the traditional Sims gameplay of satisfying motives, making friends, and decorating an apartment, the player can experience eight job minigames, a "xizzle" system that lets players learn special abilities, and several new vehicles, including a motorcycle, hoverboard, and fanboat. Combine all that with a wacky sense of humor, and you get The Urbz: Sims in the City.</desc>

    <desc>The action-adventure game features LarryBoy, the popular plunger-headed crime-fighting cucumber featured in several best-selling videos, in his quest to save the citizens of Bumblyburg from temptation. When trouble appears, the citizens of Bumblyburg call world-famous crime fighter LarryBoy! Aided only by his trusted butler Alfred (played with zest by Archibald Asparagus), LarryBoy is everything that his alter-ego Larry the Cucumber is not: bold... confident... relentlessly driven... brazenly heroic! Well, actually, that's not entirely true. While he tries to create this impression, inside, LarryBoy is still plain-old Larry. LarryBoy attempts to save the day with clever use of his super-suction ears and the many features of the Larry-Mobile. Call him a kinder, gentler, slightly slower superhero!</desc>

    <desc>Wakeboarding is the new addition to the Activision line of extreme sports titles.

A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sports name).

Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way.

Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks.</desc>

    <name>Whac-A-Mole </name>
    <desc>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.

The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</desc>

    <desc>It has been some twelve years since the destruction of Kilrah, the Kilrathi homeworld. The Terran Confederation, slowly demobilizing and reorganizing its military assets, has settled on a new strategy: building several Midway-class megacarriers, brainchild of Navy Commodore Christopher Blair. These new carriers, over a kilometer long, carry all the hardware and weaponry of a Kilrathi-War-era carrier battle group. The first one, the Midway herself, is undergoing her shakedown cruise, with Blair along for the ride. Before this, though, the player is treated to a CGI video of a bizarre rupture in space in the Kilrah system: the first of the Nephilim invaders. The game's titular prophecy involves the coming of these alien invaders, who shall arrive only after "one who has the heart of a Kilrathi, but who is not Kilrathi-born," conquers the felinoid warrior race.</desc>

The missions usually come in three flavors: Top-down view bombing missions where you have to take out strategically important targets, isometric strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: Dogfights in the sky. Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.

The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</desc>

    <name>WinX Club </name>
    <desc>Winx Club is an action adventure game based on the Italian cartoon series of the same name. The story is similar to that of Harry Potter, only this time the main character is a fairy. She gets to go to a fairy school in fairytale world called Magix where she has to find her true self. This game is similar to the Windows and Playstation 2 versions, except that instead of a 3D third person perspective it features a 2D top-down perspective of the game world.

This game loosely retells the story of the first season of the television series.

There are "action" and "adventure"levels. In the adventure levels gameplay consists of finding items for specific NPCs and playing various mini-games. In the action levels the player has to jump, climb and fight enemies. The main character, Bloom, has a magic shield and two attacks that improve during the game. She can also cast a number of spells that can aid her in finding the items she needs. During boss battles Bloom changes to her Winx form in which she is more powerful and can fly. During the levels there are various items to be picked up which improve Blooms health or attacks or unlock new outfits that can be worn.</desc>

    <path>./Wolfenstein 3D (USA, Europe).zip</path>
    <name>Wolfenstein 3D </name>
    <desc>Inspired by the top-down infiltration game Castle Wolfenstein, this episodic first-person shooter (FPS) puts the player in the boots of  B.J. Blazkowicz, an allied spy. There are six episodes (the first distributed complete as shareware), the second, and the third available after registration and the three final missions (which happen before the events of the first episode) available in the "Nocturnal Missions" pack. However, they do not need to be played in sequence to be enjoyed!

In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. was captured, but overpowered a guard with the help of a concealed knife and managed to get out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The final mission (Die, Führer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit) himself. The Nocturnal Missions are focused on the Nazi plans for chemical warfare, and start with Dark Secret, where B.J. hunts for lead researcher Dr. Otto Giftmacher. It's followed by Trail of the Madman, where the goal is capturing the war plans guarded by Gretel Grosse, and the final episode Confrontation, where B.J. meets General Fettgesicht, the planner for the chemical assault.

Each episode has nine levels (eight regular and a final boss level), plus a secret level activated by an hidden switch somewhere in the eight first levels. Regular levels often feature a maze-like appearance or large areas with many enemies (the number of them on each area depends on the difficulty level), where the player must reach the exit elevator. To do so, he must kill the enemies (while it's possible to move behind the guards' backs and even there's a slight bonus in attacking them from behind, most enemies have to be dealt with by fire power), and depending on the level, activate "push walls" and/or get silver and golden keys to open certain doors.

Many objects can be found in a level, from medikits, chicken meals, and even dog food (to restore health), ammo and treasures, which solely exist for points. There are four weapons (knife, pistol, machine gun and Gatling), all of them using the same bullets except the knife. The knife and the pistol are given at the start of the level, while the machine gun is either found (usually in secret areas) or picked up from SS troopers and the Gatling is always dropped somewhere in the level. There are five kinds of enemies (excluding bosses) - Dogs (fast, but more a nuisance than life-threatening), Army Soldiers (dressed in regular brown outfit, not very powerful but usually found in large groups), Officers (dressed in white, armed with a very accurate pistol and tough to kill), SS Troopers (blue attire, armed with a machine gun and tough to kill), and Mutants (the rarest and toughest of regular enemies, pale-skinned troopers with green clothes and a machine gun stuck in their chest).

Unlike modern FPS games, the player has a number of lives and once the player loses the last life, the game ends. To win extra lives, the player has to either find the 1-up item in the level or get 20,000 points (by killing enemies and capturing treasures or completing a level below the 'par' time while killing all enemies, finding all secrets by pushing walls, and collecting all treasure points).</desc>

    <name>Worms Blast  </name>
    <desc>The gameplay is similar to that of Puzzle Bobble/Bust-A-Move, but with several key differences. There is a hexagonal grid of coloured blocks at the top of the screen, while the player's character sits on a boat floating in water. Unlike Puzzle Bobble, it is able to move side to side. There are multiple weapons that can be used, however the only weapon the player has to start with is a bazooka. As with Worms, holding down the fire button increases the power behind the weapon's launch, affecting how far it will travel. It is possible to fire the bazooka (and some other weapons, such as the grenade and dynamite) in an "arch", allowing players to reach difficult areas.

Shooting blocks will have one of two effects:

If you hit a block that is either the same colour as your bazooka missile, or is a rainbow block, that block and any other same-coloured or rainbow blocks connected to it will be destroyed. Any blocks that are not the same colour will not be affected; however, if the only thing holding those blocks up is the coloured blocks you have just destroyed, those blocks will fall into the water.

If you hit a block that is a different colour from your bazooka missile, or is a "dead block" - an uncoloured, grey block - it will be recoloured to match the missile.

(Weapons are affected differently by other blocks. This is covered further below.)</desc>

At first sight, Worms World Party may seem very similar to Worms Armageddon. However, this time the game has been specially designed with multiplayer in mind. Up to 6 players can battle out at the same time on local networks or on the internet, using Team17 own matchmaking service, called Wormnet.

Other welcomed additions are the Wormpot, which can provide 400 gameplay variations from "Goliath Mode" to "Bleeding Worms", hundreds of new landscapes, flags and fanfares, and a load of single player missions.</desc>

    <name>Yggdra Union - We'll Never Fight Alone </name>
    <desc>Ruled by a royal family said to be descendants of the gods themselves, Fantasinia is a prosperous and peaceful land -- until the peace is shattered by the invading forces of the Empire of Bronkia. Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.</desc>

It's up to Yoshi to save the day in Yoshi Topsy-Turvy. The game is divided into six chapters, each containing numerous stages. The player will have to tilt the world (using the tilt sensor) to help Yoshi climb walls, open new paths, and send enemies rolling away. Happiness Medals should be earned, allowing the player to move on to the next chapter if Yoshi successfully clears certain objectives that the Spirits ask of him. Along the way, Yoshi will be transformed into a ship, a ball, and a balloon.</desc>

    <desc>Yu-Gi-Oh! returns in the form of a Tournament edition which will be used in an official Worldwide Tournament in 2004 in Los Angeles.  The game also has a text translation utility that will allow gamers who link with one another to translate text automatically between languages.  The languages included are Japanese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and English.  These are also the languages you can view the game in.

The game continues the tradition of the Yu-Gi-Oh! card battles.  There is little to the game other than battling your opponents.  This game is a sequel to Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition: Stairway to the Destined Duel and offers more than 1000 cards to use as well as new opponents.  The game takes out some of the non-card battling features from the Worldwide Edition and leaves you with the battling as the main feature of the game.

Build up to three decks with the cards you gain as you work to beat all your opponents.  With over 1000 cards, you will have a wide range of choices for your 40-card decks.

As with the Worldwide Edition, you can also trade your cards with friends through the Link Cable.</desc>

    <desc>ZooCube is a puzzle game that involves matching parts of animals to eliminate them and get points.

The Cube is a 3D object in the center of the screen and the animal parts fall towards it. In a similar style to Tetris the player must keep the sides from building too high. It is a quickly paced, real-time game and at later stages the player struggles to juggle the cube items to keep eliminating animals on all sides. Power-ups can be used to destroy animal parts, get points, or to make life more difficult for the player's opponents, such as by speeding up the rate at which animal parts fall to their cube, or reduce how fast their cube can spin.</desc>
