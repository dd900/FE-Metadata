    <name>Airboarder 64 </name>
    <desc>Air Boarder is a game that resembles skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater but with a certain aspect of it being quite different. Instead of the usual skateboards the game features hoover boards.

1 Player option features the following modes:

1. Lecture – mode where you can learn the controls and the terms the game uses.

2. Street Work – the main mode of the game. At the beginning there are 4 available characters (total of 8), 5 stages and 4 boards (total of 12) from which you can choose. At each stage you are given a time limit in which you must perform as many tricks as possible with your board. There are also yellow circles lying around that you must pass through. Each time you pass through one the timer resets back and if you pass through all the game ends regardless of how much time is left. When the game ends you get a rank depending on the points you accumulated and if the rank is high enough a level of higher difficulty is unlocked (with a total of 3 difficulty levels per stage).

3. Time Attack – you must pass through all the coloured circles in a designated order and within the least time possible. The spots where the circles are can be seen via a map that appears on the screen.

4. Coin – mode in which you must get all the coins that are scattered on each stage within the time limit.

5. Free Run – this mode is free of challenges (no time limit or points) and mostly serves as a means of getting you acquainted with each stage.

2 Players option features the following modes:

1. Vs. Race – 2 Player race where the one that passes through all of the yellow circles, in the order that is specified wins.

6. Vs. Coin – another 2 Player mode where the player who gets all the coins or has the most when the time limit ends wins.</desc>

Of course, the pot's answer doesn't please the hag-- he singles out Banjo's sister, Tooty. When Tooty turns up missing, Banjo and his birdie buddy Kazooie set out to find her. 

The worlds in Banjo-Kazooie are gigantic, and chock full of crazy items to collect. Musical Notes, Puzzle Pieces ("Jiggies"), Mumbo Tokens, and Jinjoes are just some of the swag that Banjo must stuff in his backpack to complete his adventure. While some of the necessary items are simply stashed off the beaten path, others will require puzzle solving skills to turn up.</desc>

As nothing but a skeleton, Grunty and her sisters plan a way of curing her looks by sucking the life out of the land so as to restore her body to its old self. On hearing this news, our two champs Banjo and Kazooie with the aid of Mumbo set out to stop the evil plan and seek revenge for the passing away of Bottles the mole.

In this sequel to Banjo-Kazooie, you can play as the two main characters (as well as Mumbo) just like before, although they can now separate, helping them get to even harder areas of the land. You must collect jiggies to open new areas (much like the original) as well as learn 40 new moves to help you get along.

And much like another Rareware title, Donkey Kong 64, you can play four-player minigames that range from first-person shooters, bumper cars, battle for points, etc..</desc>

You can create and save up to 7 anglers through the “Create Angler” option and customize stats such as sex, hair, face, clothes, etc. Other customizable options include “Lake Conditions” (lake location, season, weather, time, etc.), “Boat” (boat model, engine, etc.) and “Tackle” (rod/reel, line, lure, etc.). These are the following modes:

1. Exhibition - the only mode where every customizable option is available. The objective is to catch up to a certain number of fish and the sum of their weight to equal or surpass the weight that is mentioned in the beginning of the mode.

2. Tournament - there are 6 tournaments you must compete in and each tournament lasts for 3 days. Fishing lasts until the day is over at the end of which the total weight of fish caught is counted and depending on how well you did you get the equivalent rank. If at the end of the last tournament you manage to rank 5th or higher place new equipment and boats are unlocked. 

3. Speed Fishing - in this mode you’re given a time limit of 3 minutes and must catch as more of the fish mentioned in the overview as possible. Time is extended by one second depending on how much the fish weighs and the objective is to fish for as long as you can.

4. Casting Game - you must cast the line at certain spots on the lake which are specified by coloured circles within the time limit. With each target you manage to hit you receive points and if the points that are accumulated are high enough you get additional time and the patterns in which the targets appear change.</desc>

    <name>Big Mountain 2000 </name>
    <desc>Big Mountain 2000 is a sports game where you can choose to race with either a snowboard or a ski. There are six characters (plus three unlockables) to choose from, each with different skills and three modes in total – two of them are single player and the other one is a multiplayer.

1. Championship: in Championship you can select one of the available players and choose the style you want – ski or snowboard.  You can also change each player’s equipment which includes ski/snowboard and clothes. The game also lets you choose in which stage you want to compete and the race type you want to play. Race Type includes three options – Free Ride, Slalom and Giant Slalom. In Free Ride you compete against 3 more CPU players, you must finish first and before time, which can be renewed at every checkpoint, runs out. In Slalom and Giant Slalom you must pass through the flags that are scattered throughout the course and again like in Free Ride finish first. The differences between the Slalom-Giant Slalom are the later’s course being wider and the flags less. By successfully completing any of the above your players skills like cornering, acceleration, etc. are increased.

2. 2P Battle: in 2P Battle two human players can compete in any of the Free Ride-Slalom-Giant Slalom races. It is possible to either choose a player from the game or load a previously saved player data from a Controller Pak. There are also no restrictions on the style each player will choose. For example one may choose to play with a skier and the other with a snowboarder.

3. Time Attack: there are no other competitors in this mode – just you racing against time.</desc>

    <name>Blast Corps  </name>
    <desc>Get out of the way!  A nuclear missile carrier is out of control on a one way-set path, and unless that path is cleared, it will explode as soon as it makes contact with anything, destroying the world. It is up to you to clear the path so that nothing gets in the way of the Carrier.

Blast Corps is a mix of an action and a puzzle game where destruction is key. At the start of each level the player is given a certain vehicle (ranging from robotic suits, trucks, or bulldozers), and are told to clear the path for the Carrier. Players need to use their heavy-duty equipment to destroy any buildings, structures, or monuments that stand in the path of the Carrier. The difficulty increases as progress is made, though. Smaller vehicles don't affect certain buildings, and sometimes its not even a building that's in the way. The player must use the resources around them to clear the path. Players may need a train flatbed to fill a gap, or a crane to move boxes out of the way. The Carrier is always moving, so once the player is done destroying one obstruction, they must get to the next one quickly. While players pursue their mission they must also find six scientists scattered throughout the globe to form a think-tank to solve the problem. The Carrier has to leave Earth, and it's your job to ensure that it does!

Blast Corps features many secrets to find. Besides clearing each path for the Carrier, players can go back to a level once ts over to take their time and explore. To fully complete a level, players must also find RDU's (Radiation Dispersal Units) which light up on the ground when the player is in close proximity to them. Players must also destroy all of the buildings, and rescue all of the homeless civilians, which is done by the T-chopper that accompanies the player on every mission. There are also dozens of secret time trial levels that can be found by activating special satellite dishes hidden throughout the levels. If the player manages to get all of the secrets in a level they receive a second medal, and once all of the gold medals are found the developers have a tiny message for them...</desc>

You accomplish that by jumping over obstacles, beating a lot of people and collecting coins, notes, wrenches, keys and whatnot in four levels; Prison, Chicago, Graveyard &amp; Swamp. After each level you will free one new band member. Additionally, they throw in some rhythm action, where you have to press the right buttons at the right time in order to proceed.

    <desc>The inhabitants of Bomber World have a unique philosophy of life: if something gets in the way, blow it up. Now you, too, can join in the fun with Hudson Soft's Bomberman 64.

In Bomberman 64's all-new one-player Adventure mode, marauders have set their sights on Bomberman's peaceful planet. You'll explore labyrinthine levels by dropping bombs, solving puzzles and finding hidden items. The action takes place across five brightly colored worlds: a smoldering volcano, ruined castle, icy mountain range, orbiting space station and storybook village. Find all 100 Gold Cards in the first five worlds and you can access a sixth world.

To maximize your score, you'll need to finish each of the 20 levels as quickly as possible. Deadlines are tighter on the Hard difficulty setting. Despite the prevalence of incendiary devices, Bomberman 64's overhead perspective, cartoon-like graphics and bright palette gives the game the cheerful feel of Super Mario RPG. 

It's Bomberman 64's multiplayer mode, though, that really blows the socks off the pyrotechnicians at Power Source. In Single Battle mode, dashing about the baffling arenas and blowing each other to smithereens proves to be, well, a blast. Team Battle mode is a highly explosive version of capture-the-flag. Your goal here is to destroy the enemy team's gems while protecting your own. 

You can choose the number and duration of battles. You can also choose from three levels of artificial intelligence for CPU-controlled bombers. When the Ghost option is selected, your little guy will return as a wispy double of his old self after he's gone boom. Ghosts can control a normal Bomberman, but they cannot deploy bombs.

You'll savor Bomberman 64's sneaky new features, including extremely high explosives and the ability to toss or kick your bombs diagonally. Other new features include the ability to pump up bombs, knock foes unconscious, grab and toss unconscious foes, and toss or kick bombs diagonally. Bomberman 64 is a blast!</desc>

    <name>Castlevania  </name>
    <desc>Konami's long-running series of Castlevania games makes its debut on the N64. The traditional 2D graphics have been left behind; this is the first Castlevania game in 3D. However, the goal of the game remains the same: kick some vampire butt as you battle the evil Count Dracula and his minions in this platformer.

The player can either choose to be Reinhardt Schneider (for the traditional whip action) or Carrie Fernandez (who uses magical powers). Both characters have their own story line. A nice feature is the presence of an in-game clock which changes the time of the day (either day or night).

Reinhardt &amp; Carrie both appear again in the second Castlevania game for the N64: Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness, which has new layouts for the levels of this game.</desc>

    <desc>Set in the year 1844, the game stars the man-beast Cornell in his quest to prevent his adoptive sister, Ada, from being used as a sacrifice to resurrect Dracula. The game opens as Cornell arrives at his village, which has been burned to the ground by Dracula's minions. He finds Ada's pendant in a doorway and follows her scent to Dracula's castle. 
 
During the course of the game, Cornell comes upon a grand estate owned by the Oldrey family: J.A. Oldrey, the master of the Villa, Mary, his wife, and Henry, their son. Gilles de Rais and Actrise have turned Oldrey Senior into a vampire. At Mary's request, Cornell guides Henry to safety. Later in life, Henry returns to Castlevania to save kidnapped children.</desc>

    <desc>Charlie Blast is a construction worker, but quite different than his more famous colleague. Charlie has a convincing beer belly, he has trouble keeping his jeans up (yup, you will get a nice view of his crack quite frequently) and his chest hair makes David Hasselhoff feel ashamed about himself. He is not trying to save a princess either; his mission is to blow islands up with TNT!

With 3D graphics and some platform elements, Charlie Blast's Territory, a remake of Kablooey, is a modernization of one of the classic puzzle genres where your goal is to push crates into the correct spots. 

Every level is an island. On every island you have at least one bomb and one TNT box. Your goal is to push all of them next to each others and then blow everything up in a huge chain reaction. When you do, you advance a level. You cannot pull the crates but you can climb over them.</desc>

After the briefing from your XO, you are set to destroy something - tanks, other helicopters, planes, radars, buildings etc. While the mission only requires you to do something specific, destroying everything gives you bonuses and money, which you can then use to buy more heavy-duty missiles between the missions.

If you look at the screenshots, you might think that Chopper Attack is a helicopter simulation. It's not. Your elevation is fixed. There are no physics. You have boss fights with GIANT choppers. The game is pure 3D action, plain and simple.</desc>

    <desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

In this case, Conker has had one hell of a night, and when he wakes up not only does he have a huge hangover, but something just doesn't feel right. So it's up to Conker and his many skills to clean things up. 

Conker goes through plenty of wild and wacky levels, most of which are based on classic movies including The Matrix, Jaws, Aliens, The Terminator and even Eyes Wide Shut. A multiplayer mode is also included, allowing 4 players to battle it out in many different styles of multiplayer gameplay.</desc>

Cars range from sportcars to more esoteric cars like trucks, minis, and police vehicles. Tracks model real life (Alaska, India, Korea, etc.) and eventually branch out into fantasy worlds (Atlantis, Amazon, Mars).</desc>

Players take control of the vehicle from a third-person perspective, and while avoiding various hazards along the way, must beat the clock as well as the CPU controlled rivals to gain first-place.

With fourteen courses to ultimately choose from, Cruis'n USA takes players on a tour across some of the most famous and notorious roads and highways across the continent. Some of the locations include: Golden Gate Park, Redwood Forest, Beverly Hills and the Grand Canyon.</desc>

    <desc>Pack your bags and prepare for a first class trip around the world. Your ticket is courtesy of Midway, who has transformed its arcade mega-hit Cruis'n World into an all-new racer for the N64. 

Cruis'n USA thrilled racers with a scenic trip across the highways of America, but this time the action will take you all around the world. Each track is packed full of realistic scenery and authentic landmarks, so playing this game could save you a lot of dough on travel expenses. You can catch a glimpse of the Sphinx, the Statue of Liberty, and the Mayan ruins without leaving the security of your living room couch. 

 If you're looking for a realistic racing simulation with real world physics, then this is definitely not the game for you. The graphics are realistic, but the actual game play is twisted to the extreme. Even though blazing across the Great Wall of China may be unbelievable, it certainly is fun. You can leap-frog over a semi truck with a police car, or perform a back flip with a military ATV. Add to this a bonus race that takes place on the moon, and you have a good idea of Midway's over-the-top execution of the Cruis'n concept. 

Many of us will never get the chance to visit the Egyptian pyramids, let alone the opportunity to drive a screaming ambulance straight through them. Cruis'n World provides fun fantasy racing action, and the best thing about it is that you won't have to worry about your luggage getting left behind in Russia.</desc>

    <name>Destruction Derby 64 </name>
    <desc>Much like other Destruction Derby titles, the aim of the game is to race through to the finish, while taking out the other cars for points and not crashing out yourself. 

In this addition, up to 4 players can play, with options including a straight out Derby, Capture the Flag, arena battles and much more. 

There are 12 single player tracks to go through, and plenty of cars to use, including a taxi car (which you must complete the game to unlock).</desc>

    <name>Dezaemon 3D </name>
    <desc>Dezaemon 3D is more of a game creator than an actual game. While it ships with two games, what really makes the cartridge special is the editor. It is far more than a level editor - you can use it to design your own 3D shooting game! In fact, both games were done with the very same editor. 

Designing 3D models, doing textures and composing a hit song are no small tasks mind you, so if you are more of the impatient type, you can skip the editor and head straight for the two sample games, Solid Gear and Usagi. Both games are shooters, but that is the only thing they have in common. 

Solid Gear is a "serious" (and a difficult) shooter, where you are in a middle of a war, shooting enemy warships, tanks and even mechs. 

Usagi is your typically untypical Japanese weirdness where you must defend yourself against robots, missiles.. and bunnies. A whole lot of bunnies.</desc>

    <path>./Diddy Kong Racing (USA) (En,Fr) (Rev 1).zip</path>
    <name>Diddy Kong Racing   </name>
    <desc>It's an island takeover when the evil space wizard, Wizpig, discovers Tiger Island!  After the islands prized racetracks become sealed up, Timber Tiger contacts his friend Diddy Kong to help him reclaim the racetracks and save the island before his parents return.  Along for the ride are the Kremling spy Krunch, Bumper Badger, Banjo (prior to meeting Kazooie in Banjo-Kazooie), pre-sweary Conker, Tiptup Turtle, and Pipsy Mouse.

Diddy Kong Racing is a racing game with similarities to Mario Kart 64, in that you race with a variety of cheery racers while using weapons.  However, the similarities end there.  DKR includes an adventure mode, which features bosses, an overworld to explore, many hidden secrets, the addition of hovercrafts and planes, and a unique way of racing called the "Silver Coin Challenge".  In this mode, in addition to coming first, you must also find the eight Silver Coins deviously hidden throughout the courses (some in alternate paths).

The game also features a strategic method of using weapons.  Each colored balloon on the track matches a specific weapon, and collecting the same type of balloon multiple times in a row powers it up (to a maximum of three times).  This gives the player the choice of snatching every balloon available and using it immediately, or storing the existing weapon, and using a more powerful version of it later.

Up to four players can compete in the races, but in order to play new tracks, they must first be unlocked in the single player game.  There are also four battle modes of play - two standard deathmatch maps, a capture-the-flag style battle where you must nab eggs and hatch three of them in your home nest, and another where you must be the first to return ten bananas to your treasure chest (with the limitation of only being able to hold two at any one time).</desc>

The Dead Shall Rise - Now the Dragon Sword is held by its chosen owner, the quests path must be found. The journey so far has been easy; seemingly guided by the very things that block the way. The only clear way is the Darrc-way. 
 
Crush Your Enemies - At last, a chance to stray from the Darrc-path; if only a boat could be acquired. A nagging thought remains the Darrc Lords must have a great interest in the Dragon Sword and its wielder. To raise the dead is no cheap trick. 
 
Infestation - Port-Town: Normally a busy and bustling port. but now an erie and ominous silence hangs over the place. The Darrc hoards seemed to be gathering forces at the Barracks using the Harbour to accelerate their conquests of the neighboring lands. 
 
The Law of Disorder - It is now clear that the Darrc forces have spread their influence further than could be foretold. With Avantaria turned to Darcc, the very fabric of reality is changing. Ahead a mansion looms. Perhaps within lies the quests goal. 
 
The Abyss - With Draccar defeated something strange has happened to the world. Reality has been changed, some new evil is upon the land but you must fight on. 
 
Darrc Pilgrimage - You sense that your quest is nearing the end, but what will the end mean for you. Soon you will find out who has been responsible for desecrating your lands.</desc>

    <desc>Duke Nukem 3D makes its way to the N64 for the first time, with plenty of new additions:

Weapons: New weapons include two sub-machine guns (one in each hand), the Expander (the bad guys just go pop!) a plasma cannon (which is chargeable) and a grenade launcher. Sadly, there are a few missing from the original PC version, including the Ripper Chaingun, the Devastator, and the Freeze-Ray.

Presentation: The biggest changes come here, as there are new areas to explore, some improved environments, and the same wise cracks that have made Duke famous. There are also some jokes hidden away based on classic movies (Clockwork Orange, 12 Monkeys, Mars Attacks and Apocalypse Now).

However, there have been plenty of restrictions in this version of Duke 3D. Nintendo have replaced some areas (the porn mag shop has turned into a gun store, the bar is now a burger joint, and the nude women aren't nude anymore), and there is an option available to turn the blood off.

A 4 player mode has also been included, where you can take on your mates as well as Duke Bots, and a 2 player co-op mode, so two players can tackle the single player missions.</desc>

There are several game modes to choose from. First, there is a season mode with multiple skill levels. Completing a 5-race season in first place unlocks special tracks and more difficult classes. Second, there is a exhibition mode which allows you and up to 3 other people to choose a single track to race on. Third, there is a time trial mode in which you try to get the best times on the 20 tracks.

Finally. there are multiple special tracks. Some of the special tracks include a point-to-point race through the desert, a hill-climb competition, motocross soccer, and a pixel-perfect conversion of the original Excitebike.

    <desc>The sequel to Fighters Destiny (the title now without the s in 'Fighters') has you again taking your created fighter up the ranks by competing in a number of challenging 1 on 1 battles.

As with the first title, the aim is to hit a number of targets on the opposition's body to gain points, as well as knockouts, ring-outs, time expiry and so forth. In total there are over 30 moves to be used. The winner is the one with the most points at the end, which will not necessarily be the one with the most energy left.</desc>

    <desc>Take a collection of fist-fighters, wrestlers and martial arts experts, and combine them into one tournament. But instead of relying on simply depleting the health bar, you must win points depending on how you defeat an opponent (for example, ring-outs are 1 point, special moves 4 points and countering a special move is 2 points). 

Game modes include the standard VS. mode, simply defeat everyone you see. VS. Battle allows you to defeat the enemy, then acquire their moves for the next round. The Master Challenge has you spinning a wheel to determine who your fight. Spin up a Master, and you get a tough challenge in which you can win new moves. Spin a Joker, and you simply have a challenge, with nothing to gain, but everything to lose.</desc>

    <desc>Flying Dragon is a side-view battle game reminiscent of 16-bit titles. It features eight characters to choose from with two main modes of play, "SD" (super deformed) and "Virtual" (ala 'Virtua Fighter' style).

SD mode is sort of RPG'ish with treasures you gain from winning battles and becoming a stronger fighter. it has the usual circuit, tournament and practice modes plus a 'treasure box' where you check your existing items, buy new items or trade items you already have for something else.

Virtual mode is the more familiar format of a battle game with game modes such as circuit, tournament and practice. It also has 2D and 3D "rules" for how the game is played. 2D is 16-bit arcade style and 3D is more realistic.</desc>

    <desc>Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge is a video game released in 2000. The game is part of the Frogger series, and the sequel to the 1997 remake of Frogger, featuring similar 4-way movement gameplay in a 3D world and 6 different environments. Unlike its predecessor, Frogger 2 featured a choice of different characters to play with in the game, several multiplayer modes, and an in-game storyline. A Nintendo 64 port of the game was planned, but it was cancelled. 
 
The sequel to the Original classic (and the so-so 1997 release) changes the way you look at frogs! The stage is set for a totally new adventure where Frogger and his female friend Lillie Frog will need to leap over, dive under, hop through and climb above endless new obstacles and challenges to save the Frog Babies from Frogger's new arch enemy, the dastardly Swampy the Crocodile.</desc>

    <name>F-Zero X - Weilai Saiche    </name>
    <desc>Famed SNES racer F-Zero got this N64 update. Gameplay remains essentially unchanged, race in a futuristic racing tournament on tracks levitated miles up in the air, against a selection of devious opponents.

Where the original had 4 cars to choose from and race against, F-Zero X has no fewer than 30 vehicles all with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, a choice of colours, and customisable power/acceleration ratios for each track. At the beginning you are limited to choosing from 6 cars and 3 tournaments (each featuring 6 tracks each), but in true Nintendo fashion, more cars and tracks are unlocked as you progress through the game. As well as the cups, you can also race in time trial mode, against a 'ghost car' recording of your best previous lap, a lá Mario Kart 64.

Gone are the entirely flat tracks of the original, having been replaced with tracks that twist, turn, loop, rotate and basically contort into the most crazy shapes you could imagine. One unique feature amongst almost all other racing games is the "X" tournament, where courses are totally randomly generated each time you start.

One of the most important changes to the format is the inclusion of multiplayer support for up to 4 players. The various combat moves are especially important against aggressive human play.

This game has a  rock soundtrack, which I believe is the first game soundtrack ever to feature the bestial grunting found only in death metal music.</desc>

However, Skorne crushed Garm and imprisoned his soul in the Underworld. Skorne, fearing the power of the Runestones, scattered them throughout the four realms, so that they could never be used against him. The player(s) must defeat the end bosses of each of the four realms to obtain the four golden keys which allow access to Skorne's temple. While traveling through each realm, he/she/they must also collect the Thirteen Runestones from where they have been scattered. The complete set of Runestones allows him/her/them to pursue Skorne to the Underworld in order to finally destroy him. The players must find 3 rune stones on each kingdom in order to defeat Skorne in the Underworld, and of course 1 from the battle grounds.</desc>

All Ebisumaru wanted to do with it was meet his ancestor, James Dean!  Help Goemon and his friends retrieve the Machine, and bust some ghosts on the way.

Mystical Ninja 2 reverts back to the traditional side-scrolling 2D platforming style of the SNES games.  However, due to to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities, you'll encounter massive bosses and detailed worlds as you make your way through Japan.  To attack, you can either hurl coins, or use each character's specific weapon, such as Goemon's trademark pipe.  Two players can also play simultaneously and work together to beat foes, and you can even ride piggy-back onto your friend.

There are also towns to explore, where you chat with villagers and explore various shops and houses for information and clues.  Goemon Impact, the giant singing robot wearing rollerskates, also makes a return as you battle enemy mechs from inside its cockpit in a first-person view.</desc>

    <desc>The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming's novels returns in this first-person shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.

Ten years later, a mysterious organization named "Janus" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called "GoldenEye", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.

In this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you'll have to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.</desc>

    <desc>GT 64, short for Grand Tour 64, is a 3D racing game for the Nintendo 64. It features cars and drivers from the All-Japan GT Championship season of 1997 as it is an officially licensed game.

    <name>Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine </name>
    <desc>The year is 1947. Dr. Jones Jr is on a retirement from adventuring, living the life of a scholar and an archaeologist. But soon he meets his old flame ...and new enemies. Soviets are tracking parts of a mysterious, powerful machine from ancient Babylon, hoping to use it as a weapon. They must be stopped from unleashing unspeakable danger from another world.

Are you ready to lead Indy into adventures in lost temples, under mountains and through unexplored mines, for tales of missing artifacts, snake encounters and other things?

Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine combined action and adventure in a way the older Indy games did not do. The gameplay is inspired by Tomb Raider, as Indy moves through 3D representations of 17 locations around the world. The game engine is modified from Jedi Knight.

Puzzles based around switches &amp; items; precise jumping must be negotiated on regular basis. You must use ladders, ropes and dinghies as well as moving on foot. You will also find yourself aboard a jeep and a mine cart. Replacements for your standard whip can be collected en route (from Soviet army arsenal), including grenades, sub-machine guns and bazookas. The valuable treasures you find can be used to buy extra ammo (between the levels). After each level you get your score (Indy Quotient) - you must reach all the treasure items cleverly hidden in secret places to get all the points.</desc>

    <name>Jet Force Gemini </name>
    <desc>Twins Juno and Vela, and their dog Lupus, are Jet Force Gemini, intergalactic police.  Their mission?  Stop the evil space bug, Mizar, from his goal of galactic conquest with his seemingly-infinite army of Drones.  They'll have to stop along multiple planets along the way, and assisting King Jeff and rescuing his subjects, the Tribals.

Jet Force Gemini is a third-person shooter which revels in making gigantic creepy bugs explode into dribbly mucousy bits.  The Jet Force team are given progressively more powerful weapons, from the Machine Gun, which rips through both enemies and ammo, the Plasma Shotgun, which you can charge up for some explosive fireworks, and the Tri-Rocket Launcher, which fires three rockets with every shot, sending explosive doom in the direction of your target.  There's also the Fish Food, which is used to...er, feed fish.  Really.

Even though they're called Drones, these bugs aren't stupid.  When encountered, they'll rush you, hide behind objects for cover, and even run off for reinforcements when you confront them.  They also take delight in shooting the innocent Tribals, whom you are supposed to be rescuing.  But the Drones are nothing compared to the game's insanely difficult bosses, which includes a pair of gigantic praying mantis, a huge beetle, and of course, Mizar himself, to name but a few.

Each of their team has their own special abilities - Juno can walk through lava without any trouble, Vela can swim underwater, and Lupus can hover for short distances and travel through tight spaces.  These abilities are required to fully access areas that they previously couldn't reach.  The team also get the help of Floyd the Droid, a hovering robot that can be controlled by player two as a floating gun with infinite ammo when he joins your team.

The game also includes three different multiplayer modes: Battle - featuring most options of an average First Person Shooter but with a third-person perspective, Target Shoot - a shooting gallery with a first-person view, and Racing, which includes some kart-like racing as well as old-school top down racing games.</desc>

Unable to use the full fleet on the Emperor's defenses, which would cause mass casualties, they decide that a lone Lod Runner should enter the enemy base to recover any gold found and destroy the Emperor.

From an isometric style perspective, you must guide Lode Runner through each of the levels, dodging defensive blocks and enemies by either placing bombs and blowing holes in the ground to finding another way around. By finding all of the gold on the level, you can then progress to the next level.</desc>

    <name>Mario Kart 64 </name>
    <desc>Mario Kart 64 races eight familiar faces, including Mario, Bowser and Yoshi, on four progressively tougher four-track circuits. Wide curves and gentle banks mark the Mushroom Cup tracks. Your commute gets notably tougher on the Flower Cup, though. The player will have to dodge semis rumbling on Toad's Turnpike and bounding boulders on fogbound Choco Mountain! Star Cup tracks range from the icy surfaces of Sherbet Land to the lava lakes of Bowser's Castle. The true test of karting competence, though, comes on the four tracks in Special Cup. Zip through the dark caves and green hillsides of Donkey Kong's Jungle Parkway, cling to the sheer cliffs of Yoshi Valley and hustle over haunted Banshee Boardwalk before tackling the longest track in the game: neon-lit Rainbow Road. 

The game offers two camera angles and three engine sizes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. You can gain even more speed by mastering the power slide technique or grabbing Super Star power-ups. Each kart has distinctive handling, acceleration and top speed capabilities. Light karts like Princess's smoothly steer through tight corners, but run the constant risk of getting flattened by heavy karts, like Donkey Kong's. Shells that you fire at rival racers, Bananas that make them skid out and Lightning Bolts that make them small and very slow are just a few of the game's unique power-ups.</desc>

    <name>Mario Party </name>
    <desc>You know Mario can jump. You know he can kick Bowser's tail from here to the moon, but we bet you didn't realize that Mario is the biggest party animal on the face of the Earth. Nintendo is throwing the most insane bash to ever hit the N64, and you're invited. For the first time, you'll catch a glimpse of how Mario celebrates all of the victories he's had over the years. 

Mario Party is unlike any other game for the N64, and it just might be the best party game to ever hit the system. Mario Party is designed for 1 to 4 players, but it's not really a party unless you're playing with your pals. The festivities are based on a board game format, right down to the fact that players must roll a die to determine how many spaces to move. The fun starts when players land on different squares, because each space holds one of more than fifty different mini-games. These quick competitions determine who will earn coins and stars, and who will go home empty handed. 

 The mini-games are spread over eight different game boards, all of which are not immediately available. Some of the games pit every man or princess against the others, some are two-on-two, and others are even three against one. The games are simple, but remarkably fun to play. One challenge is loosely based on "Simon Says," another involves a two-on-two bobsled race, and one crazy game makes one player attempt to cross a rope while the other three do their best to shake the player off. You'll find skill games, racing games, puzzle games --basically any type of challenge you could imagine. 

A good portion of the actual game boards are animated, with hidden dangers and special challenges scattered everywhere. Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser, Yoshi, and Wario are all invited to the party, and each character has his or her own game board. 

Mario Party is fun for only one player, but to get the most out of this party-in-a-pak, you should play with three other friends. It's definitely the kind of game that will keep you up till the wee hours of the morning, so you might want to start catching up on your sleep right away.</desc>

The second edition includes 5 new boards, each with a specific theme, such as Space Land, Western Land, Horror Land, and Mystery Land. Each board includes unique attributes in relation to the theme, but the main goal is the same: complete the board game over a certain amount of moves and be the player to have the most coins and/or stars at the end. 

The single player story mode allows one person and 3 CPU controlled players to play each board. Once you play a specific mini-game (64 in all), they become available to purchase using the coins you collected in your games to play anytime. Multiplayer allows 2 to 4 people to play the game.</desc>

In Battle Royale mode (four player), you race around different boards to earn the most stars and coins.  At the end of each round, you face it off in one of the mini-games, which can be chicken chases, snowball fights, or various other competitions.

Duel mode allows play between just two people.  You still race around the board, but mini-games are only played when you land on a specific square.  Another play change is the addition of another character for your team, allowing tag team-style action in the game.

Story mode is essentially the same as a Battle Royale, except your opponents are played by the computer.</desc>

    <desc>The Weasels have kidnapped Pluto while he was wearing his diamond collar!  All that was left of him was a ransom note showing the Weasels driving him away in a van.  Mickey rounds up all of his friends (and even Pete wants to get in on the action!), and Professor Von Drake soups up their race cars so that they can catch up with the Weasels as they go on a cross-country tour of the United States.  The Weasels have also stolen four parts of the Professor's top-secret racer, and hidden them in four of the tracks.  Once players find all these pieces, they can catch up with the Weasels in the final showdown.

Mickey's Speedway USA is a kart racer from Rare based on the Diddy Kong Racing game engine.  Players compete in circuits of four races, grand prix style, and the player with the most points at the end of all four races wins the gold trophy.  There are six initial racers, but only three sets of stats shared between them.  Minnie and Daisy are lightweight and good for beginners, Mickey and Donald are both all-around characters, while Pete and Goofy are the slow but fast heavyweights.

The game has an assortment of pickups - there's the Carbo Spritzer, a soda-powered turbo; the Paint Splotcher, which launches a slippery blob of paint onto the track; the Baseball Chucker, which launches an explosive baseball onto the track; and the Magno Flyer, which sends a remote control plane to seek the nearest opponent, to name a few.  There are also 'Oomph Tokens' scattered on the track - the first ten of these tokens increase your racer's maximum speed a little.

As well as the main game, Mickey's Speedway USA also features a Time Trial mode (where you race against the clock), a Practice mode (where you can drive all around a farmyard course to practice your skills), and Contest mode (which functions like the famous Battle Mode in Mario Kart 64 - players must pop their opponents' three balloons before they lose all of their own).  The game is also Transfer Pak compatible with the Game Boy Color version of Mickey's Speedway USA.</desc>

    <name>Mortal Kombat Mythologies - Sub-Zero </name>
    <desc>In a surprising twist of fate, Midway made a Mortal Kombat game that focuses on perhaps the series strongest point when compared to other fighting games: it's storyline. The game casts you in the shoes of Sub-Zero, and chronicles a series of events that ocurred prior to Mortal Kombat 1.

In a storyline that is reminiscent of Looking Glass's Thief, the Lin Kuei assassin/thief is sent to steal an important document; this mission proves to be a test from a mysterious character (which turns out to be MK4's Quan Chi) and who charges you upon retrieval of this object to recover an ancient medallion of untold power. However once you retrieve the medallion, Quan Chi reveals that he actually tricked you, and the medallion is the key to awakening the demonic Shinnok (yup, the same baddie from MK4). You must now become a reluctant hero, as you pursue Quan Chi trough hell itself hoping you get to Shinnok before him.

Gameplay wise the game takes the Mortal Kombat familiar 2D fighting enviroment and turns it into a hybrid fighter/platformer game, where you must travel trough hazardous levels running and jumping around as well as fighting your way against both digitized and polygonal enemies. Sub-Zero's interface is the same as in every MK game, with the addition of a "use" and "turn around" buttons and additions such as an inventory, and a slight rpg twist in which you get exp. for defeating opponents, which translates into new techniques and moves to execute in the game.

Technically speaking this game represents the final evolutionary step in the MK's series 2D engines. New features include zooming, 3d lighting as well as 3d backgrounds and characters, etc.</desc>

    <desc>The people of Oedo Town are in a panic!  A gigantic UFO shaped like a peach has arrived, and the Peach Mountain Shoguns have turned Oedo Castle into one big stage for themselves to perform on!  Everyone's relying on Goemon to save the day, but he hasn't even noticed what's happening!  Can our hero stop the Shoguns before they do any more damage?

Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon is an action-based RPG similar in style to The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time.  It is also the first localized Goemon game since The Legend of the Mystical Ninja for the SNES.  Players control Goemon and his friends as they make their way through Ancient Japan to stop the Peach Mountain Shoguns.  You can talk to characters, whack enemies with your pipe (or hurl coins at them), visit a deranged fortune teller who shrieks out "PLASMA!" at random intervals for no reason, and more.

Each member of the Goemon team can also learn a special ability to access new areas as players progress through the game.  Goemon earns the "Sudden Impact" power, which lets him move blocks he normally couldn't, Ebisumaru can shrink to small sizes so he can pass through tiny cracks, Sasuke earns an extra high jump, and Yae gets the ability to transform into a Mermaid so that she can swim underwater.

As usual, the gigantic roller-skating robot, Impact, makes an appearance.  Players get to use him to trample down buildings and duke it out in first-person mode against gigantic mecha boss characters in a Punch-Out!! style game.</desc>

Like its predecessors in the long-running  series, NBA Live 2000 strives for realistic basketball simulation rather than arcade-like gameplay. New moves have been added in this installments, and opponent AI has been tweaked to make victory more dependent on executing the right moves at the right times. As in the previous NBA Live games, it is possible to edit and create basketball players, as well as create and build an own team. This time, it is also possible to use any picture to serve as a player photo.

New to this installment (beside Jordan) is a one-on-one street basketball mode, and a mode that allows management of a team for several seasons, including trading players.</desc>

In Story Mode you take control of bio-mechanical mechas called Evas to fight against monstrous beings called Angels. To see every mission through, combo attacks (punches and kicks), blocking and grappling techniques are available at your disposal. Depending on the damage the Eva you control takes and if certain parameters are met during that time you will be given a time limit in which you must end the battle with the Angel. 

The Simulation Mode: almost plays like a shooter. It’s a 1st-person perspective mode where you must eliminate as many Angels as possible within the time limit. When the time limit ends you get a rank depending on how many enemies you destroyed and how many bullets you used.</desc>

    <name>NHL 99 </name>
    <desc>After the award-winning NHL 98, EA worked to improve what was considered to be one the most complete ice hockey games in the market. Along the usual and almost obligatory NHL roster updates, the International mode first featured in the previous version was expanded, allowing players to choose IIHF rules and rink size.

Graphically, the arena is more detailed with more rinkside features, and ice reflections, player faces were improved and stand more seamlessly into the model, enhanced motion capture result in better animated hits (with the ability to break the glass with a well-placed body check making a return), shots and saves, and finally an higher polygon count complete the graphic enhancements to the game.

As graphic changes aren't enough to make a game better, gameplay was also tweaked, with computer players being smarter, both in offense and defense. Shooting was tweaked (slap shots are easier to pull, players no longer skate in circles to do some backhand shots and must be facing the goal to shoot, particularly in one timers) and a new special move brings dekes, spin-o-ramas and the kind of moves Jagr, Fedorov and Selänne pull when one-on-one with the goalie. However, if the player gets too close to the crease, the referee might want to review the play in the new video goal judge, so the player must think twice before trying to pull a "Brett Hull". For newcomers to the sport, a new Beginner mode allows players to get used to the ice without having to concern with penalties or an overly strong opponent.

The season mode was also improved, with the players now having streaks that affect either positively or negatively his abilities. Debuting the Nashville Predators, players can either choose to play with their initial roster, or do a fantasy expansion draft.

Like in the previous year, Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh liven up matches with play by play and colour commentary.</desc>

    <desc>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley.

Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</desc>

    <name>Off Road Challenge </name>
    <desc>Off Road Challenge is an off-road truck racing game for the Nintendo 64.  Like Cruis'n USA, it was also an arcade game ported over to the N64.  Gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Super Off Road: The Baja.  The player races against other off-road vehicles across various landscapes, while collecting nitros and gold along the way.  Gold picked up on the course or earned from racing can be used to upgrade the vehicle.  Once the player has completed the circuit, they move up to the next difficulty level and go through it again, keeping the upgraded truck.</desc>

    <name>Penny Racers </name>
    <desc>Penny Racers is a racing game with cartoonish, made-of-paper-like cars. There are thirteen cars which you can choose from and nine tracks in total – all available right from the start. It features two playable modes, Race Series and Time Trial, and a mode that allows you to create your own track. The game also supports up to four human players. 

In Race Series you can select one of the thirteen cars and race in any of the nine tracks with five more competitors. You can only compete in Class C (lower difficulty) races at first but can unlock more if you finish within the first three positions. At the beginning of each race you are given the option to customize your car’s parts – parts like the car’s body, engine, tires, etc. – but only if you have more than one in stock for each category. New parts can be taken from the other cars at the end of each race but only if you are among the first three racers that cross the finish line. Also, each part has points and the sum of these points must not exceed the point limit for each difficulty. For example a basic brake part may add one point to the total sum (better parts add more points). If with all the other parts the sum of points exceeds a lets say point limit of six then you are not allowed to enter the race. The current mode supports up to two human players.

Time Trial is the basic mode where you run against time. You can also load a previously saved ghost to race against.

VS Race mode can be accessed only if three or four human players are selected. It has 8 tracks that are different from the ones of the other modes and these tracks have more obstacles. 

New Track lets you create your own custom made track. You can select the road type (on road/off road) and track type (circuit/stage). After the basic layout is selected you are taken on the “map” where you can choose from the available layers to make the track. You can also adjust the road’s height.</desc>

    <desc>Joanna Dark is an agent for the Carrington Institute, a secret organization funded by anonymous sources and dedicated to protecting the world.  Through their highly trained operatives and special devices (gadgets), Carrington keeps an eye on terrorists, world powers, and strange happenings. The speed in which the dataDyne corporation has established itself through the development of new technologies is starting to worry the institute. So when Carrington receives a message from Dr. Caroll, a scientist wishing to escape dataDyne, they send their best agent, Joanna, to infiltrate the company headquarters...

Perfect Dark is a first person game similar to Rare's earlier Goldeneye: 007 though with more of an emphasis on stealth. Joanna can pick up and use a variety of firearms.  In addition she carries quite a few spy gadgets such as IR scanners, night vision, probes, and a deadly laptop.

The Xbox 360 port has redone graphics to support a 1080p full HD resolution at 60 frames per second. It also incorporates full multiplayer support over Xbox LIVE.</desc>

    <path>./Quake (USA).zip</path>
    <name>Quake </name>
    <desc>An enemy with the codename ''Quake'', which is believed to come from another dimension, is using teleporter gates to invade Earth. The player takes the role of a nameless soldier who arrives at his base only to find out Quake has overrun it and killed everyone. Somewhere in the base there must be a teleporter to Quake's realm. The mission is clear: take the fight to the enemy, overcoming countless hordes of monsters, and exact revenge.

id Software's followup to Doom and Doom II, "Quake" is a first-person shooter. Its main technological innovation is the use of a true 3D engine - the levels themselves as well as the enemies are polygonal. This not only allows for more natural level designs and character animations, but also for more realistic lighting and the inclusion of simulated physics that have an effect on gameplay: grenades can bounce off walls and around corners, for example.

In single-player mode, gameplay consists mainly of proceeding through the levels (spread over four distinct episodes) in search of an exit, killing everything that moves. Interaction with the game world is reduced to a minimum: since there is no use key, buttons are pressed by running into or shooting at them. As in id's earlier games, many secrets are waiting to be discovered, including a few hidden levels.

Unlike Doom's rather straightforward design that couples futuristic environments with demonic imagery, the theme of Quake's levels, enemies and weapons is not so easily pinpointed. While each episode begins in a futuristic military base (with a technological 'slipgate' as the level exit), later levels take place in environments inspired by medieval fantasy and gothic horror (castles, dungeons and caverns) and the player passes through magical portals to advance. In a departure from Doom's colorful environments, all Quake levels are dominated by earth colors.

The enemies conform to the mishmash of designs: there are human opponents armed with shotguns and energy weapons in the early levels, while the later levels include medieval knights, ghosts, zombies, ogres (armed with grenade launchers and chainsaws) and some more unearthly beasts. The player's weapons, while relatively modern, all have a low-tech feel.  Besides a (bloodstained) axe, there are shotguns, nailguns, rocket and grenade launchers and the Thunderbolt, which discharges electrical energy.

Quake was one of the first games playable natively over the Internet in addition to LANs. The single-player levels can be played cooperatively, but the game is most famous for its deathmatch mode. One-on-one duels, team play and free-for-all competition are possible. The emphasis is on fast reaction and skillful maneuvering through the levels. All of the single-player maps can be used as arenas, but the game also comes with six maps especially designed for deathmatch.</desc>

Each difficulty setting has 3 races and the place you manage to get at the end of each race is carried on to the next one. Car damage does not apply in this mode. 

2. Championship - you race in a total of 9 rounds with 3 laps per round. In each round you get points depending on what position you finished in and in the end these points are accumulated to decide your final ranking. In this mode you can see the damage inflicted on the car, not on the car itself but on an icon on the left part of the screen. Effects from the damage include lesser top speed, slower acceleration and bad steering. It is also possible to customize certain options like tires, steering, etc., to get the best possible performance depending on the weather condition on each course.

3. Practice - mode where you can learn the controls and get acquainted with the various courses of the game.

4. Vs Race - allows up to 4 players to play simultaneously in any of the game’s courses.</desc>

    <name>Razor Freestyle Scooter </name>
    <desc>Razor Freestyle Scooter is an extreme-sports style action game modeled around small, nimble scooters.  In contrast to most games of this type, there is a story.  A crazed giant robot has kidnapped your skating buddies.  By completing skating challenges at the robot's sky fortress, you must rescue your friends.

You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control.

Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.</desc>

    <name>Re-Volt </name>
    <desc>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! 

Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. 

There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. 

In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</desc>

    <desc>The retro shooter returns with the same addictive gameplay of the original arcade game, but now with the added power of the Nintendo 64.

The aim of the game is simple. Shoot all the enemies on each grid while saving the humans from certain death. Power-ups and items can be picked up to increase your shooting and speed ability, and the further you go in the game, the more enemies attack and the more difficult it gets to save the humans.

Options include the ability to plug in a second N64 controller for added control of the character on the game screen (i.e. two analog sticks). The brand new 3D engine, while sporting similar styled graphics that hark back to the 80's classic, also boasts fuller textures and greater mobility for the character.</desc>

In Angelica's Temple of Gloom you have to beat Angelica in reaching various pieces of an Aztec statue. The Pirate Treasure hunt requires the Rugrats to travel underwater to find buried treasure. The Reptar Rally lets them collect candy on Candy Island.

The game can be played with up to four players (or NPC players). each turn you can move as many paces as you got on the spinner (a replacement for dice). Some tiles have special actions attached to them that let you move further or gain or lose cookies. Each Rugrat also has limited energy, when they move a lot they get tired and have to take a nap to regain energy. You can collect Toy Cards to open doors or use against friends to gain an edge.</desc>

    <name>Snowboard Kids </name>
    <desc>A racing game where you control one of five cutesy snowboarders competing against each other. Being a snowboarding game, each track is a downhill slalom with a ski lift at the bottom which takes you back to the start for however many laps a track has.

The tracks are varied, the first few taking place on snowy mountainsides, while the latter taking you to wackier locales such as grassy countryside, a desert and a theme park. The money collected on the course or won at the end of the race can be spent to buy better boards, which differ in stats, or to collect items/weapons while racing. There are also stunts that can be performed while racing which earn money as well, and certain parts of each course encourage the player to do so.

Other modes include stunt mode, shoot mode and speed mode, all focusing on a particular part of the gameplay from the main game, and a multiplayer mode where up to 4 players can race each other. There are also unlockables for dedicated players.</desc>

    <name>Snowboard Kids 2 </name>
    <desc>The Sequel to the famous snowboard simulation Snowboard Kids is a fun family sports game. It combines a trick-oriented snowboard simulator with shooting/arcade elements. 

Player can choose from various characters with different look and skills. There are different gaming modes, including a story mode with very light and entertaining plot. The storyline is actually quite basic, sometimes similar to the Kirby series concepts. Hence, there is no rush for saving the world, just some funny little fellas entertaining themselves. 

Winning a race or performing tricks provides the player with some credit which can be spent on improved equipment. Shooting elements are based on but not limited to throwing strange objects (like parachutes or snow-men) against other snowboard kids in order to slow them down. There are great power-ups during the gameplay. Courses are rarely covered with snow - most of the races are held in freakish regions like jungles, space stations, castles etc.</desc>

    <path>./Space Invaders (USA).zip</path>
    <name>Space Invaders </name>
    <desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

    <name>SpaceStation Silicon Valley  </name>
    <desc>Long ago, scientists created a living space station, full of animals. After its launch into space, the station vanished, never to be seen again.

Until now.

The station has reappeared out of no-where, many years after its first launch, and is on a collision course with Earth. Two unlikely heroes (pilot and all-round ugly looking guy Dan and robot Evo) are now thrust with the mission to stop the station, and find out where it has been all this time.

Sadly, not everything goes to plan, with their ship crashing into the station. Evo, the unlucky robot that he is, is thrown out of the ship and smashed into pieces. His only hope for survival is to attach his microchip into another host robot. Thankfully, underneath the wrecked ship is the remains of another robot, and with a quick fix Evo is now a robotic dog.

As you enter the valley, you must contend with a host of other robots much like the dog, of all shapes and animal sizes. You can move Evo's chip from one animal to another to gain attributes and abilities, improving your chance of success to get past the killer penguins and rocket launching tigers.

Aims of the game include the basic destruction of enemy robots, to sheep herding, controlling Evo the rat through a mini maze, and plenty more through 35 levels of insane 3rd person action.

When the game was ported to PlayStation some of the bugs from the Nintendo 64 version were fixed.</desc>

    <path>./Spider-Man (USA).zip</path>
    <name>Spider-Man </name>
    <desc>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.

Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.

This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.

Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.

Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.

Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.

There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</desc>

    <name>StarCraft 64 </name>
    <desc>In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the edge of the galaxy. Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace. But as resources and fuel run short, the Confederate nations find themselves looking towards the rich worlds of their alien neighbors, the enigmatic Protoss. To further complicate matters, it seems that a previously unknown species-- the Zerg-- has entered Protoss space and is destroying everything in its path. The time for war has come.

The N64 port of StarCraft is a real-time strategy game featuring three distinct races - Terrans, Protoss and Zerg. Controls have been adjusted for the gamepad, with several Hot-Key menus available, and resource gathering has been automated to limit the required number of options. However, it lacks the cutscenes and map editor of the original game.

If the player has the Expansion Pack for the N64, the entire Brood Wars expansion is also available. One player can play with up to 7 bots on a random map, or 2 players can team up in co-operative mode (with the N64 Expansion Pack) or go head to head with up to 6 other bots for total mayhem.</desc>

    <desc>This futuristic racer has you flying along specially built tracks, jumping through rings, pulling off aerial stunts and getting up to insane speeds.

The main aim of the game, as with all racers, is to get to the finish line first. But by getting some air and landing through rings, or pulling off stunts, you'll also pick up coins that will go towards upgrading your car.

The cars themselves are a mix of the future and the past, with a hot rod style outside with a powerful new age engine inside. That power will go towards getting you over the line, with the use of speed boosts as well as shortcuts on the tracks helping you greatly.

A 4 player split screen mode is also included, while you can compete in practice, quick race and the competitive League mode, as well as stunt modes that will test your stunt making skills on half pipes and large open tracks.</desc>

    <desc>Super Smash Brothers takes familiar Nintendo characters such as Mario, Kirby and Donkey Kong, and puts them into battle! There are 8 fully-interactive landscapes, with one for each character and noticeable links to their games. Controls are analogue-based, with different moves executed depending on the direction and how firmly the stick is pressed. Items like baseball bats, Bob-ombs, and healing items drop into the arenas at random, aiding any nearby characters than can make use of them. The game uses a fixed viewpoint which scrolls, although characters are rendered in 3D. 
 
The one-player mode has 14 stages to work through. Up to 4 human players can do battle at once, with team play as well as all-against-all action. Hidden characters are thrown in for good measure, as are bonus rounds, and a battle to the end with a giant hand (yeah, you read right!). 
 
Playable characters include: Captain Falcon* (F-Zero), Donkey Kong, Fox (Star Fox), Kirby, Jigglypuff* (Pokémon), Link (Legend of Zelda), Luigi* (Mario), Mario, Ness* (Mother/EarthBound), Pikachu (Pokémon), Samus (Metroid) and Yoshi (Mario)

Tigger's Honey Hunt is a platform action game in which the player guides Tigger through nine levels. In six levels the goal is to collect a predetermined minimum amount of honey pots in order to get access to the next level. In the other three levels there are  mini-games like Rock-Paper-Scissors, to play against other characters from Winnie the Pooh's world.

Tigger is able to jump horizontally and vertically (even higher after he has learned special skills), use spider webs to jump to higher areas or to cross water or chasms with the help of turtles or levitating leaves. Beginning with three lives, Tigger needs to avoid being touched by dangerous creatures like bees or falling into chasms. When there are no lives left, Tigger restarts at the last checkpoint that has been passed.

Additionally you can find secret areas with even more honey pots, collect pictures which you can later look at in your photo album and meet other characters who talk to you or need your help (e.g. finding Eeyore's lost tail).</desc>

There are nine real life pro skaters you can choose to play as, including Tony Hawk himself.  Each skater has their own signature moves that earn you big points if pulled off successfully.</desc>

    <desc>Tony Hawk returns with an all new line-up of skaters, an all new line-up of parks to crash through, and a whole new level of graphics.

The line-up of street and vert riders include Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Steve Caballero, Rune Glifberg, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Eric Koston, Chad Muska, Bucky Lasek and Bam Margera from MTV's Jackass (and Tony Hawk, of course).

The create a skater mode returns, allowing for even further levels of options for your character, like adding glasses and tatoos to changing the colour of the knee and elbow pads or even the hair.

And the levels themselves that you must skate through are now more interactive, with cars and humans blocking paths and making noise as you race around to make as many points as possible. Use items around the streets or the park to jump from or over to increase your score, and pull of as many wild and wacky tricks as you can.</desc>

    <name>Top Gear Rally 2 </name>
    <desc>The second rally racer from Kemco on the N64 provides a vastly different style of rally racing to the original Top Gear Rally.

Along with the new option to join a rally racing team, who supports you through-out each championship cup you take part in. Money raised by each vistory or top place in the cups goes towards improving your car, or reparing any problems. If you take a wrong turn and damage a part of your car (which can be anything from tyres to a full engine), the repairs come out of your pocket, so driving carefully is important.
New sponsership deals and bigger team call ups will also come into play the better you race, allowing the chance to drive the more powerful rally cars and play for big money.

Much like the real rally championship, you don't race against other cars in the cups. Instead, you must race the clock. Whoever clocks the best time for each stage will win the points and move on to the next stage and the bigger cup challenges.

You can also take part in the usual arcade rally style against 4 other cars, with the first to get to the finish taking the points. 2 players can play as part of one team during a championship campaign, as well up to four players split screen in the arcade mode.</desc>

    <name>Viewpoint 2064</name>
    <desc>Viewpoint 2064 was a 3D vertical shmup being developed by Racdym to be published by the series owners Sammy Corporation. It was a sequel to the original Viewpoint which released in 1992.

Viewpoint 2064’s first known announcement was in August 1999, when Nintendo announced their Space World August 1999 lineup. The game was playable at both Space World and the September 1999 Tokyo Game Show. In Nintendo’s Space World guide book, it was given a half page advertisement and was listed as 100% complete, set for a November 11th, 1999 release date for ¥7,800.

When IGN64 did their Space World 1999 coverage, on August 27th, 1999, they reported that Sammy was in talks with several International publishers, but that no US release date was currently planned. Despite being listed as 100% complete Viewpoint 2064 was not simply delayed to Q1 2000, but disappeared completely soon after the show with some magazines and websites stating it had been canned. However, a year later on August 14th, 2000, IGN reported that Viewpoint 2064 was scheduled to appear at the upcoming Tokyo Game Show and was set for a November 24th release date. It was listed on the organisation’s Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) website, also with a release date of November 24th, 2000, for a then undecided price.

Meanwhile, Tsutaya, a chain of book and video rental stores, posted Viewpoint 2064 for sale on their website. This listing had a release date of November 17th, 2000, some preliminary box art, and a description of the game. All this information makes it likely that other retailers had been informed about the upcoming release as well, but Viewpoint 2064 did not hit this date, and by 2001 the game had been quietly cancelled.

Out of all of the versions of Viewpoint that were released, Viewpoint 2064 was the only one that was developed as a true sequel, with entirely different levels, mechanics, graphics, progression, and a story. 

No official reason for cancellation was given.</desc>

    <desc>Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.

Choose from 8 characters with different endings with cars
ranging to classic 70's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3 hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it's at. The PSX version allows 2 players, while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.</desc>

The graphics in War Gods are fairly unique. They were created by texture-mapping 3D character models with digitized photos of people.  This gives them a reasonably lifelike look.</desc>

    <desc>The idea for this game is that you must build barriers on the arena to stop the water from leaking out. As you go along, rain starts to fall onto the arena, so you better keep the walls as high as possible. Too much on the screen, though, will start and earthquake. Ice blocks fall to freeze the water. Bombs drop, leaving holes in your walls and fireballs dry up the water. Simply go as long as possible to get as high a score as you can. There is a practice mode available, and you can play against a friend.</desc>

WO64 is essentially WipeOut XL 2 (or occasionally dubbed WipeOut XXL) in that most aspects of the game are the same as XL. Same selection of ships, same handling system but using the analog control stick instead of the d-pad, even similar graphics. Don't think for a minute with all the similarities, that this is the same game by any means though...

1. Piranha is now capable of using weapons
2. Each team has a special weapon of their own
Completely new tracks
3. Graphics are infinitely smoother, more detailed as well
4. AI has improved
5. New music, primarily by a new Psygnosis in-house, "PC Music", but two additional songs by Fluke, and one by Propellerheads
6. 2, 3, or 4 player ability
7. No more league mode, but Challenges instead: Race, Time Trial, Weapon, and Super Combo Challenge</desc>

    <name>Worms Armageddon  </name>
    <desc>The final sequel (at least using the present engine) to the strategy game Worms, Worms Armageddon expands on Worms 2 by improving quite a few facets of gameplay and including play over the Internet through Team 17's WORMNET. 

For those who've never played Worms, it's at heart similar to the old game Artillery, which you control an artillery piece. In essence, you give it a shot angle and shot power, and try to hit your enemy, despite wind effects and the enemy firing back at you. Worms puts you in command of a team of Worms, but not only can you move around the landscape, you can use many types of weapons to try to dispatch the enemy, from bazookas to mini-guns to exploding sheep. 

Everything is presented in a humorous cartoonish style, from the landscapes to the worms themselves and their cries of triumph or despair, depending on how you do.

Armageddon uses an enhanced version of the Worms 2 engine, and while an improvement over Worms 2, it's not a huge change.</desc>

    <desc>Loosely based on the Super NES classic Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story follows the adventures of six Yoshis as they search through sunny woods, dark caves, soaring mountains, steaming jungles, vast oceans, and gloomy castles for the Super Happy Tree, which has been stolen by the dreaded Baby Bowser. Yoshi can walk, run, swim, leap, flutter, and fire his payload of eggs. The action takes place in storybook "pages" made up of bookmaking materials and other familiar textures, including cut-paper forests, denim clouds, inflatable plastic islands, and stacks of colored spools.

Yoshi's Story pioneers use of the Rumble Pak as a key element of the game-play experience, as you'll be able to feel invisible but treacherous currents when Yoshi swims through oceanic depths. The Rumble Pak can also help you locate hidden fruit or other objects by rumbling when Yoshi smells something. With a light touch of the Control Stick you can float on a leaf, ride a friendly dragon, and tiptoe past a swarm of angry bees.</desc>
