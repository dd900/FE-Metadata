game: 007: The World Is Not Enough
file: ./007 - The World Is Not Enough (USA).chd
description:
	Bond's Best Missions! Battle through 10 exciting levels with a variety of objectives.
	- Over 20 Q-Lab Gadgets and Weapons! Bond's P2K, Infrared Glasses, Cell Phone Stunner, and many more.
	- All new 3D Engine! High resolution textures, fast framerate and amazing view distances make this the best-looking POV game on the PlayStation game console.
	- Improved AI! Enemies will react to you, communicate with each other, and even retreat!
	- Authentic Dialogue! Interact with other characters and experience movie-like cinematics with full speech.
	This version of the game has a few notable differences to its Nintendo 64 counterpart: it runs off a version of the Medal of Honor engine, and has 11 missions in contrast to the N64's 14; some of which are not shared between the two. The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry.

description:
	The storyline in Lemmings 3D appears unrelated to previous Lemmings games, presumably because the story in All New World of Lemmings never got completed, and because the previous developer, DMA Design, was no longer involved in the series. Instead, there is an introduction movie showing a completely flat (2D) lemming popping out of a computer's floppy drive, and finding a "3D" button to press, which makes him 3-dimensional. After that, the PC blows up and the (now 3D) lemmings inside it escape.

In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.
	.
	Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.

game: Allied General
file: ./Allied General (USA).chd
description:
	Allied General is the sequel to Panzer General and uses the same turn-based gameplay mechanics. This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.
	.
	The most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for a little amount of turns) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.

description:
	Alundra is a boy who can step into other people's dreams. His own dreams tell him to go to the village Inoa. The ship on which Alundra is coming to the village goes down, but Alundra himself is washed up on a beach near the village. There, a blacksmith Jess takes care of him and treats him like his own son. But Alundra, stepping into the dreams of the village people, understands there's a danger somewhere. The people have horrible nightmares, and only Alundra can find out what they mean...
	.
	Alundra is an action role playing game (RPG) somewhat similar to the famous Zelda games. It uses real-time combat and has a lot of physical and environmental puzzles. A big part of the game is spent in dungeons, where the player has to solve puzzles in order to proceed.
	.
	This is a patch that fixes issues introduced in the US version of the PlayStation game Alundra by its publisher, Working Designs.
	The US version of the game increases the HP and sometimes other stats of nearly all enemies and bosses, adding needless tedium to the gameplay.
	This patch restores the enemy stats to what they were in the Japanese version, and also reverts some less noticeable tweaks.

description:
	Initially released for the PC in 2001, The Amazing Virtual Sea-Monkeys float their way to the PlayStation in a life-development simulation set in a sprawling 70 levels of undersea environments. Players are challenged to lead the newly hatched sea-monkeys to the safety of the Venus Shell, but must do so without any direct control over them. Instead, players control Nautila, the sea-monkey's protector and guide, who is a 358-year old fish that uses her multi-purpose long nose for various actions.
	Predators, traps, plants, and objects stand in the way of getting her charges to safety, but Nautila can use some underwater creatures to help control the frisky sea-monkeys. Ollie the Octopus, goldfish, blowfish, jellyfish, lantern fish, dogfish, and more can all be harmful in some ways to the sea-monkeys, but their characteristics can also be harnessed by Nautila to good advantage. Other gameplay elements include using bubbles to either protect sea-monkeys or imprison their enemies, collecting a certain number of goldfish to clear levels, and the requirement to rescue a specific number of sea-monkeys within pre-set time limits per level.

No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.

file: ./Armorines - Project S.W.A.R.M. (USA).chd
description:
	A long time ago, in a distant galaxy, an alien race was fighting for survival. Over thousands of years, their society had expanded until their home planet could no longer support the population. The only way to continue their civilization was to look to the stars. For many years the aliens searched for another planet that could support life, and just when they were about to give up hope, they discovered a small, green and blue planet in a distant galaxy - it was perfect, almost too good to be true.
	A plan of action was devised and swiftly executed. First they sent some breeding pods, these pods were designed to land on the planet and break open, scattering hundreds of aliens over the area. They would then start to colonize the planet in readiness for the main body of aliens, which would travel at a much slower pace in a gigantic spacecraft.
	These pods landed in a remote part of Siberia and their passengers began to multiply. It was however, not as remote as the bugs had hoped and they found themselves close to a human military base. The bugs waited underground until they were strong and had multiplied sufficiently to take on the humans.
	When the time was right, the decision was made and the bugs attacked the base - to make ready for the arrival of the main hive. They had to move quickly to spread to other parts of Earth.
	The military quickly mobilized against the 'bug' threat, but their conventional forces proved to be useless. Overpowered by the toxins emitted by the new enemy, there was only one thing left, a secret, experimental battle suit, originally developed for use by ground forces in nuclear conflict - it's untested, but it's the only chance. They just need someone brave enough to give it a shot...
	The Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. missions may be played by one or two players. There are also four multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Racewars, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill.

	The little plastic army men you played with as a child are toys no longer! They are now living beings bent on destruction. Of course, you get to play an integral role in the conflict as Sarge, a sergeant (you were expecting another rank?) in the Green Army. While your objectives vary with each mission, the goal is to defeat the evil Tan Army using a little strategy and a lot of firepower.

Roll, duck, kneel, and cycle through your available weapons as you try to complete the objectives detailed at the beginning of each level. Missions range from search-and-destroy to rescue or reconnaissance operations, and you'll even drive one of four vehicles during the battles. Units include versions of six classic toys: Rifle Man, Grenadier, Bazooka Man, Mortar Man, Flamethrower, and Minesweeper.

game: Assault Rigs
file: ./Assault Rigs (USA).chd
description:
	In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.
	.
	Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.
	.
	Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.
	.
	Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.

game: Asteroids
file: ./Asteroids (USA).chd
description:
	Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.
	.
	You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.
	.
	There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.
	.
	The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....
	.
	Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.

description:
	ATV Mania is an all-terrain vehicle combat racing game. Modes include Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack.
	.
	The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French Alps. The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary.
	.
	The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles.

Also, other species have since joined the Interstellar BallBlazer Conference.
	BallBlazer is similar to one-on-one indoor soccer with weapons. Your main objective is to put the ball into the goal more than your opponent can. Characters ride vehicles called rotofoils that they use to speed around the arenas. In order to win a match you must win two out of three of the 4-minute rounds. To become the champion eight opponents must be defeated.
	Eight characters are available to choose from and game modes include: practice, tournament, 1-player free play, and 2-player free play. BallBlazer Champions requires one memory block for each saved game.

game: Ballerburg: Castle Chaos
file: ./Ballerburg - Castle Chaos (USA).chd
description:
	Defend a castle against attacks while laying siege to the enemy with well-placed projectiles in this PS port of the German PC game. A mix of traditional real-time strategy and action puzzle-solving, the basic concept of Ballerburg: Cannons Catapults may remind some older gamers of the early-'90s classic Rampart. The game's story, told tongue-in-cheek, casts players as generals, in charge of the queen's military and based in her castle. War is waged over long distances, with classic siege weapons and powerful magic.
	The queen's two sisters each have their own armies and fortifications, and the battle will not be finished until only one castle is left standing. As the game progresses, castles collect tax revenue. Generals can use these funds to add new armaments, placing them where they'll do the most damage to the enemy, and also build additional defenses and repair damage that has already been done. Players are ranked according to their performances and may even earn a medal if they are especially successful on the battlefield.
	Playing like Worms in 3D, or Worms 3D if you like, the idea is to raze your opponent?s castle to the ground through the use of cannons and catapults. These must to be aimed manually while taking wind speeds into consideration, and also need a few seconds to reload at which point both yourself and your enemy are vulnerable. New arsenal can be researched, including triple catapults, while later zeppelins and magic attacks such as thunderstorms become available. There?s a little bit of resource management to take into account as well, with various buildings available to rake in the gold.

game: BassRise
file: ./Bass Rise (USA).chd
description:
	In Bass Rise you can catch three kinds of fish: largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Aside from catching fish, the motivation to continue playing comes from collecting more lures (hundreds in all) and finding new fishing locations: lakes, canals, docksides, etc.
	Tying the game together are story sequences featuring other anglers who offer advice and challenges, such as catching a set number of fish in five casts. In addition, the game sports a multiplayer contest mode that supports up to four players - but they don't compete at the same time, which deadens the appeal a bit. Instead, each player gets a fixed number of chances to cast and haul in a fish - and the largest catch wins.

description:
	Himitsu Kessha founded the Toshinden--held annually, these tournaments feature strong combatants from all around the world. After the established corporation found out a nonsanctioned tournament was held by Gaia, they began organizing another Toshinden; their motivations are to lure the rebel to the tournament and have him slain for his insolence.
	Thus is the premise behind Battle Arena Toshinden 2, the sequel to the PlayStation's first rotational, 360-degree 3D fighting game. Featuring characters from the original, there are eleven fighters in all, including Eiji Shinjo, Kayin Amoh, Tracy, Chaos, and Duke B. Rambert; characters feature their own arenas, moves, combinations, weapons, and special attacks. Additionally, there is a mysterious bonus character waiting to be unlocked and two bosses to fight.
	There are a few game play options including the one player, full battle, and versus modes. Whereas the one player mode will have you battling against eight computer-controlled opponents, the full battle option throws you into a heated tournament of 10 characters--not including the bosses. The versus mode is selectable at any time, as long as you have access to a secondary controller; here you'll fight against a human opponent.

	Blast Chamber features sixty levels set throughout rotational 3D chambers. As the chamber moves, the floor becomes a wall and the walls turn into ceilings and floors. The objective of each level is to obtain the crystal within the allotted time and before your competition to progress to the next chamber and avoid a rather gruesome death.

game: Bomberman Party Edition
file: ./Bomberman - Party Edition (USA).chd
description:
	The gameplay in Bomberman Party Edition represents something of a return to the classic Bomberman style of play. There aren't a lot of extra hoops to jump through, just a lot of things to blow up. The idea is basic; make your way around the board and explode as much stuff as you can. Of course as in the original, lots of power-ups are available to add to the excitement and bring new strategic considerations into the mix. A single-player "story mode" is available, but the most significant advance in this version of the classic game is that it allows up to five players to compete at once.
	The "Battle Royal Mode" allows competitors to challenge one another in the classic Bomberman setting and a "Custom Battle Mode" let's players tweak the options and settings to their liking. As frantic as a good single-player game of Bomberman can be, five people playing on the same screen can increase the frenzy exponentially.
	Features:
	Play alone through 50 stages or compete with friends in "Battle Royal" or "Custom Battle"
	Take on a variety of monsters with their own abilities and personality
	Defeat your enemies in various single-and tag-team battles

	Breath of Fire III also includes a Master System, which permits Ryu and his allies to learn from various people to augment their abilities differently as they gain experience; these trainers can also teach abilities to those whom train hard under them.

	Nina, the princess of Wyndia, and Cray, chieftain of the cat-like Woren tribe, are searching for Cray's relatives who disappeared under mysterious circumstances during a diplomatic mission. Flying through the sky on their sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy.

	This fourth installment of the  Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the  previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for "masters" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well.

description:
	Broken Helix puts you in the boots of an armed marine of a special forces team.  You are sent in to a military base which has been taken over by terrorists for unknown reasons.
	.
	The main character is voiced by Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead movies.  Throughout the game, he makes wisecracks and one-liners, and dialogue with personnel is generally comical.
	.
	Broken Helix is considered a 4D game.  For example, if you are on the third floor, you may have to make your way up to the fifth floor in order to defuse a bomb.  There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die.
	.
	There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to open doors.
	.
	In order to be successful, you must sneak past cameras and other devices, in order to find out the truth behind the terrorist takeover.

It is also notable for being an early example of a game with multiple endings, which depended on the player's skill and discovering secrets.

When they pop the bubbles, fruit comes out and the players compete for the points. If they don't pop the bubbles in time, the enemies escape and become faster.

description:
	Bubsy 3D: Furbitten Planet, also known simply as Bubsy 3D, is a platform video game developed by Eidetic and published by Accolade and Telstar for the PlayStation video game console. Designed by Michael Berlyn, it was released on October 13, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. It is the fourth and final game in the Bubsy series, starring its eponymous protagonist. It is one of the first 3D platform games, though with limited movement. The game's complete name is a parody of Forbidden Planet, a 1956 sci-fi film. A Sega Saturn version was planned but was cancelled.
	The game was very poorly received and was regarded as one of the worst games of all time by GameTrailers, IGN, GamesRadar, and humorist Seanbaby. Many of the major elements of the game received criticism; it has been criticized for its graphics, its controls, and the personality of Bubsy, the latter which IGN felt was ruined from the previous Bubsy games. It holds an aggregate score of 50.90% at Game Rankings based on five reviews. Berlyn attributes its low quality to its release coinciding with Super Mario 64, which he found to be far superior; however, due to development being nearly done and Accolade wanting it to be released, there was no time to improve upon it.

game: Cardinal Syn
file: ./Cardinal Syn (USA).chd
description:
	For decades, the clans of Bloodland were locked in a never-ending war; then the Wanderer arrived with the Book of Knowledge. He divided the book and gave each clan a piece, hoping the clans would come to rely on each other's newly acquired knowledge. The Wanderer left and the clans, hoping to reassemble the book, returned to their old ways.
	.
	That is when Syn appeared. She turned the pieces of the book into weapons and organized a tournament of the clans' warriors. Whoever wins the tournament will control the Book of Knowledge and become the ruler of Bloodland.
	.
	Choose one of 20 characters, each with unique combos and weapons, and battle your way through the tournament. If the tournament is too much for you, practice your moves or fight in the Survival or Team Battle modes. Do you have what it takes to become the ruler of Bloodland?
	.
	A gory one-on-one fighting game, set within a series of semi-free-roaming enviroments.

game: Carmageddon
file: ./Carmageddon (Europe).chd
description:
	Motorized carnage.  Ever wanted to hit pedestrians during a race?  Now's your chance. Carmageddon is an ultra-violent racing game which caused much controversy during the '90s but was also very popular due to its fun factor. It was also one of the first batch of games to make use of 3D accelerated graphics (using OpenGL and 3dfx Voodoo cards).
	.
	At the beginning of the game the player only has one car and is ranked at #99. The overall objective is to race all the way to the top, collecting the opponents' cars on the way as trophies (and possibly replacements to his vehicle). In the race itself the player tries to damage opponents by driving into them, and can also kill pedestrians. Damage, kills and spectacular moves earn credits for the player which can be used for upgrades and even making repairs to the car at anytime during the race. If you wreck a certain car in 4 races or so, you get to drive it. There are many power-ups strewn around the courses which range from useful to fun to downright absurd. Though the player can win by racing fairly and normally, most players found it much more fun to wreck everything in sight.
	.
	Carmageddon is a violent game which is probably not suitable for minors.

game: Carnage Heart
file: ./Carnage Heart (USA).chd
description:
	Carnage Heart is a video game for the PlayStation, developed by Artdink. Its gameplay is a mecha-based, turn-based strategy game, where the player takes the role of a commander in a war fought by robots. The robots, called Overkill Engines (OKEs), cannot be directly controlled in battle; they must be programmed beforehand to behave in a certain way under certain conditions using a flow diagram system.
	GAMEPLAY:
	The game also features a fairly complex negotiation system that allows the player to purchase, research, or upgrade new equipment and parts. The OKEs themselves can be upgraded as well through this system, allowing for extended use of the same model for as long as possible. The various companies involved in the negotiation process can also provide valuable information about the purchases of the enemy, allowing the player to better plan for the next advancement in enemy technology.

game: Castlevania Chronicles (Arrange Knockback)
file: ./Castlevania Chronicles (Arrange Knockback).chd
description:
	This Castlevania game was originally released on the Sharp X68000 (a home computer relatively unknown outside of Japan) but never made it to the worldwide audience. This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the PlayStation with a good deal of new features.
	.
	This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.
	.
	This hack enables knockback back into Arrange Mode by merely replicating the same effect found in Original Mode, so now players get all of the features that Arrange Mode offers with all of the traditional knockback. It obviously makes the game harder, but it makes it true to what Original Mode offers in terms of punishing the player for taking damage.

Together, they set off on a grand adventure looking for pieces of the legendary Blue Crystal. In order to obtain the pieces, they must defeat other wacky racers including the Chubby Chocobo, White Mage, Behemoth, and more (eight in all).

description:
	Following the adventures of the first Chocobo Dungeon game, Chocobo and Mog continue to search for treasure. One day, Mog discovers a new Mysterious Dungeon and takes the treasure from inside. This releases a seal which causes the Bahamut to appear just as the dungeons plunges into the ocean. Chocobo is rescued by a young white mage, Shiroma, who is the only human living in the monster village. Chocobo must help Mog, find Bahamut and fix whatever has been unsealed from the Mysterious Dungeon.
	.
	Chocobo's Dungeon 2 is a simple action / rpg in the style of other games in the  Mysterious Dungeon series. Chocobo must decend into dungeon areas alone or with a partner (controlled by the cpu or the second player), gathering treasure, while finding the passageway to the next floor and satisfying hunger. The game is viewed from the top down as all objects on the screen move at the same time. Chocobo can equip a single weapon and armor item, while the hunger level is satisfied by eating different forms of nuts. Spells can be collected, while successive casting increases the proficiency in that spell. Unlike other Mysterious Dungeon games, Chocobo keeps his level and stats between trips to the dungeon. Boss monsters wait at the completion of most objectives. Different subquests are available from the residents of Monster Town.

description:
	This game features digital photography instead of the hand-drawn anime-style art from the other titles. It was released for the Sega Saturn a year later and the PlayStation Network in Japan in 2009. The subtitle of this game loosely translates to "The Ultimate, Most Strongest Man in the Milky Way" or "The Ultimate, Invincible, Most Galactically Powerful Man". The game is based on the engine of the first Cho Aniki. As such, Idaten and Benten are again the main two characters. The game is often derided as having the worst play mechanics in the series. Even some of the most fervent fans of Cho Aniki claim that the campy fun is inhibited by poor control and impossible difficulty. Koji Hayama returned to score a few songs for the soundtrack, along with Don McCow, Taku Iwasaki and Sanae Kasahara.
	Newly formed publisher MonkeyPaw Games released this game on September 21, 2010 in North America and on October 5, 2011 in Europe on the PlayStation Network.

game: Chrono Cross
file: ./Chrono Cross (USA).m3u
description:
	Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.
	.
	The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.
	.
	Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act.
	.
	Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.

game: Circuit Breakers
file: ./Circuit Breakers (USA).chd
description:
	Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track.
	.
	The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly.
	.
	The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode.
	.
	Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a "bird's eye" viewpoint.
	.
	Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using a multi-tap).

description:
	Re-write history with Civilization II as you lead your people to the promised land of peace and harmony with neighbouring cultures. That's one theory anyway, though what usually happens is that the Chinese whisper of international diplomacy means that the message gets distorted in transmission.
	You start Civilization II as leader of a puny tribe of people, eking out a subsistence-level existence in a time where log fires are considered hi-tech. Using your leadership and strategy skills, you must explore your world, expand your empire and ensure the survival of your way of life in what can turn out to be a pretty dog-eat-dog world.
	As time passes and your success builds you will form new alliances, make new enemies, discover new technologies and systems of government . . .all with the aim of ensuring the persistence of your civilisation. Noble aims which will sometimes mean brinkmanship, double-dealing and back-stabbing, but it's for the greater good, and all that. With a new interface developed specially for PlayStation and a huge depth of gameplay, Civilization II lets you steer history from the Stone Age to the future, and wage war with anything from spears to stealth bombers.
	With FMV sequences bringing your most notable achievements to life, will you have greatness thrust upon you?

description:
	Cleopatra Fortune was originally released as an arcade title by Taito in 1996 and was followed by a Sega Dreamcast version in 2001 from Japanese publisher Altron Corporation. Renamed Cleopatra's Fortune, this block dropping Tetris-styled puzzle game now reaches the U.S. on the PlayStation with gameplay nearly identical to its predecessors. Players can select from four modes of play: Arcade, Versus, Mystery and Time Attack.
	Utilizing an Egyptian-style motif, block types include Rock, Mummy, Gem, and Sarcophagus, each with specific characteristics and "line" requirements that affect removal from the stacks of blocks that accumulate as they fall and pile up. Blocks can be removed in several ways using combos, enclosures, lines, and pyramid stones. Each mode features a unique objective, ranging from solving 50 Sphinx riddles in Mystery mode to the frenetic ten-stage action of Time Attack.

	Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, released in Japan as Clock Tower Ghost Head, was released in 1998 for the PlayStation. While sharing the gameplay mechanics of the first two, the game could be considered a spin-off from the main series.

It received overwhelmingly poor reviews, with critics citing the disjointed story and trial-and-error gameplay.

description:
	Codename: Tenka is an original first-person shooter developed for PlayStation and PC. In a futuristic setting, players take the well-armed role of the title character, who battles against the forces of a genetic engineering organization gone wrong. Enemies are varied, some deadly powerful, others agile, and difficult to hit.

Large, complex levels pose labyrinthine challenges, as well as the powerful bosses that wait secured in their deepest chambers. The game is set apart from contemporary first-person shooters by a crouch ability, which allows the lead character to crawl through ducts and other short spaces. The character can also run, strafe, and jump, for full-motion 3D shooter play.
	.
	Features:
	* Upgrade your gun with mods found throughout each level
	* Navigate Tenka through a variety of environments to stop the genetic experiments
	* Use laser sighting to find your enemy and take him out in the light or in the dark

description:
	Colin McRae Rally 2.0 is a racing video game developed and published by Codemasters for PlayStation. It is the second game in the Colin McRae Rally series. You get to race in locations around the world, over 60 stages in eight different countries. Battle your way towards winning the championship. You can choose from many real life car models, and tune them up to match the conditions! The game realistically simulates all road types, weather conditions, and the physics of car handling create an authentic rally experience. The locations and the cars are all real!
	.
	Colin 2.1 is a gameplay-enhancing fix that\n
	- Makes that windscreen in the cockpit view completely transparent\n
	- Makes the car controls respond instantly when using analog devices
	.
	In the original game steering, brakes and accelerator did not follow instantly the analog input as their movement speed was limited, resulting in unadequate car control. Now they are mapped directly to the position of the analog axes, taking also in account for the car settings (brake power and steering sensitivity)

	Command & Conquer: Red Alert for the PlayStation is a conversion of the hit computer game of the same name. The game involves commanding either the Soviets or Allies through 14 different missions, which vary depending on the side you choose. In order to amass your troops (consisting of tanks, infantry, naval and air forces), you must first build various structures with your available funds. Each map screen will have two types of natural resources (ore and gemstones) that can be collected to finance your operation. Missions generally involve building a base, mining resources and generating a mix of troops to mount an assault on the enemy's base.
	The PlayStation version supports the mouse and includes a Skirmish mode, which lets you face up to three computer opponents on 20 different maps in an all-out battle for domination. Want to start out with more credits or troops? How about increase the game speed? These options can all be adjusted before you begin a game. The PlayStation version also supports the Link Cable so you can battle a second player head to head or with computer-controlled AI teams. Twenty-one music tracks will keep your foot tapping as you wage war, and a password save feature will allow you to continue your single-player missions at a later time.

game: Creatures

description:
	In Creatures, you'll discover the fascinating universe of artificial intelligence. Albia is the wondrous place where the Norns live. They are peaceful, lovable, intelligent, and curious creatures, always enthusiastic about discovering and exploring their surroundings.
	They will encounter many unfamiliar things, which can be entertaining but dangerous, too. The evil Grendels are the greatest threat to them, but if you guide them responsibly and show them what's good and what's bad in their world, your Norns will develop a better understanding of their environment.

game: Creatures: Raised in Space
file: ./Creatures - Raised in Space (USA).chd
description:
	The game takes place upon the Shee Ark, where the player must save the Norns by opening up the doors to the different Terrariums (the same that are in Creatures 3). Around the world are small, blue stars that must be placed in a machine by the Norns in order to generate a key. However, the stars have a limited lifespan, with stars that rotate faster nearing the end of their lifespan. When exactly 25 Stars are placed in the machine, it will generate a key. In order to be able to carry stars, Norns must be trained from an early age.
	Unlike previous Creatures games, each Norn must collect ten hearts in order to become fertile. These hearts are found throughout the shee ark, and can be collected by both Scrubby and the Norns. Ettins and Grendels are always infertile.
	Around the world are a variety of medicinal plants, that closely, if not exactly, resemble Herbs from Creatures. These herbs have special effects on Norns, such as promoting sleep, getting rid of illness and decreasing Tiredness. Too many of these herbs can cause addiction. There are also several varieties of weeds found in the Jungle Terrarium that can be detrimental to a Norn's health.
	Like the original Creatures Game, Norns in Creatures: Raised in Space are programmed to die from Illness at a Certain Age. The average lifespan of a Norn in this game is around four hours.

description:
	Ever since the beginning of the 21st Century, crime has been getting worse and more severe. Criminals patrol the streets like everyday citizens looting valuables, murdering arch rivals, and speeding up and down city streets and highways. The question is: what is anyone going to do about these hoodlums?
	The answer lies within an elite force of police officers -- the Crime Killers. After purchasing the City Police Department, the URIEL Consortium gave the taskforce new uniforms, weapons, and three patrolling vehicles capable of considerable damage; the Turbo Patrol Car is a destructive land vehicle, the Bike is a speedy motorcycle, and the Wing reigns terror from the skies! Its time to take the streets back!

This system gives players the play-it-again variety that will have them wanting to play Crisis Beat again and again.
	When you can't make the grade on your own you can call on a friend to help in two player mode. Here there are two teams to choose from and, depending on which one is selected, chooses which stage and "BOSS" you start the game with.

	Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact.

	.
	The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.

description:
	In the value-priced Crossroad Crisis, it's up to you to protect a wandering baby chick stranded in a maze of red, green and blue tiles. By moving and rotating the tiles, you can create a safe path for the chick to walk on. But in order to complete each of the game's ten stages, you must first clear the required number of tiles from the board.
	Tiles are cleared by linking two or more of the same color and having the chick walk over them. Once the target number has been cleared, the exit appears and you can lead the chick to the next stage. The number of cleared tiles necessary to reveal the exit increases as the game progresses. Each time the chick walks off the edge of a tile, a life is lost and the board is reset.
	In addition to the ten stages of Clear mode, Vs. mode pits the chick against a duck in a two-player battle to clear tiles and lead your animal to safety first. Beginner mode contains three stages and a lesson on how to play.

If you're playing with the timer on, the tank with the highest level of shield strength when the time runs out wins the battle.

description:
	Cyberspeed is the World Television event of the future. Spread throughout the galaxy, there are ten tracks, each of which consists of a looped force beam, with other force beams branching off it. Each of the eight ships is connected to the track by a force beam, and each ship draws energy directly from the force beams. Energy to your ship can be drained by taking corners too fast, firing your weapons, getting hit by enemy fire, colliding with other ships, and by simply driving the ship. You can increase your energy by picking up power-ups that you'll find along the tracks. Each ship comes with a few extra engine power cells which can be used to break the sound barrier.
	Cyberspeed is broken up into three different kinds of races: Tournament Race, Free Race, and Time Trial. The tournament consists of ten different basic races against seven opponents, with additional bonus races that pit you against Super Ships. The Free Race is a single race against seven opponents, and you can only race on the first two tracks or on ones that you have already completed. The Time Trial is similar to the Free Race, but with only two pilots competing. In each of the three kinds of races, you can choose between eight different ships. Each ship is ranked according to thrust, mass, speed, and shield strength, and each ship is equipped with the same kinds of weapons: plasma bolts, missiles, and mines.

game: Cyberwar
file: ./Cyberwar (Japan).m3u
description:
	Cyberwar is a game based on the Lawnmower Man movies that were loosely based on a Stephen King short story, and stars Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo.
	.
	Dr. Lawrence Angelo is a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries (VSI) in "Project 5", a secret research facility that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and virtual reality (VR) training. Dr. Angelo is reluctant to use the research for military purposes, and after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard, Dr. Angelo is given a forced vacation. While taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he discovers Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living by doing odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence the title of the movie). Angelo takes in Jobe, subjecting him to VR treatment.
	.
	The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, but after an accident, Dr. Angelo stops the experiments. The Shop, a secret agency overseeing Project 5, reinserts the drugs responsible for Jobe's violent behavior into the program and speeds up the treatment. As Jobe develops telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he began the treatments, and plots to take over all of the computers in the world.
	.
	In late 1995, SCi released a sequel for MS-DOS, Macintosh computers & Playstation consoles known as CyberWar. Copies of the sequel are quite rare, as it had a limited release by Interplay instead of the publisher of the first game, Time Warner Interactive. CyberWar splits from the story of the second movie, Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace, and has its own story.
	.
	Cyberwar is a streaming action-adventure that relies on you pressing left or right at the appropriate second.

Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.
	.
	D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.

Aliens have infected your blood with their DNA to get you to fight on their side. These aliens, referred to as Reptons, are locked in a bitter struggle against the Ovons to decide the fate of their galaxy. Since the Reptons desperately need your skills, they have been kind enough to genetically fuse your body with one of their ships.

Missions range from dogfights, bombing runs, defending ships, as well as rescue and intelligence operations. Real-time lens flares and light sourcing will make the battles come alive, while 14 different weapons prepare you for whatever the enemy has in store.

	Darkstalkers, known in Japan as Vampire, is a series of 2D fighting games developed and published by Capcom, beginning with Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors (Vampire: The Night Warriors) in 1994. The series is set in a pastiche Gothic horror universe and features a highly stylized, cartoonish graphic style. It features characters based on either various kinds of monsters (the titular "darkstalkers") or their hunters, who are all engaging in combat against each other. Darkstalkers introduced many of the concepts used in later Capcom fighting games, including its first use of 16-bit color animation sprites and gameplay mechanics later employed in the Street Fighter Alpha and Marvel vs. Capcom series.

But don't think your opponents will treat you with the giving of flowers either, because they will aiming to send you and your vehicle back to smash repairers not in one piece, but for the sale of spare parts.
	From the main menu, players can select from Single Race, Demolition League and Two Player modes. Single Race is further broken down into Demolition (the importance is both based on getting over the finishing line and scoring demolition points), The Chase (crossing the finishing line is the only goal), Chicken (drive aggressively, but try to stay alive to cross the finish line, and oh yeah there are cars driving in the opposite direction too you), Last Man Standing (a bowl competition, last man not smashed up wins) and Suicide (opposite to Last Man Standing, it's a battle to destroy yourself first) all with the unifying idea of being based on a single race.
	Demolition League is a competition mode spread over various tracks with the very broadly split Arena and Circuit competitions. Circuit difficulties include Rookie League (5th or better to pass), Semi-Pro League (six demolition styled courses, but you have to place at least third in every race), Pro League (eight courses, but you must place first in all) and Endurance League. Two Player mode on the other hand not only allows players to play in the standard Single Race competitions (such as Chicken, Last Man Standing, Chase and Suicide), but also the Two Player only Team Demolition (a co-operative demolition mode) and Head 2 Head Demolition.

game: Descent
file: ./Descent (USA).chd
description:
	The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed "Material Defender", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.
	.
	Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).
	.
	The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.

description:
	.... Over a 1000 years ago when the Strega suddenly appeared in Zamu'el, a small country located on the edge of the continent. These Strega possessed mysterious powers, and so they were revered and respected by the men and women of Zamu'el.
	Aside from their mysterious powers, the Strega also possessed knowledge far more advanced than that of Zamu'el, in such fields as metallurgy and agriculture. The Strega gladly passed this knowledge on to the inhabitants of Zamu'el, transforming the once poor country into a prosperous nation. Furthermore, the Strega, in their kindness, created objects that would allow normal humans to control powers similar to their own and bestowed them upon the people.
	Many of these objects, called Jeno at the time, were made and presented to the populace of Zamu'el. As the people learned to use the Jeno, they began to extend their borders into neighboring lands. With their new powers, they felt invincible, and failed to listen to the warning of the Strega whom they had once revered as gods. In just a short 10 years, Zamu'el had conquered the entire continent.
	However, even as they destroyed the last of their enemies, their mighty Empire began to crumble. Greedy, ambitious men rebelled throughout the land - each rebellion fought by Jeno bearers. The Jeno War, as it was eventually called, unleashed unimaginable destruction upon the land and its people. The very continent they had fought to win, was nothing more than a wasteland of disease and death by the time the fighting ended. In addition, the devastating power of the Jeno vanished, making the objects nothing more than fancy trinkets.

game: Destruction Derby 2
file: ./Destruction Derby 2 (USA).chd
description:
	Strap in, hold on, hit the gas, and you're off on a quest for destructive points in Destruction Derby 2, the smashing sequel to the original demolition derby game from Reflections Interactive and Psygnosis. This edition offers seven larger tracks with lots of jumps and flips, as well as the dreaded crisscross sections where huge damage often ensues. Choose one of three cars and take your pent-up rage into one of four bowl arenas or one of four circuit courses. Let the mayhem begin!
	The new Pit Stop feature allows the player to make repairs to a damaged vehicle and head back out into the fray. Realistic physics deforms cars (and their nice paint job) as you collide with 19 other racers. The game's physics engine allows wheels, car hoods and other debris fly to everywhere. Localized damage adds an element of strategy too, as headfirst ramming destroys engines and can quickly take the driver out of the game. Players will have to develop some strong techniques or they'll be stalled on the sidelines by the middle of the game.

game: Destruction Derby RAW
file: ./Destruction Derby Raw (USA).chd
description:
	Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing," "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely discouraged either.
	Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb, where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb.
	Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.

Once in the world of Digimon Online however, the three friends are informed that the system is in dire need of repairs and that they'll have to stay until the repairs are complete.
	Viewed from a top-down isometric perspective, players must guide their virtual avatars through the online world, battling other "tamers" and exploring the many game areas while learning more about the hackers that have invaded the game. Situated in the many towns that dot the virtual landscape, shops and inns will provide the group with much needed supplies and rest, provided they have enough Bits (the world's currency) to afford it all, that is.
	The 3D Battles are turn-based, and provide a selection of battle options from which to choose, including the ability to unleash standard attacks, use items or special techniques, switch Digimon, or run from battle. In keeping with the cartoon on which it is based, Digimon are also able to Digivolve into more powerful creatures during battle.
	As your Digimon take damage, a blast meter gradually fills. When full, it allows the creature to Blast Digivolve, imbuing it with an increase in attack level. Tamers also have the ability to merge two creatures using the DNA Digivolve ability, which will yield an all-new Digimon who performs a random attack before disappearing. Through continued battling, Digimon will gain experience and rise in level and ability, and will eventually evolve into a new, permanent form.
	Along with the Digimon found in the first three seasons of the cartoon show, Digimon World 3 features 20 original Digimon created specifically for the game. An additional side-quest allows players to seek out Digimon cards in order to build a formidable deck with which to battle others. There are a total of 314 cards to be collected in the game.

	Based upon the Digimon: Digital Monsters cartoon show
	Engage in battles that will see your Digimon Digivolve, Blast Digivolve, and DNA Digivolve their way to victory

description:
	An abandoned research complex on a remote jungle island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast of Dino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the makers of Resident Evil.
	Dr. Edward Kirk is supposed to be dead. Three years ago while working to establish a new type of energy technology code-named Third Energy, an experiment went awry and terminated the brilliant scientist's life -- or so it was thought. It was recently learned, however, that Dr. Kirk is very much alive and continuing his work at a Borginia Republic research facility on Ibis Island.
	In order to investigate the situation, an elite special forces team including agents Regina, Gail and Rick was sent. The three expected another routine mission, but what they got was an all-out fight for their lives against an enemy they surely had never been trained to face -- dinosaurs!
	Luckily, Regina isn't restricted to limited firepower, as she'll come across shotguns, dart guns, and other weapons throughout the island. To gain access to the keys, code disks, and ID cards necessary for continued exploration, Regina must solve a variety of puzzles.
	Dino Crisis has three possible endings with a great deal of secrets becoming available after each has been viewed. These include new weapons, new costumes, and a "Wipe Out" mode in which you must defeat a certain number of dinosaurs within a designated time period.

If you can collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in the world with TARZAN.

	This game is a port of the Arcade game of the same name and was released only in Japan.
	The game's premises differ somewhat by most of its brethren: the player assumes the role of a pilot whose mission is to actually survive an eight years long training mission, where he/she is supposed to prove his/her worth as a fighter and gain entry to the future elite squadron known as the DonPachi Squadron - which is featured prominently throughout the entire series. The twist lies in the fact that the enemies are, in truth, the player's very own comrades, posing as enemies and sacrificing their lives for the sake of allowing only the most skilled pilots to pass the test, and survive.
	The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire: by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed.

description:
	Dragonheart: Fire and Steel was released to the public in 1996, and is a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up based off of the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of a retired knight who must return to action and remain true to the oaths he took long ago. An evil prince's tyranny threatens the land, and the knight (who was a former dragonslayer) can only defeat this scheming noble with the help of a friend who just happens to be the last surviving dragon on Earth.
	.
	Players must punch, kick, and slash their way through multiple levels in their quest, facing off against both weak and powerful enemies bent on stopping them. At the end of each level boss characters stand ready to slay the player, who must defeat them to continue, for retreat is not an option. Rendered and digitized graphics are used in the game to represent the backgrounds and characters respectively, though the title runs in a low graphic resolution.

game: Dune 2000

description:
	Dune 2000 is a remake of the classic Dune II updated for Windows. In this Real-Time Strategy game, you can play one of the three houses, the evil Harkonnen, the greed filled Ordos or the noble Atreides. Each has different sets of units and tactics while maintaining an overall balance.
	.
	Unlike the original, the cutscenes happen after every mission, with live-cast this time, already seen in Westwood Studio's Command & Conquer franchise. A 16-bit color mode was the next step for their RTS genre, boosting up the graphics in Dune 2000.
	.
	Everything from the original is back - sandworms, the spice, the Fremen, the known structures and the map of the planet, even the intro cinematic is a 3D enhanced version of the original one.
	.
	Each house fights differently. The noble Atreides have air-superiority and rely on their honour and alliance with planet natives, the Fremen. The insidious Ordos rely on guerrilla tactics and superior technology, as well as mercenaries. The evil Harkonnen just go brutal, with no care for lives of their own troops or destruction as longs as they are victorious.
	.
	Unlike the Windows version, the PlayStation version of the game is fully 3D.

The storyline is in line with the Koei war sims, so this is a fighting game based on real history. The characters are pulled straight from the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Each character is either based on or tied to one of the legendary warlords who fought to unite under their own kingdom.

Each planet contains a specific number of plants to find across three levels.
	.
	Worlds are also filled with hostile creatures or government agents, so E.T. needs to use his special powers to help him overcome all manner of threats. As E.T. walks and runs across the levels, he can call upon the power of telekinesis to move items closer, use his healing power to restore flowers, and unleash a heart stun to temporarily freeze enemies. Also available on each level are items such as keys or switches, which let E.T. access blocked areas. Progress in the adventure can be saved to a memory card.

Startled, he entered the passage only to find a large red book telling of the Rockwell dynasty. The family, as well as 45 other people, had vanished one year ago aboard the luxury boat Orpheus.

description:
	Charlie has really done it this time. While reaching for his beloved donuts, he accidently spilled coffee on his work station at the MomSteel Steel Factory. Now the machinery has taken on a life of its own! Assume control of Charlie the Egg in your effort to find the reset switch located somewhere within the factory. The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which are various forms of machinery, from Blast Furnace Bill to Rotato the Repair Robot.
	.
	In order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he'll need to walk across narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench, Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are paper airplanes (they'll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all, moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save that factory!
	.
	The most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you'll see Charlie do a Humpty Dumpty impression, and if you make it to the next level by punching the last time clock, a transition scene will play.

game: Einhänder

description:
	In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.
	.
	On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.
	.
	The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.

game: Eliminator
file: ./Eliminator (USA).chd
description:
	The Elimination event was the ultimate in televised arena combat. The participants were prisoners, of course, since no one sane enough would take up the gauntlet without some sort of incentive. Since those who survived the Elimination were granted reprieve and released back into society with both fame and wealth, the incentive was clear!
	All this came to an end during the Civil War. Instead of being televised, the Elimination served as a testing ground for weapons to be used in future battles. And the participants? They were prisoners of war, forced to compete solely for the amusement of the government. Now you happen to be next in line for the Elimination, and you're going to have to use all of your survival instincts to make it through alive.
	Eliminator lets you select one of four different crafts, each rated in shield power, weapons and top speed: the Redeemer, Freedom, Liberty and Survivor. The Elimination event is comprised of eight arenas filled with robotic creatures and futuristic defenses. You'll begin play in the Penitentiary, and then navigate through the Maze, Asylum, Cage, Chasm, Monastary, Tomb and Fortress.
	While the goal of surviving each arena may sound straightforward enough, there are a few things any budding pilot should be aware of before strapping in. First, your ship has a bomb attached to it! If you don't complete the arena within the time limit, the bomb will detonate. Another thing to worry about is the boss character after each level, so make sure you collect as many of the twelve assorted weapons as you can within the arenas.
	Progress will be saved after each level for those with a memory card, and two players can duke it out in three special duel zones: the Pit, the Dome and the Labyrinth. The object in the multi-player game is to simply destroy your opponent's base while protecting your own.

description:
	Dan Danger and Evo (a self-evolving robot) are the only ones brave enough to investigate the mysterious happenings on Space Station: Silicon Valley. Long ago, it was an experiment designed to see how artificial life would function in a controlled environment. The problem? The structure mysteriously disappeared without a trace -- only to reemerge some 1,000 years later. Unfortunately, Dan and Evo miscalculated their destination and flew straight into the space station! To make matters worse, Evo's robotic body exploded into a million pieces. Now they have to figure out a way to get back...
	Evo's Space Adventure has you playing the role of Evo as you make your way through four different environments within the station: Euro Eden, Arctic Kingdom, Jungle Safari and Desert Adventure, each spanning multiple zones filled with a variety of critters that aren't quite natural -- they're robotic versions of Earth's animals. While some may appear to be relatively harmless (dogs, rabbits or sheep), others will attack you on sight (foxes, huskies and walruses).

description:
	Conrad may have thought he escaped from the alien Morphs, but he thought wrong. After fighting his way through their world the first time, in a game called Flashback, he went into a cryogenic sleep aboard his little space vessel. For 50 years he drifted aimlessly in space, waiting to be found. The good news is that Conrad was found and beamed up on an alien ship; the bad news is that the alien race that found him is none other than his enemy: the Morphs. Once again, he must escape from their hostile world and regain his freedom that he had fought so hard for.
	Fade To Black is a sequel to the 2D classic Flashback. It picks up 50 years after the latter did, and uses the same character.

game: Fear Effect
file: ./Fear Effect (USA).m3u
description:
	It starts as a simple assignment for the three mercenaries - the beautiful, mysterious Hana, the former army officer Glas, and the ruthless killer Deke. Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan...
	.
	The gameplay of "Fear Effect" is based on survival horror titles à la  Resident Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences, where precise timing matters. You can crouch, sneak on your enemies, and roll forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to eliminate or to avoid. The game's characters are created in animé style, although they appear in full 3D. The backgrounds are pre-rendered, but very intensely animated, similar to those of  Blade Runner. The story unfolds through numerous FMV cut scenes.

game: Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix
file: ./Fear Effect 2 - Retro Helix (USA).m3u
description:
	In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered.
	With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA will lead to mankind's complete undoing. It's up to three mercenaries and a mysterious woman with no past to combine their separate efforts into one adventure involving danger, intrigue, and supernatural involvement, with the prize perhaps being salvation for human kind.
	Fear Effect: Retro Helix is a cinematic adventure game for the PlayStation. Although it has been released after the original Fear Effect title, it is in actuality a prequel to the events in the first game, explaining how Hana Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Jacob Decourt wound up together. The game takes place over four levels, each of which has its own CD: futuristic, gritty Hong Kong, the Walled City of Xi'an, the Tomb of the First Emperor of China, and the legendary Penglai Shan, mountain home to the immortals.

description:
	Based on a movie by the same name, The Fifth Element is a third-person adventure wherein you take on the persona of one of two characters. Your two choices stem from the two main ones from the movie, Korben Dallas or Leeloo Minai Lekatariba-Lamina-Tchai Ekbat.
	Korben, played by Bruce Willis in the film, is a cab driver. He lives in New York City when the game starts, and he is the one man capable of saving the world.
	Leeloo is The Fifth Element. She is the only hope that the universe has against Pure Evil.
	The story goes that every five thousand years a door is opened between dimensions. One dimension is our universe, and the other is the anti-universe. This universe is known as Pure Evil, and waits for the doors to open, since every five thousand years the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, water) are gathered around the fifth the perfect being (Leeloo).
	The two characters have different options available to them. Korben can use guns, while Leeloo can use grenades. This helps you in certain aspects of the game, and choosing your character wisely can mean the difference between life and death.

description:
	What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.
	.
	Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle.
	.
	The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely.
	.
	The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.

game: Final Fantasy IX
file: ./Final Fantasy IX (USA).m3u
description:
	Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
	As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
	Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
	Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
	But what are the queen's true intentions?

game: Final Fantasy Tactics (Text Fix)
file: ./Final Fantasy Tactics (Text Fix).chd
description:
	Final Fantasy Tactics is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Sony PlayStation video game console. It is the first game of the Final Fantasy Tactics series and was released in Japan in June 1997 and in the United States in January 1998. The game combines thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. In contrast to other 32-bit era Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy Tactics uses a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters.
	.
	This is a relatively simple hack that fixes Ability, Equipment, Job/Monster, Treasure, and Unexplored Land names in Final Fantasy Tactics to something a bit more recognizable with today’s FF terms.
	This is meant to be done without affecting the original translation much as well as fixing translation errors, so the plot dialog has not been changed.
	Because of this the name changes are not 100% the same as War of the Lions: this patch uses a few WOTL terms, but also many already existing FF terms as sources.
	Most of the terms lifted are those in the GBA and PS1 eras to provide some familiarity with the games it was made around, as well as the originally used Japanese names.
	Spell Quotes and the like were also changed to reflect these alterations, along with a few fixes to such.

	.

	The aim is to have an end product that is accurate and professional. Official sources have been used to minimize errors in context and spelling.

	.
	Key Features
	Translated and localized from the ground up.
	All text updated.
	Option to keep original character names and series canon.
	Option for American English (as opposed to British English).

	Players race amongst four other riders, taking on a twisted track with plenty of places to catch air, but they won't just be jockeying for the head of the pack. They'll also have to mix some tricks into their run, because position is not only determined by where you are in the pack, but how stylish and challenging your run is in terms of stunts. There are over 30 tricks in all to keep you occupied.
	There are ten different tracks for you to challenge in Freestyle Motocross, ranging from predictable locations such as Las Vegas to more exotic locales like Tombstone and Loch Ness. Each track is built to suit both speed and tricks, alternating between straight-aways and bumpy terrain perfect for executing a combo or holding that trick for just a moment longer in order to score bigger points.
	Of course, if the racing aspect of the game isn't your cup of tea, you can also switch to a plain Freestyle mode where the only goal is to do tricks and score points - perfect for those who like to cut out everything but the basics. You can also choose to play a Single Race or run some Time Trials. And if you get tired of playing by yourself, grab a friend and go head to head in Multiplayer mode.

Fortunately, the frog has been endowed with supreme powers including regular hops and super-hops, the ability to float over water and land, a Power Croak for calling missing tadpoles and a bug-seeking tongue.
	Additionally, power-ups are strewn about including secret coins, extra lives, quick hops and auto hops. In multiplayer sessions, players utilize slow hops that significantly decrease hopping speeds.

game: Front Mission 3
file: ./Front Mission 3 (USA).chd
description:
	Front Mission 3 is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the Front Mission series. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 3 is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.
	While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in Front Mission 3. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to Front Mission 3 is the Double Feature Scenario - this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.

description:
	Taking place only ten days after the events in the original G-Police, the sequel G-Police: Weapons of Justice centers around a group of small gangs in Callisto. The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers have been answered.
	.
	After an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival.
	.
	When the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.

description:
	G-Darius revolves around a conflict between the humanoids of Amnelia and cyborg/chimera biovessels known as the "Thiima" (meant to mean simply "bringers of death"). The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.

Her parents have hired a detective named Travis to investigate a gang run by the notorious crime boss Kintaro; some say the gang is involved with the darker side of life, namely Hell. Knowing how difficult the mission is, the detective will need all the assistance he can get.
	Joining Travis on his brutal and bloody quest is an old friend named Michelle, a martial arts mentor known as Ushi and his student, Tetsuo.

The objective is to create a solid plane of blocks in order to prevent others from piling up to the top of the playfield. Creating a plane of blocks without gaps (called a "face") causes the blocks on that plane to disappear. There are 24 different block patterns in all, each composed of one to five cubes.

	"Is it just me, or am I engulfed in flames?" is one of the many one-liners uttered by Gex, a wise cracking gecko who should check himself into television rehab; he's addicted to it. After saving the Television Realm from the evil Rez in his first adventure, the gecko was ready to kick back, relax, and watch a little television. Little did he know his adventure was just beginning.
	One day, two secret agent goons showed up at Gex's doorstep. They inform him that Rez is back and looking for vengeance; the evil monster is planning to destroy the Television Realm once more...and possibly the world. When Gex tells them that he's retired and doesn't care, one of the goons hits the gecko on the head and takes him to a secluded place.
	When Gex comes to, the mystery men plead with the gecko to take the cash and help destroy Rez for good...or at least make him disappear. With that incentive (the cash), the wise cracking lizard slips into his special agent suit and plunges headfirst into the Television Realm. Watch out, Rez -- Gex is back!

	Evil lurks out there in the universe and only you, aboard your trusty Vic Viper starfighter, can put an end to it. Gradius Gaiden is yet another shooter in the Gradius series.
	.
	Gameplay consists of moving your fighter across side-scrolling stages shooting everything in sight and avoiding enemy fire, with your objective being to reach the end and defeat the stage boss to move on. You can collect power-ups which fills your power-up bards and which can then be triggered at any time for a specific effect depending on what bar is active at the moment.

game: Gran Turismo
file: ./Gran Turismo (USA).chd
description:
	Gran Turismo is fundamentally based on the racing simulator genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.
	.
	However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.
	.
	Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They can be found in the North American version's code (and are unlockable via a GameShark cheat device). In addition to the hidden del Sols, there is also a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to Arcade mode. The Corvette and Roadster can also be accessed via GameShark.

game: Grand Slam
file: ./Grand Slam (USA).chd
description:
	Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.
	Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.
	.
	Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.
	Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.

game: Grand Theft Auto
file: ./Grand Theft Auto (USA).chd
description:
	In Grand Theft Auto, you assume the role of a street thug working for an organized syndicate of criminals that specializes in stealing cars. Every time your pager beeps, the boss needs you to steal something for him -- if you don't get to a payphone and answer the message, you'll be in hot water (or is that cold water at the bottom of the East River).
	After receiving your mission, you'll have to navigate city streets that are bustling with pedestrians, cops (your worst enemies), and traffic jams. Because you're pressed for time, you can't just walk to your destination on foot -- that would take too long. Instead, you'll have to go car jacking, the art of physically removing people out of their vehicles and stealing it.
	.
	.
	.
	This is the premise behind Grand Theft Auto, an overhead action game of thievery. There are four large cities in which you'll have to steal cars, shoot rival gang members, and complete missions for the boss. Each mission requires you to get something from point "A" to point "B". For example, the head honcho wants to pull off a bank heist -- instead of using regular cars, they want you to steal a couple taxicabs for them. This way, the cops won't be able to find them as easily in traffic.

description:
	Grand Theft Auto: Mission Pack #1 - London 1969 is an official expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto. Instead of the fictional interpretations of New York, Miami and Los Angeles of the original, this game opens up the city of London to the player. The game features thirty new vehicles, new graphics and thirty-two new missions; all in a distinctly British theme. The new city contains many familiar landmarks from London in the late 60s as well as other cultural reference and Cockney slang. This time the player can choose the avatar's appearance, otherwise gameplay has not been changed from the original game. The player still is involved in organized crime and must perform a variety of criminal activities.
	.
	This patch allows you to play the game without the need to perform a disc swap for the original Grand Theft Auto disc.

game: Grand Theft Auto 2
file: ./Grand Theft Auto 2 (USA).chd
description:
	The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.
	.
	Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.
	.
	New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.

game: The Granstream Saga
file: ./Granstream Saga, The (USA).chd
description:
	One hundred years ago, the planet of Granstream was ravaged by a war between the Imperial Wizardry and the Allied Spirit Army. To break the deadlock, the Imperial Wizardry unleashed a forbidden weapon long since banned by both sides, causing the planet's axis to shift and flooding the world in the process. Four wise men, aligned to the elements of fire, water, earth, and wind, managed to raise four continents into the air, saving those they could. Now however, the descendants of the wise men responsible for this noble act have begun disappearing and reports emerge that Imperial airships have been spotted. Raised by a kindly man by the name of Valos, it falls to Eon, a young orphaned boy whose wrist is adorned by a mysterious bracelet called a Scepter, to save the continents.
	A 3D polygonal RPG, The Granstream Saga presents players with the usual allotment of items, weapons, and equipment, the collection of which is necessary should Eon have a chance of saving the continents of Shilf, Aquas, Volcos, and Zephere. On his journey, Eon will be accompanied by two woman, Laramee and Arcia, and a bird named Korky, though only he will engage in battle. Movement throughout the world is viewed from an overhead perspective, while battles take place in real-time 3D. The battles, which consist primarily of one-on-one duels, allow players full control over the character's movement within the confines of the battle area. Magic and melee attacks provide the necessary offensive capabilities, though if required the player can use a shield to block enemy attacks or evade them by double-tapping the directional pad in a specific direction. Special abilities can be learned and subsequently implemented during battles, many of which are unique to the weapon type your character currently wields.
	Once learned, these skills can be executed with the proper D-pad movements. Daggers, axes, and short and long swords can be used in battle, each with unique damage potential and speed of use. Enemies can been seen in the overworld, and thus battles avoided at the whim of the player. Interspersed between the battles are puzzles that require solving before the player can progress. Critical junctures in the plot unfold via animated cutscenes, and hand-drawn character portraits accompany conversations with significant characters in the game.
	Features
	Engage in real-time 3D combat using weapons and magic spells
	Traverse the four continents: travel through towns and explore dungeons

game: Grudge Warriors
file: ./Grudge Warriors (USA).chd
description:
	In the future, gang warfare is settled between gangs by using advanced armored vehicles. A mysterious figure called the Crimelord has set up a tournament on a secluded island dubbed "The Death Ring"  to get all the gangs to fight each other to earn his favor. It's up to the player to take their gang to the top by infiltrating all the opposing gang's bases of operation and take out their network of power generators which will effectively cripple those opposing factions.
	.
	Gameplay is centered around vehicular combat. Bases are defended by enemy vehicles, gun turrets, and mortars which harass the player while they are searching for the power generators to destroy. Players choose a vehicle (which represents a gang) with each coming with their own distinctive weapons such as shield draining bombs, energy megabolts, corrosive sulfur gas bombs and, mini-thermonuclear warheads. Each of the 23 missions contain power-ups such as invulnerability, invisibility, double damage, nitro boosts, and guided missile lock jammers. Powerups are earned after collecting a number of tokens scattered throughout each mission.
	.
	There is also a 2 player split screen combat mode where two players can fight against each other.

description:
	Gubble is a cute, colorful alien and he needs your help to get back to his home in this PlayStation game. It seems that creatures of Gubble's kind are particularly adept at loosening screws, nails, rivets, and other such fasteners. So adept, in fact, that Gubble has been kidnapped and sent to a dangerous planet to ply this skill. His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is successful.
	Success will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck), as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble's efforts. Not to mention the enemy creatures, who would rather their high-tech equipment remain in one piece.
	Features:
	* Use a variety of gadgets to help get Gubble home
	* A dozen challenging levels
	* Locate the Magic Ring to earn bonus time

The available modes are: street mode, story mode, versus (a single duel where you can choose your opponent), two time attack modes (where you must defeat either 8 regular enemies or 4 boss enemies as fast as possible) and survival (defeat as many enemies as possible; fight until you beat all of them, or until one of them beats you.)

game: Heart of Darkness
file: ./Heart of Darkness (USA).m3u
description:
	The eternally delayed Heart of Darkness has finally made its way to the PlayStation gaming console! One day, as Andy was in the park with his dog Whiskey, strange things started to happen. Almost in an instant, a vortex to some undiscovered realm opened up and sucked the poor doggie in. Determined to get his pooch back, Andy hopped in a homemade flying contraption and set off on a journey; where he was going, he did not know.
	On his way to this unknown world, Andy was met with some resistance and crash-landed into a wall of pure granite. Upon meeting up with a creepy monster, it was easy to see things were not kosher; this Land of Darkness has been overrun by horrific shadow monsters working in service of the Master of Darkness. It is the player's objective to ultimately destroy this evil nemesis, save Whiskey, and return home with both lives in tact.

game: Hellnight
file: ./Hellnight (Europe).chd
description:
	The future Tokyo is a megapolis built on top of a huge system of underground tunnels and sewers. A rumor is heard that in this underground world hide the followers of a mysterious cult, known as the Dark Messiah. At the same time a symbiotic life form escapes from scientists and makes it's way into the sewer system. There it causes the crash of a subway train and starts devouring the passengers on board. A lone hero, along with a schoolgirl Naomi Sugiura are the only survivors of the crash.... and must flee from the creature in order to survive.
	.
	Hellnight is a survival horror game at heart, although it has no combat gameplay. Controlling the nameless hero, the player must travel through the underground and protect Naomi. There is only one monster in the whole game, the "creature" itself, which is invulnerable and cannot be killed. Instead players are constantly on the run from it, making sure it does not catch them. The game is divided into large maze-like levels, each one usually populated by the creature who keeps pursuing the player (although he does change form after each level). At certain points there will be companions who can attack the monster and temporarily stun him. There are also people to talk to in the underground world, items to pick up, and puzzles to solve.

	Hi-Octane was originally released for the PC. It combines classic futuristic shooters like Defender and Nintendo's StarFox with fast paced racing titles such as The Need for Speed or Pole Position. Many reviewers regarded it, however, as a rip-off of Psygnosis' now classic WipeOut.
	Hi-Octane is a futuristic 3D racer featuring six unique hover-cars. Like many racing games, each vehicle varies in the areas of speed, attack power, and maneuverability; the KD-1 Speeder is a great all around car whereas Jugga is slower but packs a wallop in shields and firepower. Firepower comes in the form of mini-guns and rockets while pickups include weapon ammunition, boosts, and invincibility.

game: Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth
file: ./Hoshigami - Ruining Blue Earth (USA).chd
description:
	Utilizing a host of new gameplay elements, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth expands upon the formula made popular by the cult classic Final Fantasy Tactics. The continent of Mardias serves as the game's primary world, and is divided into three kingdoms: Nightweld, the Valaimian Empire and Gerauld. The story begins as Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting Fazz.
	As you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long however and the slider will return to the beginning.

game: Hot Wheels: Turbo Racing
file: ./Hot Wheels - Turbo Racing (USA).chd
description:
	Mattel's Hot Wheels has been one of the most popular toy franchises for boys and girls for over 30 years, on the same glorified popularity level as G.I. Joe and Barbie. Now get ready for pulse-pounding racing action as these die-cast race cars come to life on the PlayStation in Hot Wheels Turbo Racing. Developed by Stormfront Studios and published by Electronic Arts, the game features 11 twisting tracks and plenty of stunts like flips, barrel rolls and 360-degree spins.
	Get behind the wheel of over 40 classic Hot Wheels cars including The Red Baron, Twin Mill (The King of Speed) and Super Van (5,000 pounds of car-smashing terror). Each car has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you'll have to experiment to find out which one is best suited to your driving style. You'll have your choice of many different tracks, some built for all out speed and others filled with loops and obstacles to challenge your stunt mastery.
	The gameplay consists of three different race modes and two practice modes. Perfect your style in the Practice mode, where one or two players try out available tracks to get familiar with the game (and to find hidden short cuts). You can also select Practice Airtime, which is a stunt training mode that allows you to try out different tracks to perfect your stunt and trick maneuvers. Then earn points in the Exhibition Race where you go head-to-head with a friend or a number of computer-controlled opponents in an all-out race. This includes Airtime Challenge, a one or two-player stunt battle, and the Hot Wheels Cup, which is a racing tournament event made up of a series of tracks. The better you perform in each race the more points you'll score. The driver with the most points at the end of the tournament will win.
	The game's tracks feature hidden cars, shortcuts and power-ups at various points along the courses. Power-ups include a Car of Steel that gives your vehicle maximum durability, spin-increasing Gyros that make stunt maneuvering easier, the bouncy Rubber Car, the power, handling and grip increasing Super Handling, Turbo Boosts and the 4X4 pickup that allows you to go off-road.
	Turbo Boosts play an important role in the game. This power allows you to blow away your opponents with an incredible boost of speed in addition to increasing your airtime for pulling off more impressive stunts. As you collect Turbo Boosts throughout the game, they will register on your onscreen Turbo Meter. You must use this power cautiously and at the right time to help you score points and win the race!
	Hot Wheels Turbo Racing uses one block of memory for saved games and is vibration function and analog control compatible. In-game options include adjustable difficulty levels, custom control configurations and the ability to change musical selections. The soundtrack offers musical tracks by actual bands such as Metallica's Fuel, Primus' Hampster Style, Mix Master Mike's Outee 360 and The Reverend Horton Heat's Pride of San Jacinto.
	Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines. The race is about to begin!

	While no special modes of play exist, there are tracks and boats to be unlocked. Hydro Thunder allows players access to three boats and three tracks at the start of the game. New boats will be released depending on your finish on each of the three tracks. A player must finish in one of the top three positions on each track for new boats to become available. Boats each have their own advantages in areas such as control, stability, and speed.
	Tracks are released in the same way as boats. A top three finish in each of the first three available tracks is needed in order to unlock new tracks. On the new tracks a top two finish will be required and so on. No difficulty settings are featured in Hydro Thunder but when new tracks are released they will contain an increased difficulty level. The first three tracks are considered easy, the next three medium, and the three after that hard.

	In Cold Blood requires players to use more brains than brawn in solving a case of international intrigue, puzzle-solving, clue gathering, and the unwinding of a tangled web of espionage, double-crosses and a sinister plot that might threaten the free world. The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is in the midst of a grueling interrogation. The scenes from the game come from his memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more sense.
	.
	Throughout In Cold Blood, players will have to search for hidden objects and talk to a whole host of characters, attempting at every turn to solve the puzzles that pop up in their way. But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents. Occasionally, the player can outwit the enemies, but they'll often they'll have to fight it out in a duel to the death.

game: Incredible Crisis
file: ./Incredible Crisis (USA).chd
description:
	Incredible Crisis follows the stories of four members of a Japanese family on their grandmother's birthday. As each family member goes through a seemingly normal day, things start to go wrong -- very wrong. Players will be able to live out this family's hair-raising experiences by playing a series of mini-games.
	At its core, Incredible Crisis is a collection of mini-games strung together in order to advance the plot. Games range from a beatmania-style of timed gameplay (where certain buttons are pressed during certain beats) to shooting down airplanes, attacking UFOs, and even a certain "massage" level that is so analogous to a sexual experience that if gamers only heard the instructions and game mechanics, they would swear they were playing a game rated A for adult.

	Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Crazy Maze isn't the type of game one would expect when taking on the role of the bumbling, multi-functional detective of the 1980's cartoon. Rather than an action title like its Game Boy Color counterpart, this incarnation of Inspector Gadget is best described as a puzzle game with limited action elements.
	.
	According to the story of Gadget's Crazy Maze, Inspector Gadget's mysterious arch-nemesis is up to no good once again. This time, the MADD ringleader Dr. Claw has been creating mind-control crystals on his secret moon base, then tossing them down to Earth. If the crystals lay dormant for a short amount of time, they will activate, taking control of the consciousness of the whole world. To make sure no one disturbs them, Dr. Claw has spread them all around four different areas and inserted his vile henchmen to protect them.

game: IK+
file: ./International Karate + (Europe).chd
description:
	Based on the all time classic Commodore 64/128 game by Archer MacLean.
	International Karate + is a 2D karate fighting game, but with three combatants instead of two. Taking control of one of the three karate experts, players must fight against the other two in timed rounds. The other two karate experts are fighting against each other as well, creating a three way fight situation.
	Each fighter starts with an empty gauge that can record up to five points. Every time a fighter makes a successful attack on either of the two other fighters he earns a point in his gauge, as well as a score depending on the technique. The first fighter to get five full points is the winner of the round, but the fighter with the second highest point total can continue to fight in the next round. If none of the fighters are able to score five points before the timer runs down then the two fighters with the highest point totals move on to the next round, while the third fighter is dropped. In the case of a point tie the fighter with the higher cumulative score is the winner.
	Between rounds players can engage in a mini-game which involves holding a shield and deflecting balls bouncing into the screen from both directions. Players can hold the shield facing either direction and at one of three heights. The goal is to deflect as many balls as possible without letting one slip through.

description:
	Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale is a 2D fighting game starring characters from Rumiko Takahashi's manga and anim? series, Inuyasha. The story centers around 15-year old high school student Kagome Higure, who inadvertently slips back in time to feudal Japan, where she becomes embroiled in a quest to locate shards of the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. "Feudal Fairy Tale," the game's main mode of play, follows this escapade and requires players to engage in a series of battles and mini-games in order to obtain the coveted shards. Initially, only Kagome and her half-demon companion Inuyasha are playable, but as players journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available.
	Each character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when the Spiritual meter is filled. Additionally, specific attacks can cause opponents to drop shards that, once claimed, will fill the Spiritual meter more quickly.

All three of these are shooters where the player controls a ship "looking down" and long tunnel or tube and the player can move around inside the cylinder, shooting enemies that it runs to while moving. I will make most of my comparisons to N20 because it is apparent that the two games have a lot of similarities.

description:
	Jackie Chan's grandfather has been kidnapped and it is up to you to help save him! Midway's action-platform game, Jackie Chan Stuntmaster lets you experience some of what it takes to be the internationally known martial arts actor and stunt performer. You'll play as Jackie Chan himself from a third-person perspective as you cheat death through 15 levels set within a dangerous city full of thugs. Along the way, you'll also need to retrieve a stolen package from a gang of crooks.
	.
	The crime element is not the only thing you have to deal with -- you'll also cross narrow ledges, avoid obstacles and pitfalls, and even fight on top of a speeding subway train. To accomplish these feats, you must learn how to punch, kick, jump, grab and throw multiple opponents. You also need to climb ladders, open doors, pick up objects (using some as weapons), and hang on ledges or jump off walls. Sound familiar?
	.
	In addition to the ability to push around objects, you can flip tables and chairs, causing damage to nearby enemies. Other pick-ups let your character heal (rice, milk or take-out-boxes) while others are important for your quest (red and gold dragons and extra takes). Keep in mind that some are hidden beneath boxes, crates and potted-plants that you'll need to break.

During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.

It's time for the toughest lawman of them all to move in and dispense justice via his Lawgiver gun.
	.
	Judge Dredd for the PlayStation is an 'on rails' lightgun shooter based on the original comics instead of the 1995 movie. The action moves through pre-rendered environments on a fixed path. 14 levels spread over 4 stages must be cleared of lawbreakers.
	.
	Most enemies are polygonal 3D models overlaid over the video backdrop, but the background can also be shot at: gun turrets and some bosses like hovertanks and other heavy machinery are pre-rendered objects. Powerups are hidden in the scenery as well: there are different ammunition types for the Lawgiver, including rapid fire and heat-seekers. Also available are medikits, extra lives and rockets which can clear the screen of enemies.
	.
	Not everything on the screen should be shot at, however: sometimes, innocent citizens will cross the scene. Hitting too many of them means a quick 'game over'.
	.
	The storyline of the game is told between levels via live-action cutscenes.

game: Juggernaut
file: ./Juggernaut (USA).m3u
description:
	Juggernaut is a slow-paced, point-and-click adventure in the same vein as the PC title Myst. It tells the story of a young woman named Sarah who, after having received an antique bottle as a gift from her boyfriend, opens it only to be consumed by an enigmatic, evil force. Having inadvertently caused her plight, players assume the role of her boyfriend who, aided by a priest, must venture into her mind, defeat the being that now resides there, and ultimately, save her soul.
	The gist of the gameplay consists of moving about a series of static screens, collecting items and objects for later use, and solving puzzles in order to progress further into the game. An onscreen compass allows players to determine in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad. If the scene contains any interactive elements, a cursor is displayed that can be moved about the environment, allowing players to investigate or manipulate whatever they are.
	Exploring the recesses of Sarah's mind, players find themselves confronted with a variety of surreal, often disturbing images. The puzzles, too, are out of the ordinary, requiring players to find a corporeal entity for their spiritual essence so they may interact with objects; utilizing color and music to solve puzzles and the like. The title presents a host of puzzles that range in difficulty and scope, some requiring the use of acquired implements, while others demand logic.
	The most important item in your possession is the pendant from your girlfriend.You can use this at any time to save your game.
	Features:
	* Save your girlfriend Sarah from the Great Evil that possesses her
	* Acquire items that may be used to aid you in your quest
	* Solve an array of puzzles to advance further into the title

Baron may be an evil bad guy with a chemical imbalance, but he is no fool! He quickly got the heck out of dodge and made an ironic call for help; he called Robbit!

game: Kagero: Deception II
file: ./Kagero - Deception II (USA).chd
description:
	Enter a world where humans and creatures called Timenoids coexist. These blue-skinned Timenoids are determined to wipe out the inferior human race, and this is where you come in. You play the role of Millennia, a young woman who was brainwashed at an early age to do the Timenoids' bidding. She now believes that the humans must be exterminated from the world, which is rather ironic, since she is human herself. Yet if she succeeds, the Timenoids have promised her immortality and the power to become one of their own...
	In this sequel to Tecmo's Deception, you are once again placed inside a castle to lure invaders into various traps. The game differs from the original in several ways, however. The view is no longer first-person, so you can see your character at all times. Multiple traps can also be triggered at once (up to three), forming even deadlier combinations than the original. In addition, the vibration mode is supported on the Dual Shock Analog Controller to provide feedback on each gruesome death. Prepare for a non-linear journey as the decisions you make during the game affect the type of ending you'll receive. Maybe, just maybe, you'll remember your past...

After completing the daunting task that is Story mode, players will have an even better time competing in the game's primary Ranking mode. Here they must fight anywhere between three and 12 fighters to win the title belt and gain valuable experience points. After winning a title, they can then defend their title to gain more points or open up new championship tournaments. While there are no rewarding endings or additional special characters to be earned, Ranking Mode is enjoyable enough to bring players back again and again.

It is the sixth installment in the company's The King of Fighters series. The game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and the PlayStation as the final KOF game released for both platforms. A Dreamcast version was also released under the title The King of Fighters '99 Evolution in which the stages look exactly the same as compared with the arcade counterpart only to be exclusively, remodeled into 3D rendered. Both the Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are included in The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. The game introduces several changes to the established KOF format, as well as a new story arc that would later be dubbed the "NESTS Chronicles".
	PLOT:
	Two years have passed since the last King of Fighters tournament and nobody has seen Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami since they defeated Orochi at the climax of the 1997 tournament, but out of the blue, new invitations are sent out to many characters, inviting them to a brand new tournament, though this competition is more of a secretive affair than the ones in '96 and '97. Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.
	PLAYSTATION VERSION:
	The 1999 edition of the The King of Fighters series made the rounds from the arcade to the Neo Geo and Dreamcast before finding its way to the PlayStation console with this release. Players choose a team of three warriors and take on all challengers in this classically styled 2D fighter from the veterans at Agetec and SNK.
	Though based heavily on earlier versions of The King of Fighters '99, this PlayStation game adds new features designed to especially appeal to fans of the series, such as voice and picture galleries and a color edit mode that allows players to change the appearance of their favorite characters.
	Features:
	The King of Fighters '99 adds one new character to the roster of 32
	New to the series are Striker Matches where characters jump into matches to save teammates
	Gallery mode features a variety of artwork, demo animations and voice samples

description:
	Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a side-scrolling platform game viewed from a "2.5D" perspective. The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path. The game is divided into levels called "Visions", where the player progresses by following a path with defeatable computer-controlled enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.

game: Koudelka
file: ./Koudelka (USA).m3u
description:
	The premise behind Koudelka takes place in Aberyswyth, Wales at a monastery known as Nementon Abbey. Found in a remote location, the abbey was built as a place of worship, learning and teaching; it was a place where scholars found peace.
	As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

game: Krazy Ivan
file: ./Krazy Ivan (USA).chd
description:
	In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.
	.
	The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.
	.
	The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.
	.
	After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.
	.
	Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.

game: Langrisser IV & V: Final Edition
file: ./Langrisser IV (English v1.3).chd
description:
	Langrisser IV is the fourth in the long-running Japanese strategy RPG series.    Cleons, the king of the country Regenburg, offers his general Gizarov a reward for his achievements on the battle field. For a mysterious reason, Gizarov chooses only one small town, called Gotaal. Immediately after having the town in his possession, Gizarov presses the population with heavy taxes. Landius, the son of Gotaal's mayor, fails to convince Gizarov to stop raising the taxes, and as a result, he has no other choice but to support the people in rebellion...    The game returns to the traditional gameplay style of the first two Langrisser games. You create your character and choose his class by answering questions in the beginning of the game (similar to Ultima games). Before the battles, you should recruit mercenaries, buy weapons and items, etc. Once in battle mode, you command several units led by stronger generals. Each unit has its own "judgment" ability"; units with high judgment ability will perform more moves during a turn.    The story of Langrisser V is closely connected to the one told in Langrisser IV - the two games form a kind of a sub-series within the Langrisser universe.     The game's plot revolves around Sigma, an artificial human created by the great warlock and scientist Gizarov. One say, Sigma is awakened from his sleep inside a storage crystal in one of Gizarov's labs by Lambda, a girl who was also created by the scientist. Apparently, a powerful lord named Rainforce has invaded Gizarov's laboratory with the intention of destroying it. Meanwhile, a powerful artificial human called Omega, another "child" of Gizarov, distracts Rainforce. The two heroes flee to Regenburg, a country under Gizarov's rule, only to find out that they will soon have to stop a greater evil endangering the world - a new leader of darkness, who is after the powerful evil sword Alhazard...    Langrisser V features classical Langrisser-style gameplay: you prepare your units before a battle, buy items etc., and in battle control various types of army units (archers, pikemen, etc.), together with the generals. The "Judgment System" from the previous game is back: your units can perform several moves per turn depending on their "judgment level". Like in Langrisser III, there is an element of "love simulation" in the game - at certain points you'll have to choose between various answers that will determine the further development of your relationship with the female party members.

description:
	Largo Winch, the "billionaire in blue jeans," is based on the character created by novelist Jean van Hamme, now popular in France in the form of comic strips and a television series. Much like Lara Croft and James Bond, the rich, sophisticated, tough, agile, and cunning Winch is thrust into situations that only a top commando could handle. In Largo Winch.// Commando SAR, players guide Largo on a quest to track down terrorists, who are threatening his financial empire, and rescue a young journalist, Tania Kournakova, who was kidnapped from his Venezuelan chemical factory.
	Members of the South American Redemption (SAR) have been blackmailed by a rival corporation and forced to commit acts against Largo's empire by the evil Mrs. Fritz. Now, Winch must use his fists, a pistol, and semi-retrievable (only if they miss the target) throwing knives in conjunction with gadgets like a brainwave scanner for locating enemies, a radio (for hints and messages from friends), and his toolkit. His arsenal, combined with stealthy movement, helps the jet-set commando put an end to the conspiracy facing him in his first PlayStation adventure.

game: Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver
file: ./Legacy of Kain - Soul Reaver (USA).chd
description:
	1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...
	.
	Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.
	.
	The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes  requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.

game: The Legend of Dragoon (LoDModS)
file: ./Legend of Dragoon, The (LoDModS v1.2).m3u
description:
	Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies. Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this, the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses, which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun as the past and future are about to collide...
	In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
	Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
	Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the rest of your combos and damage your fighter as a result.
	Arm yourself with a variety of weapons such as swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and hammers. Protect yourself with body armor, helmets and boots. Other items like bracelets, amulets or stones carry with them magical powers to enhance attacks or deflect the damage of an attack. Although your journey begins with only basic weapons, others can be purchased from merchants or found in chests. Changing and upgrading weapons for the entire party can be done via the in-game menu, however some weapons are specialized for particular warriors. There are also items that can heal or wage war and they too are won in battle, found in chests, or purchased from merchants.
	Although you start out as Dart, a brave and loyal warrior swordsman sworn to avenge his parents' death by the Black Monster, other party members you'll run into have their own unique story to tell. Saving the game is done wherever you find Save Points; the only requirement is that you must have at least two blocks of memory available on a memory card. This one-player game is also analog and vibration compatible and comes on four CDs.
	.
	Party members get full xp even when not in party instead of half when out of party.
	Inventory expansion.
	Encounter rate bugfix and half rate - This is actually closer to the western release encounter rate than normal option is (which is a restoration of JP rate which is super high).
	Restores the previously censored (in the west) blood from Rose's attacks.
	Restores Japanese audio for voice acting.

file: ./Legend of Legaia (USA).chd
description:
	After creating a massive world with vast oceans, landscapes and an infinite universe, God instituted human beings to keep his creation in order. Upon realization that man was mortally flawed with weaknesses and feelings, he created a mysterious force known as the Seru; these stone objects would aid humans in decisions and day to day functions. Worn as an apparel item, they granted the wearer many strengths and abilities ranging from the movement of heavy objects to flying capabilities. Thus, human life was made easier -- the Seru would forever obey their masters.
	And then the Mist arrived.
	Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's cultivated lands and destroyed a seemingly eternal bond with the Seru. Instead of loyally helping their masters, the mysterious stones turned against the humans; they became maniacal tools of evil, controlling minds and ruining innocent lives. The human existence was reduced tremendously with few survivors fleeing to uncharted territories. Perhaps the Mist wouldn't find them wherever they ran.

At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters.
	.
	The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.

game: Little Big Adventure
file: ./Little Big Adventure (Europe).chd
description:
	The game is set on Twinsun, a planet stabilized between two suns. The planet is divided into two hemispheres by a huge mountain range running along its equator. Both the two hemispheres and the mountain range can be visited, which gives the game a variety of landscapes, including desert and snow. The different locations are divided into small active scenes.
	The game has a total of 120 scenes to visit, and you are given very much freedom to do this. These scenes are viewed from a three dimensional isometric perspective. The characters in the game are mainly based on toys and animals. Four different species live on Twinsun: the Quetches, the Spheros, the Rabbibunnies and the Grobos. Quetches are humanoids with a pony tail right on top of their heads and Spheros have sphere like bodies. Rabbibunnies are rabbits walking on two legs and Grobos look like elephants. Characters of these species are spread all over the game. You need to talk and interact with them to receive hints or help on your quest.

game: Loaded
file: ./Loaded (USA).chd
description:
	Set against the backdrop of an inter-galactic penal colony, Loaded sees players, as one of six psychotic inmates, attempting to navigate fifteen enemy-laden levels en route to their ultimate goal; the killing of the sadistic warden -- known as FUB (Fat Ugly Boy) -- of said penal colony. The characters, with names such as Butch, FWANK, Cap N Hands, Mamma, Bounca, and Vox run the gamut from cross-dressing freaks and cyborg pirates to demented clowns and female cyber-criminals. All are rated in a handful of categories; each possessing differing speed, vitality and damage potential attributes. Armed with their character's weapon of choice, up to two players can blast their way through stages populated by fellow inmates, guards, straight-jacket laden mental patients, rats, and more. While objectives are present, the basic formula amounts to scouring each level in search of color-coded keys that will allow you to advance further into the level, while blasting hostiles and collecting ammunition and health power-ups to replenish your reserves. A small on-screen map allows you to find your way through the maze-like stages.

game: Looney Tunes Racing
file: ./Looney Tunes Racing (USA).chd
description:
	Looney Tunes Racing is a kart-racing game for the PlayStation. There are some definite similarities between this title and Crash Team Racing, both in game play mechanics and depth. Completely immersed in the humor and soul of the Looney Tunes license, the player starts the game with only a handful of characters and levels available, but as the game proceeds features become unlocked including new characters, levels, and challenges.
	.
	Each character has an unique vehicle themed just for them, and is accompanied by voice taunts, provided by Warner Bros. licensed voice actors, and character-specific animations that help bring these characters to life.
	.
	The weapons the player can unleash onto the opponents include cherry bombs, homing cream pies, thunder clouds with devastating lightning bolts, and giant anvils that drop out of the sky. In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer, the large monster make entirely of red hair (except for those big white eyes and white tennis shoes), makes a cameo in the Gossamer’s castle level, as he comes right out onto the track to take out any oncoming traffic.
	.
	Beyond the races, other noteworthy game modes include the Multi-player Battle Mode, where the players basically pummel each other with wacky weaponry, and the ACME Challenges, which include challenges such as Boss Races (against Porky Pig, for example), picking up key items in a certain order, and others.

description:
	The Lost World: Jurassic Park is a 3D action video game released in 1997 for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation. Developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is based on both the novel by Michael Crichton and Steven Spielbergâ€™s film The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A year later a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a part of their Greatest Hits line-up and featured several modifications to the game play.
	.
	The player takes control of characters struggling to survive on INGenâ€™s â€œSite Bâ€  populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. While the game is in 3D, the game play resembles early 2D platformers in which you generically either go left or right, limiting the mobility of each character.

game: LSD: Dream Emulator
file: ./LSD - Dream Emulator (Japan) (English v1).chd
description:
	In LSD the player navigates through a psychedelic dream world. The idea is simply to walk around and explore things in a dream environment. There are many strange environments in this world, and one way to travel through them is by foot. However, if the player bumps into walls or other objects in the game, they will be transported to another environment instantaneously through a system called "linking". Bumping into people, animals, or special objects usually results in a stranger dream.
	.
	Each dream can last up to 10 minutes, after which the player will 'wake up', when the screen fades away and the player is sent back to the game's initial menu. However, if the player falls off a cliff or into a hole in the dream, then the player will wake up immediately. There is a graph that appears at the end of each dream that keeps track of the player's state of mind; the states are Upper, Downer, Static and Dynamic, as referring to the environments and the general feel of the dream the player just went through. Past states may have effects on later dreams.

	You, as Lucky Luke, have to stop the Dalton gang from making another crime. Walking around town you have to solve puzzles, shoot criminals and collect money. After finishing the level you have a chance to buy an extra life with the money collected. Shooting isn't ordinary, often Lucky needs to ricochet shots to hit his target. The game view sometimes changes from 2D style to behind the shoulders. The levels differ from town exploring, to bottle-shooting in a bar, to freeing hostages on the roof of train, to Indian sneaking. But, all of them lead Lucky to $1,000,000 for the capture of the Daltons.

game: Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete (Un-Worked Design)
file: ./Lunar - Silver Star Story Complete (Un-Worked Design).m3u
description:
	Lunar: Silver Star Story was originally released on the Sega CD. In its time, it was one of the most cherished role-playing games and reaped in massive critical acclaim from reviewers and players alike. Due to space limitations, Working Designs were forced to restrain some things they wanted in the game. Because it is the company's favorite game, they decided to release Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete on the PlayStation -- an uncut version. It is said that this is the way they had always envisioned it.
	.
	This is a patch that fixes many issues introduced in the US version of the PlayStation game Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete by its publisher, Working Designs. The US release of the game heavily tampers with the enemy stats, decreases the amount of money and experience earned in battles and on the overworld, and makes several other frustrating changes to gameplay. This patch aims to restore the gameplay to match the original Japanese version.

description:
	Lunar 2: Eternal Blue is a traditional role-playing video game featuring two-dimensional character sprites and backgrounds. The game is presented from a top-down perspective with players moving the characters across numerous fantasy environments while completing story-based scenarios and battling enemy monsters. While basic game function remains similar to Lunar: The Silver Star, with story segments being presented as both on-screen text and animated cutscenes, the abundance of these interludes has been increased to over fifty minutes of movie content and an hour of spoken dialogue. Players advance the story by taking part in quests and interacting with non-player characters, which engages them in the story as well as providing tips on how to advance.
	.
	This is a patch that fixes a few issues introduced in the US version of the PlayStation game Lunar 2: Eternal Blue Complete by its publisher, Working Designs.
	Unlike the rest of the Lunar series and the vast majority of Working Designs releases, the PlayStation Lunar 2 doesn't appear to have had its difficulty altered in any meaningful way for the US release, so this patch just tidies up a few needless changes.

If it was ever needed, the government could set up shop on the surface of Mars and transport humans to live in colonies or bring back valuable resources to Earth.
	By the year 2034, Earth has finally run out of resources and machines have been set to Mars in an attempt to mine it. The machines were given synthetic brains with simple artificial intelligence and without any defensive mechanisms or assault weaponry. This proved to be very costly to the human race, since aliens have landed on the planet and are taking over the robots.

description:
	The "2005" edition of the best-selling Madden NFL sports game series hits the field with another new season's worth of refinements and additions. Attention has been paid to the defensive game in this version, with enhancements intended to give gamers more options and more control when they're playing from the other side of the football. Many of this year's new features involve the NFL players themselves, however, calling upon gamers to maintain and develop their star athletes. Players are now rewarded for their good performances throughout the season, and individuals can be affected by the ebb and flow of morale.
	Madden 2005 offers "hit stick," control, which allows the right analog stick to be used to perform the kind of huge, momentum-shifting hits that fans will hear way up in the nosebleed section. Risks are involved, however, and players who miss tackles under the hit stick system's less rigid controls have only themselves to blame. Gamers can also involve themselves more deeply in defensive strategy than they could in earlier versions of Madden NFL. The new Defensive Playmaker Control system allows them to modify assignments for any player on the field, to set up blitzes, jams, and individual man-to-man coverage, right up until the moment the ball is snapped.

To achieve victory, the player must cast spells against his opponent, which take the form of creatures and energy that will attack the player's adversary. At the same time, the player's rival is also casting spells, in an effort to destroy the player's planeswalker.
	The spells at the player's disposal are drawn from the Magic collectible card game, from their 4th edition and Mirage sets. These spells are depicted by icons intended to "represent" each spell, which must be identified in order that the player cast the spell intended.

	Magic Carpet is a very original title. Flying on a carpet itself is original in video games,but the concept and story line make this one of a kind.
	Collect magical powers by shooting the balls (mana) floating around the world and make them your color (white). Then, let your hot air balloons pick them up and bring them to your castle before the other wizards get to your mana and change it to their own color. That's the main thing of the game.
	All of the 13 different beasts that fly or walk around in each of the worlds contain a certain amount of mana, and when destroyed, it's released. You complete a world (there's about 75 of them!) when a certain amount of mana has been stored in your castle.
	A really interesting aspect of mana is that you can access more spells the more you get,there are 20 different spells that can be found in the game.

	You'll also have the ability to create your very own players, modify rosters, call plays on the fly and use the give-and-go to outmaneuver your opponent. You can also make substitutions for tired or fouled-out players and check their statistics during the game.
	While taking your team through an entire 1997-98 season with a schedule of thirty games, make sure you call the right offensive and defensive formations if you want a shot at winning them. The Exhibition mode is the way to go for single match-ups and practicing control setups. If you're feeling game, take on the Tourney mode -- a 64 team NCAA Championship Tournament!

A dozen years later, NASA's analysis is complete and the existence of alien microfossils confirmed. In 2009, a manned mission to Mars to investigate bacterial life is launched with the establishment of the Vita 1 base the result.
	And now, in 2018, all communication with the base has been terminated. Vita 1's last message is the enigmatic: "If you send a manned craft, warn the crew to stay alone, stay alive." Nearly a year later, a team sent to investigate survives a crash on the Martian surface and arrives at the derelict base. Following the advice of the last message from Vita 1, each member enters the base through a separate airlock.

These can be activated during a fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a rift in space, or reverse the opponent's controls.

	With little in the way of story elements, Mass Destruction's title alone tells you exactly what this game is about. Played throughout a scorched Earth, you'll shoot anything and everything in your path as you control one of three available tanks. Each tank has different armor and speed statistics: the Cheetah is a speedy tank built for hit and run operations; the Cobra lacks maneuverability but has highly destructive capabilities; and the Viper is an able firehouse without the armor capabilities of the Cobra.
	Regardless of which tank you've chosen, they all begin with a 100mm Cannon and a chain gun. Among the various weapons you'll encounter are hi-explosive shells that explode on contact, mines, mortars, Torus Bombs that surround the tank with an explosion ring, flamethrowers and guided missiles.

description:
	Master of Monsters: Disciples of Gaia is a little know turn based strategy RPG game for the PlayStation. One of the main reasons it’s ‘little known’ is because the retail game shipped with game-breaking bugs making it frustrating if not unplayable.
	.
	Specifically a broken random number generator and a crash when the player reached level 100. This patch fixes those issues.
	.
	Gameplay offers single player and multi-player ‘versus’ mode and consists of summoning monsters for battle and capturing territory to gain resources. Though the graphics and menus are a bit ‘clunky’ for a PS1 era game, it can offer some decent entertainment value for strategy enthusiasts.

game: Maximum Force
file: ./Maximum Force (USA).chd
description:
	Maximum Force is a lightgun game for one or two players. As top counter-terrorism agents, you and a partner have three missions to complete to eradicate the world of a band of evil terrorists.
	Each mission set in radically different locations and is divided into three stages. After each stage you and your partner are rated in terms of accuracy, number of kills, number of streaks (consecutive hits), total shots fired, amount of damage done, and your total score. The third mission can be played only when the first two have been completed.
	Per standard shooting games, you must try to kill the terrorists and spare the innocents. There are power-ups to shoot that will increase your firepower to shotgun or machine gun level.
	Not standard to many shooting games however is the encouragement the Maximum Force presents to do physical damage to your surroundings. Most everything in the game is shootable and will show damage when shot. Windows may be shot out, flower pots shatter, etc. Hitting certain items will start mini-games within the game, such as a duck-shooting gallery or a shark hunt. These mini-games serve to increase your score.
	The look of the game is somewhat reminiscent of Lethal Enforcers, except the camera is much more fluid. You will frequently change camera positionsand find yourself shooting at targets on the fly. An almost identical game to Maximum Force in terms of look and game play is Area 51.

	Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes.

	MechWarrior 2 gives you the chance to participate in the Clan Refusal War, a bloody civil war between the Clans that occurs after the Battle of Tukayyid. The Crusaders, led by Clan Jade Falcon, seek to launch another attack into the Inner Sphere. The Warden faction, led by Clan Wolf, believe that coexistence with the Inner Sphere is the best choice. The war will ultimately dictate which faction dominates the Clans.
	You can play as either a Clan Jade Falcon or Clan Wolf MechWarrior and command a range of mechs ranging from light scout to heavy 100 ton assault mechs. Before missions, each player can select one or more mechs for his or her unit as well as customize equipment and weaponry. Although there is no restriction to stop you from taking the maximum number and tonnage complement, the Clans reward players who take fewer mechs or less tonnage than allowed.
	The game's 3D world is viewed from a first-person perspective. Mission objectives must be completed while evading or destroying enemy mechs. During missions, each player must manage their mechs' heat level and ammunition, as well as command the CPU-controlled friendly mechs to organize strategy. Missions end in failure if the objective is lost or if mechs are destroyed through damage or overheating.

file: ./MediEvil II (USA).chd
description:
	16, May 1886
	There will be many stories concerning the events that took place in 1886 or as most have come to call it, the Autumn of Death. They have all been dismissed as mere hallucinations, the prattling of drunks or some stage of a sickness. I know better. I was there.
	That night the dead rose from the graves, demons stalked the Great Museum and even mummies walked among the living. Everyone saw a skeletal knight vanquishing all the horrid beasts. I spoke to him. I even aided him in his quest to destroy Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. It's all true. Every word of it! Below is what I was able to uncover about our knight in placid bone. Read closely and heed my words.
	I found an old legend about a mighty knight, whose name I now know to be Sir Daniel Fortesque, that starts around the 13th century. He was a mighty warrior from the land of Gallowmere, now too a legend. He was slain in battle against the insane wizard, Zarok. Unfortunately, Sir Dan's death was for nothing. Zarok lived on and soon came into possession of a book of dark magic.
	Several years passed before Zarok finally deciphered the spell he was looking for. It is written that with this book of dark magic, Zarok awoke the dead to use them in an army. He was delighted and mad with power, so mad that he never realized that the spell worked all too well.
	As the legend goes, Sir Dan arose from his eternal sleep and took up the task he died trying to complete. After defeating all the roving minions of the damned and dead, he finally met Zarok face to face. It was an epic battle of might and magic but in the end, Sir Dan completed his knightly quest started several years before. With Zarok dead, Sir Dan hid the magic book and returned to his eternal rest.
	Now, some 500 years later, I witnessed Sir Dan awaken again. This time it was by the megalomaniac Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. He was a man from the wrong side of the rails. He even bought a title to make himself feel more important. However, the society elite never really excepted him. That is when he turned to the book of dark magic and cast a spell to raise the dead. He wanted to destroy all of England and become its sole ruler.
	At first sight of Sir Dan I was sick to my stomach. One eye, no skin, he was hideous and a bit angry. I felt badly for Sir Dan, but I was extremely excited by the prospect of having him on my side. Being an older gentleman, I was not fit enough to do battle. My expertise is in the sciences and I know a bit of magic.
	Once this was all over, I bade Sir Dan farewell. I pray I never get to see him again in my lifetime. I pray that my ancestors will never have to see him in theirs. I knew they would deny it all. I can only pray that who so ever finds this believes me. I know not where Sir Dan placed the accursed book and that is probably for the best. I only hope its evil is gone for good. Believe in monsters, it may save us all some day.
	-- From the Private Diaries of Professor Hamilton Kift
	In Medievil II by Sony, you once again you play as Sir Dan. This time, instead of facing a mad sorcerer from your day, you must take on the modern world, modern 19th century that is. Using all the weapons at your disposal, you must help Professor Hamilton as he tries to figure out how to undo the damage being done by Lord Palethorn.
	Along the way, you will meet a helper ghost named Winston. He was raised by the kindly Professor and will give you tips from time to time. You must also collect treasure, keys and books to help in your quest. You'll need to buy certain items and ammo as well as read up on the enemy.
	There are, of course, the standard medieval weaponry like the sword, hammer and axe, along with different sizes of shields. There is also one modern weapon, the gatling gun. Along with the weapons you find, be sure to vanquish all your enemies and get the Chalice of Souls. Bringing this cup back to the Professor will prove to be very beneficial to Sir Dan.
	You also get to do things only the dead can do. Like putting your head on some of the creepy free-roaming hands that are moving about the Great Museum. Why would you want to do that? Why, to do some recon and get into those hard to reach places of course. Without revealing too much, your head will be placed on another body by the good Professor so you can stand a "fighting" chance against a certain enemy.

Reploids were sent in to terraform the land in an attempt to make the planet habitable for humans once more, however, a Reploid and former colleague of Alia named Gate discovered something unusual amidst the ruins of Earth — a piece of Zero's DNA. After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes, much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero. X, along with the Maverick Hunters, must confront the Nightmare Investigators as they try to solve the mystery behind the Nightmare Phenomenon and clear Zero's name.

game: Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions
file: ./Metal Gear Solid VR Missions (USA).chd
description:
	A semi-sequel/prequel to the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid (MGS), Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions puts you once again in control of the top-level FoxHound field specialist, Solid Snake. This time around, instead of fighting genetically engineered soldiers and saving the world from Metal Gear, you're in a combat simulator. Aboard the Discovery (the submarine that Solid Snake traveled upon before reaching Angel Island), you will prepare for the dangers ahead.
	.
	For those that have yet to experience MGS, the gameplay is based around strategy, tactics and action. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions's interface and concept is similar to its predecessor, but is based on the simulator game mode that was included in MGS. This time, instead of just a few missions, you have nearly 150 different stages to play (300 including the Time Attack modes). Fans of MGS should be able to quickly pick up on the gameplay style. In fact, not only is the gameplay recognizable by fans of the original Metal Gear Solid, each of the missions (although similarities are sometimes minute) are based on events that occurred in MGS.

game: Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout
file: ./Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout (USA).chd
description:
	Tecmo expands its Monster Rancher line with Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout for the PlayStation. This game is a fast-paced platform jumper in which players race their bouncing characters through extraordinary obstacle courses. Along the way there are several panels which can provide all sorts of power-ups to the characters that find them.
	The game features a versus mode, in which two players can race side by side through the same course. To provide further replay value, the game also comes with a level editor that allows players to design their own Monster Rancher courses.
	When a player steers a monster in a certain direction, it will continue moving in that direction instead of straightening its path or stopping. To change the speed and height of their jumps, players must land on special squares. Only the controller's directional pad is used during the game, no buttons.
	Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout becomes challenging quickly, especially after the first ten rounds. There are generally multiple ways to complete each round, some of which are noticeably easier. At first the special squares that propel players forward earn them additional time and so forth are helpful in raising scores and adding to the game's enjoyment, but by level 16 it's necessary to hit them just to clear levels.
	Features:
	* Over 50 challenging stages riddled with obstacle courses
	* Choose from a number of Monster Rancher characters including Hare, Golem, and Mocchi
	* Create your own fun stages

description:
	In Monsterseed, players assume the role of Daniel, a young "ruler" who begins the game by getting himself beaten unconscious, but is rescued by the lovely Kal and her rugged grandfather, Wolf. Daniel learns that the thugs who attacked him are part of an evil gang terrorizing his benefactors' little town. The gang's leader Murdoch is collecting ancient statues to open a gateway to the Dark World, hoping to resurrect an immensely powerful monster. Driven by a sense of duty to repay and protect Wolf and Kal, Daniel pursues Murdoch through labyrinthine mines and ruins, a booby-trapped mansion, and even through the Dark World itself, fighting wild monsters and collecting monster seeds along the way.
	At first Daniel buys his monsters at the town hatchery, but as the game progresses, he obtains increasingly potent seeds to hatch on his own. By adjusting hatching temperatures, different monsters can be produced from each seed. Daniel can also add solutions to a seed during hatching to boost certain characteristics of his monsters.
	Monsters have several characteristics affecting their behavior. For example, willpower indicates how determined a monster is in battle; an "unforgiving" monster is quick to enter battle, while a "cowardly" one may ignore Daniel's commands or even beg to be recalled. Response time indicates how quickly a monster will materialize after being summoned; a "quite slow" monster may not materialize for several rounds after Daniel has summoned it, but a "quite fast" monster responds immediately.

game: Mortal Kombat: Special Forces
file: ./Mortal Kombat - Special Forces (USA).chd
description:
	Why do people hate? What causes such intense animosity that a person would go to any length to hurt someone, perhaps even destroy them? These are just a few questions posed by the relationship of Jax and Kano.
	Is it because Jax is a Special Forces agent and must bring Kano to justice? Could it be that simple? Would it justify following him to another realm and becoming involved in the Mortal Kombat competition? Can hate make you so blind that you'd face demons in hopes of facing the one man you truly want to destroy?
	Greater yet is the mystery of how Kano became involved with Shang Tsung and the significance of the Black Dragon. So many questions left unanswered, so many things seemingly left to chance. At least until now...
	In Mortal Kombat Special Forces by Midway, you play as Jax. Your mission is to destroy Kano and his army of thugs, but it won't be easy. You have to explore 3D environments from a third-person perspective and find hidden areas. Punch, kick, and shoot your way through the droves of enemies you'll face. Watch out for thugs armed with guns and other weapons trying to snuff out your life before you can get to your true objective.
	Be sure to pay close attention to incoming messages. They will give hints and help you solve the riddle of hate. They may even lead you to some secret places too. Collect items and weapons in order to increase your firepower and fill your health meter -- there is even a sniper rifle for some long distance attacks. Amass experience points and learn new and devastating combo moves. Pull off one of those combos at the right time, and witness a gruesome fatality.
	Can you overcome your hatred? Or will you be another fatality?

game: Mortal Kombat 3
file: ./Mortal Kombat 3 (USA).chd
description:
	Unclear as to what happened at the end of Mortal Kombat II? The answer is: more Komabt! Mortal Kombat 3 is the third gruesome installment of the game infuriating congressmen everywhere. After the Kombatants lost the second tournament in Outworld, alternate-dimensional home of baddie Shao Kahn and his sorcerer Shang Tsung, Kahn decided to take over the Earth like any steroid-poppin' supervillian would. Conquering the souls of all but a few select Earthlings, Kahn prepares warriors of his own to meet the likes of Liu Kang and Sub-Zero head on.
	You control 14 selectable fighters (and one hidden one) with the standard two-punch, two-kick, and block buttons, plus a new feature, the run button. MK3 also adds multi-hit combos and level-ascension (basically, you punch a guy through the ceiling and he ends up on another screen) to the MK mythos, rounding out a fine bloodbath for any Playstation owner.

description:
	Mortal Kombat II plays similarly to Mortal Kombat, but features a number of improvements, including more graphical detail, better sound effects, faster (as well as harder) gameplay, smoother animation and more characters (including a playable Shang Tsung).
	Naturally, the game is violent and includes the notorious Fatality moves, but "Babalities" and "Friendships" were added to appease (actually, to poke fun at) citizens groups concerned with the series' high level of blood and gore. These kinder, gentler finishing moves include such things as turning your opponent into a baby and giving him or her a bouquet of flowers.

game: Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero
file: ./Mortal Kombat Mythologies - Sub-Zero (USA).chd
description:
	Midway decided to do something a little different with its Mortal Kombat franchise. They decided rather than to make a whole new MK game, they'd make a game that focused on one particular character from the popular series; a mini MK if you will. They'd shine some light on his past and present gamers with a story, rather than mindless fights to win a tournament. The character of choice is Sub Zero, and the game is aptly titled Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub Zero.
	Mythologies remains true to its parent series (up until Mortal Kombat 4, anyway) in a few aspects: all the characters are digitized and the game is still 2D. But unlike the other games in the series, this one's a platform adventure. You're not just fighting to win a tournament, you're fighting to find out the entire back story of Sub Zero. Sure, you'll still be beating up lots of bad guys, but the game is basically a "jump from platform to platform" game. Midway even throws in some RPG elements, such as item collection and a menu screen, to spice things up a bit.
	Features:
	* Explore eight distinct worlds while battling more than 30 enemies
	* Perform ice blasts, super slides, polar blasts, and more
	* Defeat a total of 12 boss characters, including Scorpion, Quan Chi, and Shinnok

description:
	Pac-Land is protected by the four gems of virtue: Generosity, Truth, Wisdom, and Courage. These four gems are scattered in the four Wonders of Pac-Land, mystical regions separated from Pac-Land by mysterious force fields. The gems are in place to keep darkness and chaos from falling on Pac-Land.
	Recently, someone has invaded the Enchanted Castle, kidnapping the princess and turning it into a haunted house. Professor Pac believes that whoever is responsible for that attack is planning to attack the rest of the four Wonders. Therefore, he has created a device that allows for someone to pass through the force field separating Pac-Land from the wonders. With this device you, Ms. Pac-Man, must recover the four gems and save Pac-Land.
	Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness is a 3D isometric view action puzzle game. You play as Ms. Pac-Man and must navigate the mazes while avoiding the monsters. Every time a monster touches or hits you part of your health bar is lost, and if you lose your entire health bar the game is over. If you eat a power dot you will be invincible for a short period of time, and can even eat the monsters.
	The game is composed of a series of theme levels, with each level having four gold stars to collect. You can collect a gold star by completing the level, eating all of the dots in the level, eating all seven hidden fruit in the level, or completing the level's time trial. These stars can then be used to unlock the game's secrets. The original Ms. Pac-Man arcade game is also included on the disc.

game: The Mummy
file: ./Mummy, The (USA).chd
description:
	Dashing explorer Rick O'Conell has just made a bit of a mistake. In discovering the lost City of the Dead, he's awakened an all-powerful evil known as Imhotep, a cursed priest who was mummified alive in ancient Egypt and is now, as one might imagine, hankering for revenge.
	It will take all of Rick's brains and brawn to make it through the coming ordeal, as he'll have to survive the Mummy's traps and vile legions if he hopes to make it out of the City of the Dead alive. As if that wasn't enough, he'll also have to take on the Mummy itself.
	Based on the 1999 summer blockbuster starring Brendan Frasier, you take on the role of Rick as he swashbuckles his way through this third-person action game, running, jumping and mainly fighting his way to the greater depths and secrets of the lost city.
	Throughout this action-adventure game, players will have to fight off all manner of supernatural beasts, from deadly mummies to scarabs, spirits and hordes of man-eating bugs. But fighting isn't the only task you'll be forced to encounter, as the City of the Dead is laced with all manners of traps and puzzles, each waiting for you to make the one mistake that will see you swallowed whole by the infinite dust of time.
	You won't be going in empty-handed if you take on the hefty task, thankfully, as Rick has a veritable arsenal at his disposal, representing many of the guns and weapons that were used in the movie, from swords to revolvers, and even to magical amulet grenades.
	Pure action isn't the only item on The Mummy's menu, however, as you will occasionally undertake certain objectives with their own unique viewpoints and controls, such as running for your life in a side-scrolling portion. Also included on The Mummy is a trailer for its theatrical sequel, The Mummy Returns.

game: Muppet Monster Adventure
file: ./Muppet Monster Adventure (USA).chd
description:
	Muppet Monster Adventure is a action platform game, best compared with Spyro but with Muppet characters and a Halloween or ghost house setting.
	.
	The story starts with the Muppets attending the reading of Dr. Honeydew recently deceased uncle's will. Instead of going on a holiday to a tropical resort, Robin and the others find themselves at a rundown, creepy castle. Upon arriving Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy and others are captured and now it's up to young Robin (Kermit's nephew) to save the day.
	.
	The gameplay is best described as a collect-and-explore-em-up. You have to explore all the vast areas and collect gems and tokens. The HUD displays how much you have collected in a certain level. To get 100% you really have to find every corner and figure out how to get onto the hard to reach platforms.
	.
	In the first few levels, Robin gains four special powers by collecting special Muppet coins. When all coins of a group are collected, Robin can morph into different types of monsters at certain places. An icon will appear in the top right-hand corner, indicating that you can use this special ability. You can fly or float, climb certain walls, do a karate chop to break obstacles, or gain extra strength to push objects.
	.
	There are lots of large areas to explore. After every few levels the setting is changed. You go from the castle courtyards to large underwater sections, from Arabian nights setting to icy snow levels. During the game, Pepe the King Prawn appears in lots of places to give you gameplay advice. In each level, there also are a lot of mini games to be found, such as a race against an computer opponent to get to a certain location.

description:
	You can race on a variety of courses, from twenty three real world Winston Cup courses, twelve road courses and eleven fantasy courses, including a costal town and a busy city.  There are sixty challenges in all.
	.
	When racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races.  Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they'll remember.  They'll try to get back at you in a future race.  Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they'll return the favor to you.  Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.
	.
	Like the Football Camp mode in Madden NFL 2004, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.
	.
	With the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire.  You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.
	.
	There are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins.  If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.
	.
	As in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game.  The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.
	.
	Tune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.

	The unwitting recipient of a destructive prosthesis -- a powerful blaster grafted onto his left arm -- John Cain awakes to find himself being hunted down by a military organization, with no recollection of the events leading to this predicament. Inspired by Contra and other such titles, One is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter in which players find themselves traversing a variety of locales, from futuristic Blade Runner-esque cities to remote mountainous regions, all in search of answers.
	.
	The central gameplay mechanic is the player's Rage meter. Simply put, John Cain is fueled by rage. By destroying objects, killing people, and generally causing all kinds of wanton mayhem, he will increase in power. Cain's rage is represented by an orb-like indicator that undergoes a number of color changes, from the relative calm of green to an infuriated red, and beyond.

game: One Piece Mansion
file: ./One Piece Mansion (USA).chd
description:
	In One Piece Mansion, you control Polpo, a manager in charge of building and maintaining an apartment complex inhabited by a host of wacky residents. Your overall job is to keep tenants happy by keeping their stress levels under control. Each inhabitant raises and/or lowers the stress in rooms around them in a particular pattern. For example, Ai-Chan decreases the stress in all the rooms around her, while Heebee increases the stress in the room directly above him.
	The game largely consists of arranging and moving tenants so their stress causing and reducing abilities balance out. If a resident's stress level gets too high, their apartment explodes. As long as you have a building full of happy residents, you'll receive rent checks at the end of every month. But for each room that explodes, you lose a certain amount of cash.
	You also have to deal with the members of the crime organization Syndicate 5, who take over rooms without paying rent and add extra stress to your paying dwellers. The goal is to increase Syndicate 5 members' stress until they can't stand to live in your complex anymore. And if the criminals wander around, bothering other people, you must drive them back into their rooms personally using your security whistle. Fires pose an additional source of turmoil, and these must be dealt with on a one-on-one basis using the fire extinguisher.
	One Piece Mansion's Story Mode revolves around Polpo's sister being kidnapped by a jealous building owner, and consists of a series of stages with specific goals, such as earning $10,000 or building a complex with 30 rooms. The Endless Mode allows you to build to your heart's content, or at least until you run out of money.

	Twenty years after Pac-Man's first adventure in Pac-Land, Pac-Man returns one day to his house only to find it deserted.  Toc-Man and his ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp the dog!  Pac-Man must venture to Toc-Man's lair on Ghost Island to rescue his friends!
	.
	Hidden through this side-scrolling, 3D adventure game, Pac-Man faces challenging puzzles and games that have appeared in Pac-Man's previous games.  Many things in this game are a tribute to original games and even Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde are back for another chance to get Pac-Man.
	.
	There are several kinds of gameplay modes available.  The newest is Quest mode.  Pac-Man can maneuver up/down and left/right on the screen, but the camera is fixed on the side and scrolls along as Pac-Man searches through all the stages of Ghost Island.  The player must collect Pac-Dots, Fruit, Keys, etc to advance through the level all the while defeating ghosts (by bouncing on them) and solving puzzles.  An adventure game, the story progresses as the levels do with switches to be found and chests to be opened.  There is also a scoring system that encourages the player to collect as much as possible.  Make sure you have a Memory card available before starting out on Pac-Man's lengthy quest!
	.
	The other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode.  Classic mode is a 100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man's original game.  Maze Mode is the gameplay from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment.  All the Pac-Pellets, Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in very pleasing 3D.

description:
	The world's youngest superhero, Pajama Sam, is back in his third adventure, Pajama Sam: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet. Serious trouble is brewing on Mop Top Island as the food groups battle for supremacy. The fats and the sweets are forcing the healthy foods off the island and are quickly increasing their numbers in an attempt to take control. To regain order, an emergency Peace Conference has been called to work out a compromise between all the food groups. Compounding the problem is the disappearance of four of the six delegates.
	It's up to Pajama Sam to find the missing delegates and save the day. Along the way, Pajama Sam interacts with many comical characters such as General Beetfoot, the commander in chief of the healthy food groups, Florette, the intelligent broccoli, Granny Smythe, the elderly green apple with so many stories, Sprinkle, a gentle doughnut, Bean Number 47, the distinguished kidney bean, and Zak Zuke, a zucchini with a knack for guessing weight.

	In this sequel to  Pandemonium, the player once again controls the young aspiring sorceress Nikki and the court jester Fargus with his puppet buddy Sid. It is the year of Cheese, and the advent of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities is foretold by the great prophet Nosewasinit.

The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first...
	.
	The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus. There are also level-specific items and vehicles the heroes will encounter on their way.

While there is no overall campaign, there are two different modes to select.

Missions range from straightforward combat with enemy armored lines to more specific tasks, such as defending or destroying a bridge (depending on what side you're currently fighting for). The areas in which tanks do battle are quite large, and there are armored lines as well as infantry fighters to battle against during the course of the game.

game: PaRappa the Rapper
file: ./PaRappa the Rapper (USA).chd
description:
	The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!
	.
	PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.
	.
	Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!
	.
	The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.

game: Parasite Eve
file: ./Parasite Eve (USA).m3u
description:
	An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.
	.
	There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.
	.
	The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.

Defeating enemies rewards money as well as points used to revive and power-up Aya's suppressed Parasite powers, like healing and igniting foes. Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.
	.
	After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.

file: ./Persona 2 - Eternal Punishment (USA).chd
description:
	The follow-up to 1996's Revelations Series: Persona, Persona 2 is a role-playing game pitting high-school teenagers against demons. While investigating the rumor of a curse at the Seven Sister's High School, magazine editor Mary Amano comes face-to-face with a murderer. A mysterious man by the name of Tatsuya Suou saves her, but from this moment on her life is irrevocably changed.
	As with many RPGs, players can gather a party of characters with distinct personalities and attacks. When a random battle begins, the player must first decide upon specific attacks and character turn-order before the fighting begins. Battles will continue until one side is eliminated, although there is also an option to partake in more traditional turn-based battles. Personas, the characters' powerful alter egos, can be used in battle to perform some of the more devastating attacks in the game. That said, not all encounters in the game need to be solved through fisticuffs.
	By using the game's Contact system, players can negotiate with demons and ask them questions. Each character in the party has a different way of negotiating and using the correct negotiator can mean the difference between a successful or failed negotiation. Success will sometimes result in the player receiving money, information, or Tarot Cards -- powerful items that can be used to summon new Personas.

game: Phix: The Adventure
file: ./Phix - The Adventure (USA).chd
description:
	Billed as an action-adventure game for the whole family, this "E"-rated 3D platformer puts players in control of Phix, who must return a special object to a remote location. How was Phix to know the importance of that magic stone that fell from the sky? Still, he probably shouldn't have eaten it -- now the world of Magnetica is in turmoil and only Phix can set things right.
	Reminiscent of the Dreamcast's Super Magnetic Neo, many of the game's puzzles and challenges are conquered by altering positive and negative magnetic forces. Phix will also face fierce creatures and collect special crystals as he makes his way to the Sanctuary, to return the magic stone to its proper place and Magnetica to its former, peaceful state.
	Features:
	* Instantly switch polarities to solve puzzles and defeat enemies
	* Explore five worlds, each featuring multiple stages and a boss encounter

game: Pitball
file: ./Pitball (USA).chd
description:
	Set in the 23rd century, Pitball is the only sport left in existence. There are no rules in this violent battle -- your objective is simply to score as many goals as possible while destroying the other team.
	Before jumping into the action, you'll select from one of twelve available teams. Consisting of two players per roster, teams include human beings and various alien races, each with their own distinctive forms of attack. While the Arquons utilize a series of oceanic attacks, the stone creatures of the Slorillians use volcanic rock to decimate their opponents.
	In this brutal sport, the idea is to smash up the other team in an attempt to make them drop the ball; the ball is made of pure energy. To help your team become stronger, you can purchase items and free agents. Money is gained from bank loans, team sponsors and by placing bets on games. While on the playing field, your team can obtain special power-up items that increase power, revitalize hit points, shield players from attacks and grant other mysterious effects.
	Pitball includes several gameplay options including Training, Single Game and Season modes. The Training mode is specifically designed for novice players and newcomers. Played on a holographic field, it teaches you the basics of gameplay. Whereas the Single Game is simply an exhibition match, the Season is a furious battle to the championship. There are also multi-player options including competitions for two, three and four players and a cooperative Versus mode. When more than two people are going to play, however, a Multi-Tap is needed.

	Pitfall 3D is a 3D platformer in which players guide Pitfall Harry Jr. (the original Pitfall! hero's son, voiced by B-movie king Bruce Campbell) through a wide variety of settings, ranging from the South American jungle to the ruins of the Moku civilization that lie behind a dimensional rift.
	.
	Some old obstacles and enemies appear, such as tar pits that can open up beneath Harry and swallow him whole, ever-present scorpions, and old favorites like rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle. But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.
	Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old Dad.
	Features
	* Explore the landscapes of an active volcano, a prison colony, and Scourge's lair
	* Swing, jump, and hurdle to avoid enemies and obstacles in each environment
	* Lead Harry through a variety of levels in a different world to save Earth from an evil temptress

game: Planet of the Apes
file: ./Planet of the Apes (USA).chd
description:
	The Planet of the Apes is an action/adventure interpretation of the 1968 film (which is itself an adaptation of the Pierre Boule novel). While the game's setting and opening sequence are based very heavily on the original film, the storyline is new and deals with the poignant social conflicts of the futuristic Earth from its own perspective. The game world is a land ruled by hyper-evolved apes in which human beings live like wild animals, without language or civility.
	Players take the role of Ulysses, the human hero of the game. As in the movie, the hero is an astronaut who is transported to the post-apocalyptic Earth when his ship crash-lands in the wilderness. Unlike Charlton Heston's Taylor in the film version of the story, Ulysses realizes fairly quickly exactly when and where he is. The game's most surprising revelations come from other discoveries that Ulysses makes as he proceeds through the adventure. The depth of the plot becomes more apparent as Ulysses discovers that many consider his presence on the planet to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, in which a human messiah would fall from the sky to save mankind from its collapsed state. For what it's worth, Ulysses does not feel very much like a messiah.
	Gameplay follows conventions established by popular titles like Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid. The action is viewed from a third-person perspective, with the "camera" behind the hero's shoulders and panning occasionally to offer a better view in tight spots. While there is plenty of action and combat, the all-important storyline relies on character exploration and interaction for its progression. The game contains hundreds of lines of scripted dialog and Ulysses can have conversations with most non-player characters.
	One of three "modes" determines how Ulysses will approach a given situation. In "normal mode," the hero walks about at a regular pace. In "athletic mode," he is ready for action, running from place to place and able to jump and dodge quickly. In "stealth mode," Ulysses crouches down and moves as silently as possible, allowing him to explore hidden areas without being noticed by guards and other apes. All three modes of action are required to guide Ulysses safely through this diverse and dangerous Planet of the Apes.
	Features:
	* Based on the movie, players take control of the astronaut Ulysses
	* Infiltrate Ape City and stop General Ursus from exterminating humans
	* Battle bats, hyenas, baboons, rats, and more

game: Point Blank
file: ./Point Blank (USA).chd
description:
	Point Blank is a light gun arcade game, in which players shoots targets in a wide variety of stages. The Playstation version uses the G-Con gun, for action similar to Time Crisis, also by Namco.
	.
	The game has a distinct cartoon theme and is non-violent, making it suitable for all ages. Each stage has a different objective, explained at the start of each stage. This varies from simple target shooting (and avoid to shoot bomb), shooting cardboard villains (avoid shooting cardboard civilians), shooting own color targets (avoid shooting opposing players color), protecting the iconic Dr.Don and Dr. Dan, and many miscellaneous challenges such as the Galaxian stage where lightgun is used in place of spaceships to shoot aliens.
	.
	The stages are presented in groups of 4 and the player or players can choose in which order to play them. You lose a life-heart when you shoot an incorrect target or bomb, or when you fail to complete a mission within the time limit.
	.
	As well as converting the arcade game in its entirety, this conversion also offers a new Quest mode, a Party Play system and more.

game: Point Blank 2

description:
	Point Blank 2 is the sequel to the now classic arcade game Point Blank, which was converted to the PlayStation in 1998. Using the Namco built GunCon (an arcade-like light gun), it offers 70 new shooting galleries, different party modes and a new single-player game.
	If you're playing single-player, you have a few options from which to choose. The arcade mode is simply 16 rounds (of either beginner, advanced or insane difficulty) selected randomly from the 70 different shooting galleries. You'll get to shave sheep by shooting off their wool, test your accuracy in one-shot, one-hit bouts and save Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from wacky situations. There is also an endurance mode in which you climb a tall tower to see how far you can get in three tries.
	Out is the old single-player role-playing game from the original and in is an action-packed adventure. There are four rides to choose from, each with their own theme (like a haunted house and a submarine). The objective is to gain clues to save the King's daughter. To get new players familiar with the game controls, there is also a practice mode.
	If you've got a friend or a group of friends, Point Blank 2 features a wide variety of different play modes. The arcade games are enabled as well as turf wars, tournaments and a team-play option. You can also give certain players handicaps or enable penalties. Up to 8 people can play by alternating Guncons.
	Point Blank 2 ships in two different packaging formats, one with a Guncon and one without.

game: Point Blank 3
file: ./Point Blank 3 (USA).chd
description:
	The escapades of Namco's Dr. Dan and Dr. Don continue in Point Blank 3, the third edition of the irreverent, mini-game based light-gun series. A selection of 80 events are offered, many of which thrust the hapless duo into situations that require timely intervention by the player on their behalf, testing your reflexes and shooting accuracy at the same time. The myriad of events present the player with basic tasks that range in both scope and difficulty. A plethora of mini-game formats are provided that include shooting color-coded targets to protecting the two numbskulls from threatening objects, to those that require the player to perform rudimentary mathematics calculations before shooting the correct answer. Cameo appearances by Tekken characters, classic Namco franchises and other such in-jokes abound in the many scenarios players will find themselves embroiled.
	Arcade, Training and Endurance modes cater mostly to single play, while the Versus and Party modes support multi-player competition, the latter for up to eight players in a tournament-style elimination event.
	Arcade mode grants one or two players the opportunity to advance through 16 randomly selected stages on the difficulty level of their choosing, while Training lets players practice any of the available levels.
	Endurance sees players attempt to pass as many stages as possible with the scant three lives supplied. After every ten stages a bonus event is provided that gives the player an opportunity to earn extra lives or points. The game supports play with both the standard controller and Namco's GunCon peripheral.

description:
	The Powerpuff Girls is an American animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken and produced by Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers, as well as their "father", the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers.
	The Powerpuff Girls revolves around the adventures of Blossom,bubbles, and buttercup . Each of the girls has a color; Bubbles is blue, Buttercup is green and Blossom is pink. The plot of a typical episode is some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu fare, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls also have to deal with normal issues young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain more or less hidden references to older pop culture.
	Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction is a 3D fighting adventure featuring characters from Craig McCracken's hugely successful Cartoon Network series.
	Help Bubbles dispense a little justice on the wily Mojo Jojo or guide Buttercup to deliver a nice knuckle sandwich to deserving Gangreen Gang members.
	In the story mode, players can pick up objects and throw them at an enemy to decrease their opponents health meter. They can use superpowered attacks by collecting vials of Chemical X. If the player successfully defeats the enemy in two out of three rounds, they move to the next enemy location.
	Players can play the story mode or can battle against a friend in a head-to-head battle.

game: Professional Underground League of Pain
file: ./Professional Underground League of Pain (USA).chd
description:
	A combination of ice hockey, basketball, and bare-knuckle fighting, Professional Underground League of Pain is a futuristic sports game with few rules and loads of violence. The object of the game is to throw a plasma ball into a round goal that is suspended above the middle of a hockey-sized arena. Before you or your computer opponent can make a basket, the ball must be charged.
	Each team's charger is located in their opponents end of the court. Be careful, though: If the ball is charged with your opponent's color and you make a basket, your opponent gets the points. The same rule applies for the opposing team. There are different zones on the court and depending on where a player is standing when he makes a shot, he will score one, two, or three points.
	There are sixteen different teams to choose from, representing the countries of England, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Russia. Each team has four players on the court at once. Most of the action consists of passing, shooting, and stealing the ball, punching and sliding into your opponents, and a whole lot of running.
	Features:
	* Lead one of 16 international teams to victory in a futuristic sport resembling basketball
	* Watch the action from a choice of camera angles, including multiple overhead views
	* Compete in league, tournament, and exhibition play

game: Psychic Detective
file: ./Psychic Detective (USA).m3u
description:
	Psychic Detective is an innovative slant on the interactive movie. You're Eric Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things about the case you couldn't otherwise. He has been employed by a strange woman to discover the mystery behind the death of her father.
	The huge mystery starts with Eric meeting the beautiful young woman named Laina. She introduces you to the other members of her family. Once another character appears on screen, an icon with their face on appears on the border. Click on this icon, and Eric will be able to delve into that person?s mind. This comes in handy for getting to know who is suspicious and who is innocent. As you can guess, the game is packed full of characters, so the mystery will take a heck of a long time to finish.
	Eric is able to receive weird psychic flashbacks, which usually feature either scenes of murder, sex or just suspicious goings on. He can influence the behaviour of other characters (annoy them, seduce them, etc.). As well as people, the smallest of items can give vital clues, even a stubbed out cigarette. It all depends on how carefully you watch the screen border. Special ?Psychic Collectors? must be picked up ? these can magnify Eric?s psychic powers. When one is activated, the screen goes into a swirl of colours, and presents the player with a variety of choice s. As the game progresses, Eric gets to play the Black Diamond game. This is a psychic battle which takes place on a board, but it?s a bit strange.
	The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most people might not want to play through again.
	It?s gonna be a big mystery to solve. Heck, there are three CDs for this thing! Clues to the mystery are everywhere, and by touching certain objects Eric can reveal their history. All this is viewed from a first person perspective as Eric chats to all the other characters
	In the PSX version of the game you can save the game anywhere and at anytime except during the Black Diamond games. There are some scenes that are removed comparing to the Pc and 3do versions of the game.

	Punky Skunk is not your ordinary skunk: he's an extreme-sports loving critter trying to save his friends from a kidnapping wolf named Badler. So begins this adventure of a hip skunk and his 30 levels of platforming action, taking him through the sky, across land, underneath the ground and over water. Multiple paths and bonus levels will offer some variety in this throwback to 2D platform games of the past.

In addition, you'll be able to collect stars and 1-ups for extra lives, green orbs to replenish health, and gear icons outfitting Punky with one of six pieces of equipment: Paraglider, Inline Skates, Skysurfer, Pogo Stick, Jetpack or Diggers. Besides using the gear, Punky can either jump or attack enemies with his "spray." Skunk got you stumped? Not to worry, you can resume progress at the start of each cleared stage if you have a memory card.
	Characters:
	- PUNKY (Kuri in Japanese): The hero of our game a skunk. He's had it with Badler, and he's going to fight back.

game: Puzzle Star Sweep
file: ./Puzzle Star Sweep (USA).chd
description:
	Puzzle Star Sweep is the first puzzle game in A1 Games' line of budget-oriented titles. The object of the game is to clear an area of red, yellow and blue rectangular blocks by rotating and moving them so their stars line up. Each block is the same size and contains either one or two stars. Your well is constantly being filled with blocks that rise from the bottom of the screen, and the blocks that you place yourself can be placed anywhere they will fit.
	The One-Player Mode is an endless mode where you play until the blocks reach the top of the screen. Story Mode is a series of vs. battles. In this mode, clearing multiple blocks and starting chain reactions dumps obstacles on top of your opponent's playfield. But watch out, because the same can be done to you. The gameplay in VS Mode is the same as in the Story Mode, except you compete against another human player. Attack Mode is a collection of six challenges that revolve around completing specific tasks, such as making as many chains as possible or going for a high score.
	One notable feature in Puzzle Star Sweep is the concept of "stardust," which functions as points that go toward unlocking bonus features. Stardust is earned through a variety of means, including defeating opponents in the Story Mode and earning medals in the Attack mode. ?
	Features
	* Includes four modes of play from the start: 1-player, 2-player, Story and Attack
	* Story mode features eight characters to choose from
	* Unlock Special Mode by collecting star fragments

game: Puzznic
file: ./Puzznic (USA).chd
description:
	The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.
	.
	There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)
	.
	The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.

game: Q-bert
file: ./Q-bert (USA).chd
description:
	Hasbro Interactive continues their series of classic Arcade game remakes with Q*bert for the PlayStation. In this disc you'll find the original game, a new Adventure mode and a special Head-To-Head contest. Those of you who misspent your youths in the Arcades will recall that the original Q*bert stars a little round orange guy with bulging eyes, a round snout for a nose, short legs and no arms or torso. Your job is to hop Q*bert around a pyramid of cubes and change the colors of the cubes to a target color. In later rounds, you will need to change the colors of the cubes more than once in order to achieve your goal. Once the entire pyramid has been changed to the target color, you advance to a new pyramid.
	While you are hopping Q*bert up and down the cubes of each pyramid, enemies, most of which are deadly to the touch, will try and stop your progress. Another way to die is to hop off of the pyramid without landing on one of the three discs that are placed above and beside the pyramid. These discs are useful when enemies, such as Coily the snake (Q*bert's archenemy), are in hot pursuit. Green enemies and objects can (and should be) be touched, and some of them cause trouble. For example, Slick and Sam wreak havoc by hopping on cubes and changing their color.

game: Qix Neo
file: ./Qix Neo (USA).chd
description:
	QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito's arcade game from 1989. The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines.
	.
	The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.

game: Rally Cross
file: ./Rally Cross (USA).chd
description:
	A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.
	.
	Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.
	.
	One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.

	Rayman Rush is a on-foot racing game developed and published by Ubisoft, based on the Rayman universe. In many ways, it is like half of a port of Rayman Arena, featuring conversions of the same race tracks, the same introduction movie and also character theme songs (it, however, lacks the battles from M, and the character roster is different). It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2 characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months after Rayman M/Arena.
	Races take place on 12 tracks in four worlds and there are five main modes of play: Training, Championship, Time Attack, Lum, and Target. Some of the modes of play in Rayman Rush concern more combative contests, as opposed to straightforward racing. Success allows players to unlock new characters and play modes. Two Rayman Rush players can race head-to-head, split-screen style.

It featured the same game engine, and even the game menus are the same, although it is a game engine with slightly improved graphics. Four characters from the original game are also in Re-Loaded, such as Mamma, Bounca, Butch, and Cap'n Hands. Vox, however, is not present in the game and is replaced by two new female characters: a pink-haired, cannibalistic sex symbol named The Consumer, and a malfunctioning android nun named Sister Magpie. Via cheat code, Sister Magpie can unlock hidden character Fwank from the previous game for use in Re-Loaded. If unlocked, Fwank is the best character in Re-Loaded, with the most speed and best armour. All of the returning characters have new weapons and/or variations of their costumes. There are twelve blood-soaked new worlds to annihilate, much bigger than the levels encountered in the previous game, and with the added bonus of being able to morph the surrounding terrain with high-powered weaponry and explosives.

game: Re-Volt
file: ./Re-Volt (USA).chd
description:
	For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live!
	.
	Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from.
	.
	There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places.
	.
	In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.

	Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.

game: Resident Evil: Ultimate Director's Cut
file: ./Resident Evil - Ultimate Director's Cut.m3u
description:
	After receiving a distress call from the Bravo Team, an elite group from S.T.A.R.S (Special Tactics And Rescue Squad) flew into the desolate Raccoon City. Apparently, the team had uncovered something concerning the Umbrella corporation -- a biotech research company. But then, without warning, the Bravo Team vanished into thin air.
	Upon landing in the small city, the members of S.T.A.R.S began to investigate. They heard some strange noises coming from the surrounding woods and realized the sounds were getting closer. Scared, they took off running and kept on until they came to a large, ominous mansion. Seeking safety they entered, locking the door behind them. Their adventure had just begun.
	.
	This is a mod of Resident Evil: Director’s Cut – DualShock Ver.
	It inserts the original soundtrack back from “Resident Evil” in “Resident Evil: Director’s Cut”, meaning you get the DualShock features without the DualShock soundtrack.
	The original, uncut, full-color FMVs have been inserted. They’re higher quality than the original black and white ones, too.
	A new Deranged Mode replaces Arrange Mode, which condenses the Spencer Mansion while making it a much more difficult experience.
	A second disc is included that replicates the Sega Saturn exclusive Battle Mode, as well as including a new Maze Mode that turns the mansion into a nonviolent labyrinth. Choose the wrong door and it’s back to the start for you.
	.
	There is one small bug that was never fixed: on Jill’s route, if you get poisoned by the Yawn, a cutscene triggers of her waking up in the infirmary save room. Should this happen, a small room with candles you have to use the Lighter on will instead warp you inside the Garden’s shed without needing to collect any Crests. As the candle room doesn’t have any plot significant items, it can be safely ignored if the Yawn poisons Jill.

game: Resident Evil: Survivor
file: ./Resident Evil - Survivor (USA).chd
description:
	Resident Evil Survivor is a spin-off of Capcom's survival horror series. Instead of giving players control of characters from a third-person perspective as in previous games, Resident Evil Survivor takes place from a first-person viewpoint. Originally conceived as a light-gun game (Capcom opted to take this feature out of the U.S. release, citing heightened tension over gun violence), it essentially plays like one. Players may rotate their view and move up and down hallways, but when the zombies come slouching, it will be time to let loose a hail of bullets to bring them down.
	Although the plot of Resident Evil Survivor is a side-story, it still refers to the events of other Resident Evil games. Raccoon City, the now-famous American suburb gripped by an industrial plague that turned its citizens into zombies, is gone, blown completely off of the map in order to keep the dreaded virus from spreading. Unfortunately, Umbrella, the wicked corporation that created the deadly outbreak, hasn't stopped spreading its own dark research. The company has victimized another small town, and apparently in a desperate attempt to flee the carnage, a helicopter has crashed. In this chopper is a man who cannot remember who he is or what he was doing prior to the crash. He is armed with only a handgun, and ahead of him he has a task that none would envy -- to escape this nightmare town crawling with zombies and other foul creatures, and discover who he is.
	Items, weapons, and enemies have all been borrowed from the main series, as has the jumpy, tense atmosphere, the strange dialogue, and the series' trademark eerie music. The only noticeable thing missing from Survivor are the puzzles found in the other Resident Evil titles. This game is about action, through and through.

In their escape from the city, the two protagonists Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield encounter other survivors and are confronted by William Birkin, the mutated creator of the even more powerful G-virus.
	Previously confined to an old mansion, the Umbrella corporation's legacy of fatal mutations has spilled over into nearby Raccoon City. The once peaceful town is now overrun with zombies and all manner of genetic mutations. New police recruit Leon Kennedy and Claire Redfield; the sister of STARS agent Chris Redfield, find themselves in the middle of an experiment gone horribly wrong.

Zan proceeds through enemies and challenges in each level to eventually reach the boss who he then battles in some form of specialized combat or pattern. Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.

description:
	Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicated's cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.
	.
	On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race.

description:
	Saban's Power Rangers Time Force brings the 2001 incarnation of the long-running Fox Kids show to the PlayStation. Players will take on the role of one of five Power Rangers -- red, green, blue, yellow and pink -- and battle evil throughout the universe and throughout time. Each Ranger has his or her own different attribute levels in categories like power, speed and martial arts skill.
	Each of the game's eight levels takes place in a different time period. Players will have to tame the Wild West, take down evil cavemen in the Stone Age, and go toe to toe with pirates on the high seas. Most levels require players to find objects scattered about the level before they can go on to fight the boss. And once they beat a boss the first time, it will mutate into a giant sized version, as on the show. It is then necessary to dispatch the villain by taking control of the Power Rangers' famous Blue Zord.
	Once a character has entered a level, they have a certain amount of time to complete the stage. If the timer runs out, the level doesn't end but players won't receive a power-bar bonus. To best the clock in any given level, players will come upon small and large hourglass icons. These icons slow down the clock or add a large chunk of time. Players will also find health power-ups and charger stations where they can regain the power to perform special maneuvers they will learn throughout the game. And if you run out of time in a level, you always have the opportunity to give it a try again.

Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime: the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc.
	.
	"Saga Frontier 2" continues the non-linear gameplay traditions of the SaGa series. You can visit all towns at your wish and at any time, recruit anyone to your party, and freely upgrade your party members by gaining new abilities and distributing them among your characters. You can learn magic spells by collecting artefacts, and combining them to produce more powerful types of magic. Similar to Konami's  Suikoden series, there are three types of combat: one-on-one (duel), turn-based party combat, and strategic army battles.

	You are sent to investigate an outbreak of radiation sickness aboard the space station Icarus, but once aboard, you realize your primary objective is the least of your worries. The captain has been murdered, an assassin threatens a visiting senior Senator, and a power struggle arises as the station careens toward the sun. Save yourself, or save the ship?
	Sentient's main feature is the artificial intelligence controlling multiple individual crew members aboard the station, each with their own assignments and behaviors. You interact with the AI characters through an elaborate parser interface, which allows you to ask them everything from the location of a vital piece of equipment, to their opinion of another member of the crew. To succeed, you must take advantage of the crew's help through this social system.
	Through interaction with more than 60 characters and exploration of 200 real-time rendered locations you need to try and save the ship, and yourself. The game automatically randomizes sub-plots so that it will be different every time you play.
	Sentient requires 6 memory blocks for one saved game.

file: ./Sentinel Returns (USA).chd
description:
	Enter a surreal world where you must battle the Sentinel and his sentries over 650 chequered, 3D landscapes.  Energy and movement are completely redefined in this unique blend of arcade and strategy elements. You, only known as an intelligent presence, move about the landscape by teleporting between robot "hulls".  Any object in your field of vision can be absorbed for energy, as long as you also see the square of the landscape that the object is standing on.  By aiming at any square your can see, and spending energy, you can create a new robot hull and teleport your presence to it, or you can create neutral objects: trees to block yourself from the Sentinel's gaze, or boulders that can be stacked.  You gain height in the landscape by creating a robot on top of a stack of boulders, until you can see the Sentinel's square at the highest point in the landscape and absorb him.  The problem is that the Sentinel slowly rotates and ruthlessly absorbs anything in his field of vision that is more potent than a tree, including yourself.  In later levels, his sentries will threaten you with absorption from several directions.

On his journey he meets the beautiful elven girl Windleaf and the robot Harv-5, who help him to reach his ultimate goal.
	.
	Although it all seems like a typical Japanese RPG, it is not. Shadow Madness was developed and produced in the USA, although, beyond any doubt, the Final Fantasy series has been the main source of inspiration here. The battles are random, like in many Japanese RPGs, and the battle system is almost the same like in Final Fantasy games: menu-based, with several sub-menu choices. The graphics are in 3D with polygonal characters in anime/manga style (what some people call "deformed").

game: Shanghai: True Valor
file: ./Shanghai - True Valor (USA).chd
description:
	Shanghai: True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding "free" tiles of the same type.
	.
	For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining.

game: Sheep
file: ./Sheep (USA).chd
description:
	Sheep is a combination strategy and puzzle game, featuring light elements of war or battle simulations, built around a wacky story in which space-faring alien explorers from millennia ago devolve into domesticated sheep on Earth. Now their ancestors are trying to round them up by secretly enlisting the aid of two humans (Bo Peep and Adam Half Pint) and two animals (a sheepdog and a pet) through subliminal mind control.
	Players take the role of the Earthly "herders" to lead the flocks through six worlds with multiple levels, eventually reaching special rendezvous point where they'll be loaded onto UFOs for the trip back to their home world of Ovis Aries. No direct control is exerted on the sheep so players must manipulate objects and obstacles, as well as rely on the strengths of each herder, to accomplish the tasks. Levels have time limits and a minimum number of sheep to be saved from each flock.
	Four breeds of sheep, each with distinctive characteristics, must be herded through all levels. Modern Pastoral are intimidated domesticated sheep, Modern Factorals are fashion-minded sheep too dumb to discern danger from safety, Long Wools are a sub-culture breed that love rock music, and Neo Genetics embrace new technology. Other features include three difficulty settings, bonus games for collecting all special "Golden Sheep" within each world, and two-player action.
	Features
	* "Artificial stupidity" AI reflects levels of sheep dumbness
	* Six worlds with multiple levels; four breeds of sheep
	* Use indirect herding techniques to lead sheep to safety
	* Two-player capability and bonus levels

description:
	SilverLoad is the title of a graphic adventure video game produced by Vic Tokai in 1996. In this single-player game, you control, via a first person perspective, a Wild West cowboy as he ventures into a haunted town in order to save two children that were taken from their parents.
	.
	The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a "M" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release.
	.
	As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various "hot spots" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, you have to restart the game from the beginning, or from wherever you saved the game.

It's No Picnic has you guiding Hefty through 10 levels as you try to rescue all nine Smurfs before confronting Gargamel.
	Watch out for hazardous spikes, pitfalls, and falling rocks while you avoid Gargamel's servants, bees, bats and other creatures. You can also gain secret fighting and jumping skills by defeating special characters. Collect 100 coins, candy canes, or other objects in the level to gain an extra life, and utilize flowers that swallow you whole and mushrooms to gain access to higher areas. Each level in "It's No Picnic" is based upon the six areas of "It's a Piece of Cake," but with a few surprises.
	Just when you thought life was grand in Smurf village, Gargamel appears with another devious plan. Hefty is just one Smurf and needs you to help him return Baby Smurf to Smurf village before Gargamel has time to wreak any more havoc!

In both modes, gamers can choose from one of three different boarder characters as they ride through the game's 27 different courses. Additionally, each of these courses can be tackled by two players at once in a horizontally divided split-screen.

game: Sol Divide
file: ./Sol Divide (USA).chd
description:
	Set against a medieval fantasy backdrop, Sol Divide is a 2D side-scrolling shooter that pits one or two players against a horde of flying enemies. There are three different characters that can be played as, each with their own weapon and fighting style. Various magic scrolls can be found by defeating enemies which allow the player to cast several different types of spells including lightning and fire.
	.
	The story itself concerns an evil being who sets out looking for a Power Stone and cuts down all in his path with his sword, the Sol Divide. It is up to you to stop him, battling your way through several stages in both Arcade and Original Mode (which contain different areas and require different tactics to beat, the Original Mode being designed as a more difficult experience for players who want to progress on to a higher challenge).
	.
	Defeating enemies rewards the player with different items to help them on their journey, including the aforementioned magic scrolls, healing potions, magic bottles (only when playing Arcade Mode) and protection accessories (if playing Original Mode).

game: Sorcerer's Maze
file: ./Sorcerer's Maze (USA).chd
description:
	As in the classic arcade title Breakout, Sorcerer's Maze presents players with a series of increasingly difficult stages, each of which must be cleared by destroying a variety of colored bricks found within. Players are equipped with a small paddle, capable only of horizontal movement, which they maneuver so as to deflect a tiny ball around the screen -- the ball will destroy any brick it contacts, while continuing to ricochet.
	Failing to keep the ball in play will result in the loss of a life -- lose three and the game is over. Destroying certain bricks will result in power-ups being dropped into play, which will alter such variables as the size of the paddle and the number of balls onscreen at any one time, to name but two. Power-ups can also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious situations that may lie ahead.
	The game comprises more than 100 stages in all, with every ten stages grouped into a "world" based upon a specific theme. At the conclusion of each world, players will face off against a boss creature that must be dispatched in order to continue. Sorcerer's Maze supports both two-player cooperative and competitive play, the former allowing two players to assist each other in clearing each stage, and the latter involving a race to see which player can clear the stage first.

game: Soul Blade

description:
	In the 16th century, a sword surfaces that is so powerful, so evil that warriors from all over the globe seek it out. It is Soul Edge, a demon blade. From America to Europe to Japan, these warriors fight each other for the chance to obtain it. Soul Blade is a 3D weapons fighting game that chronicles their story.
	.
	A complete 3D fighting game that allows for side steps, Soul Blade has twelve colorful fighters (ten standard, two hidden, plus additional costumes for a few fighters), each with various weapons and styles. The first ten can be used in all the combat modes, while the hidden two can only be used in versus and arcade mode.
	.
	Namco enhanced the arcade version (called Soul Edge) by adding a well done CGI intro, plus a story mode to the addition of the traditional team, survival, and time attack modes. The story mode goes into greater detail about each character, and is presented in an ancient book format. The story mode also allows you to unlock more of each characters' extra weapons. These weapons, which vary in lengths, stats, and durability, add to the options available players in the versus mode.
	.
	Soul Blade's sequel is SoulCalibur, both in the arcades and for the Sega Dreamcast

description:
	From the start the player chooses to be either a young male ronin named Kotaro or a teenage female ninja named Lin (Rin). From then on he or she travels through prerendered levels, killing enemies and fulfilling their mission.
	.
	The game's combat system is quite detailed, and might take a while to get used to. However, when mastered, it is relatively easy for Lin and Kotaro to dispatch multiple enemies quickly from different directions, while simultaneously avoiding the enemies thrusts and swipes. There is a single attack button, but combined with different directional buttons pressed in different combinations and held down for various intervals. There are different attack speeds which correlate to the weight of the equipped weapon, and this is displayed on the sword's 'check' window (also displayed is the sword's length and sharpness, and a brief description of the blade).

	Through five stages of first-person shooter action (each with three or four sub-levels), prepare to face the likes of malevolent turkeys, snowball-throwing clones, ruthless cows, aliens from another world, killer robots and toys gone bad. In most cases, you'll also have to defeat larger versions of these baddies called "tanks," which not only present the greatest danger to South Park and must be stopped before reaching town, but also generate more small enemies until they are destroyed. The end of each stage features a battle with an extremely powerful boss character.

Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions. Enemy vehicles, tactics, and responses change, based upon your activities, making this the first of STRIKE's new "Living Battlefields".

	Of course, there is a downside to expanding one's territory in the 41st millennium: alien hostility. Various dangers now threaten the livelihood of mankind. Your mission? To eradicate man's greatest foe: the Genestealers, a purple-skinned race with razor-sharp teeth and six limbs. Since they reproduce by finding other races to serve as hosts, they are an aggressive threat that must be stopped at all costs. The plan calls for intercepting their ships known as Space Hulks, before they can infest an unsuspecting planet.

game: Space Invaders

description:
	In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!
	.
	Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.
	.
	You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.

game: Space Jam
file: ./Space Jam (USA).chd
description:
	Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.
	.
	The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.
	.
	Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.
	.
	The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.
	.
	The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.
	.
	There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.
	.
	The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.
	.
	There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.

Covert Assault is no different in this regard, as you'll take on the role of two different elite rangers as they scour the globe, quietly ridding it of evil at every turn.
	.
	In Covert Assault, you choose two rangers from a host of different soldiers with their own abilities. Select from the machine gunner, close-quarters fighter, sniper, grenadier, and rifleman. Once you've chosen your rangers, you will be able to customize them with a whole host of different guns and items such as body armor and grenades. You then enter into the game, which is made up of four different missions, ranging from the island of Sicily to the deep anonymous jungles of a far away place.

	The original Spec Ops for PC was one of the first realistic military tactical combat simulators to be released. After its limited success it spawned many rehashes, pseudo-sequels, and mission packs all bearing the same name. The Playstation's version of the rehash is Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol. Up to two players can simultaneously play through the series of missions the game has to offer. If there's only one player the second ranger is controlled by the CPU. The single player can switch between both rangers at any time, letting the CPU control the other ranger.
	.
	Join one of the most elite military task forces in the world--the U.S. Army Rangers. Play as a U.S. Special Operations Ranger Corps soldier in this third-person shooter. Your main objective: neutralize hostile terrorist threats around the world. With guns blazing or silently under the cover of darkness, navigate your team across harsh terrains of thick jungle, barren desert, arctic tundra, and dense forest. You must use stealth and tactics to your advantage. Oh, a few more squad members and weapons that range from sniper rifles to machines guns wouldn't hurt either. Take out terrorists, rescue hostages and save the free world...that's all this game is asking of you. Will you be able to complete your mission, even though you may be the lone survivor?

game: Speedball 2100
file: ./Speedball 2100 (USA).chd
description:
	Speedball has been described as a cross between handball, roller derby, and hockey (though it's quite a bit more violent than any of those sports -- all in good fun of course). Two teams of nine players each face off in a closed arena with high walls on all sides and a goal at either end. The object is simply to throw the ball through the opponent's goal to score as many points as possible. Points can be scored in other ways as well however, such as lighting all of the stars on a wall or by hitting Bounce Domes with the ball.
	.
	The game is constantly moving as the steel ball is passed back and forth or stolen with a heavy body-slam or a quick elbow to the teeth. Special power-ups can increase scoring possibilities or even temporarily disable opposing players. Several modes of play are available, from quick one-time grudge matches to season-long league play.

game: Spider-Man
file: ./Spider-Man (USA).chd
description:
	Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.
	.
	Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.
	.
	This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.
	.
	Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.
	.
	Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.
	.
	Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.
	.
	There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.

Players take the role of their friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to foil Electro's plan before it's too late. Movement and camera angles are similar to those of the first Spider-Man game, though Spidey has a few new web-slinging abilities in this title and is challenged by some sophisticated puzzle-solving and complex action sequences. Once again, Marvel Comics' legendary Stan Lee provides narration for this adventure.

description:
	Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his "Dark Troopers" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.
	.
	Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal "Jedi" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.

game: Starfighter Sanvein
file: ./Starfighter Sanvein (USA).chd
description:
	Sanvein is a fast-paced top down shooter where time is of the essence and every moment counts. The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia.
	The game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each "floor" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use.
	All the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.
	The game has a unique glitch-futuristic art style and five floors to play through. There are three ships and three weaponry systems to choose from.

description:
	In Starwinder: The Ultimate Space Race, you assume the role of Conner Rhodes, the first representative of Earth sent to compete in a galaxy-wide race. This isn't an ordinary race, however -- an unknown alien race built magnificent rails/tracks throughout the confines of space. Spanning thousands of miles in length, rails act in such a way that when pilots navigate toward one, it increases the speed of the ship.
	.
	As Conner, your overall objective is to bring home the ultimate reward -- the globe-like Starsphere. While your mission sounds fairly basic, it won't be easy; there are seven other pilots vying for the same prize. Residing in the far reaches of the Milky Way, competition includes a half man/half machine humanoid named Ko-Axe, the vengeful Tianna Stone, and an overconfident egomaniac that goes by the name of Dextor -- The Terrible. There are also drone pilots that fill in the rest of the playing field.
	.
	Broken into quadrants, there are 44 different rails/tracks in which to race on; there are ten races per quadrant. While the bulk of the game is played against computer-controlled opposition, there are times when you'll race against the clock in a true test of speed and accuracy. Prove yourself worthy and you'll race against an elite group of pilots through Epsilon Indi -- the final railway. If you manage to win this final race, the Starsphere is as good as yours!

description:
	It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.
	.
	The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.
	.
	The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.

Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.
	.
	The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)

file: ./Street Racquetball (USA).chd
description:
	Squash is a racquet sport played by two players in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. Squash is recognized by the IOC and remains in contention for incorporation in a future Olympic program.
	The game was formerly called squash racquets, a reference to the "squashable" soft ball used in the game (compared with the fatter ball used in its parent game racquets.
	Street Racquetball is one of very few console games featuring the enclosed sport of racquetball, though the first title devoted to the sport, Racquetball, was released in 1981 for the Atari Video Computer System. A1 Games' history of released sports related games includes tennis, boxing, bowling, kickboxing, snowboarding, racing and more.
	As in indoor racquetball courts, Street Racquetball's "outdoor" courts contain two sidewalls, a front wall, serving zones, and a receiving line -- but no ceiling. Players can opt for exhibition mode (against the computer), challenge mode (unlock new characters and courts by winning three consecutive matches), training mode (continuous rally solo play), or two-player VS mode. Three difficulty settings offer "easy," "normal." or "hard" gameplay, ball bounce levels can be adjusted to "low," "middle," or "high," and the eight computer-controlled opponents are rated in performance level, type of game, power, speed, and skill. Shots include slams, lobs, and drop shots.
	Features
	Unlock up to eight computer-controlled players with individual strengths and weaknesses
	Four gameplay modes include exhibition, challenge, training or two-player VS

game: Street Sk8er
file: ./Street Sk8er (USA).chd
description:
	Take to the streets on one of ten stylin' boards in the first skateboarding game for the PlayStation, courtesy of Electronic Arts and Micro Cabin. Two variations of play include the Street Tour Mode, where you skate through three 3D courses trying to pull off as many tricks as you can within a time limit, and Free Skate Mode, where you either play for points or practice your moves without worrying about the clock.
	Skaters can also play against a friend in Versus Mode to see who can pull off the most tricks. Street Sk8ter features 200 different moves and combinations to perform while racing, each of which earns your skater points depending on its level of difficulty. Of course, if you wipe out, you'll have points deducted from your score. Three other "traditional" areas are available, including a Half-Pipe, Big Air and Bowl.
	The main aspect of the game is the Street Tour, which is structured similar to a racing game: weave your way down sidewalks and streets, pass through checkpoints to extend your time, and finish before the clock winds down to zero. Along the way there will be plenty of opportunities to catch some air and perform tricks with the pad. The goal is to score as many points as possible with one of four alter-egos: TJ, Jerry, Ginger and Frankie.
	Each skater also differs in style (Goofy or Regular) and has individual ratings in jump power, cornering, maximum speed and acceleration. Playing through the Street Tour with different characters allows you to open up additional routes, unlock bonus skaters and reveal new decks (designs on the main platform area of a board). You'll even get to increase your character's overall ratings!
	After finishing each course, players will also be able to watch their performance on instant replay. Other notable features include: Dual Shock Controller support (vibration only), best times saved to memory card, an announcer, deck graphics from Powell Skateboards, and twelve alternative music tracks from bands under the Epitaph and Capitol Records labels.

description:
	A terrorist organization by the name of Hex is threatening the peace and prosperity of the world. If their demands are not met or they are not stopped, their Shockwave devices are armed and ready to go. Once detonated, they will reduce the world to utter chaos -- massive floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions will be the result.
	So, who's going to stop them? You are, as the leader of the StrikePoint Team. By taking to the skies and launching an all-out air assault on Hex, your only mission is to destroy their existence and world-destroying plans. You've got a lot of weight riding on your shoulders, better not let the world down.
	In StrikePoint, you will pilot one of three different helicopters, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Where one sacrifices maneuverability for the sake of shields and firepower, the other is stealthy and fast without a lot of weaponry. The other is a middle-of-the-road chopper that is balanced in every category.
	Played from various 3D perspectives (first-person, third-person), there is a multitude of missions to complete. For the most part, your objective will be to destroy any and all enemy resistance. Sometimes, your target will be a specific building or a search and rescue mission (captured allied intelligence). Your mission will not be easy as you are met with considerable resistance. Enemies come from both air and ground and you will have to deal with them accordingly.
	StrikePoint also comes equipped with a two-player feature where you and a friend can play a cooperative game against the computer or duke it out with each other in a combat mode.

The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran.

Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights.
	.
	The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.

	Sequel to the early PlayStation RPG. As a member of the Alliance, a military force only really hinted at in the original, you play the unwitting hero of the game: an orphan who has been raised by a quiet, unassuming battle hero in a seemingly ancient war. Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Jowy, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages. As the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. The battle system is turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the option to run the battle in Auto mode.

game: Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo

description:
	A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.
	.
	Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.

game: Swagman
file: ./Swagman (USA).chd
description:
	That Swagman sure has a lot of nerve! He's another evil, demented fellow who's planning to take over the world for his own personal gain. And this guy means business. You see, he's basically a boogie-man who has the power to entrap people in their own nightmares forever. Fortunately, there are two brave souls out there ready to fight Swagman face to face. Their names are Zac and Hannah, two 8 year old twins.
	Swagman is a combination of the platform and adventure genre. While in the "Real World", the game is adventure-like; find and collect items and/or keys to open certain doors. When you enter the dream sequences, called the Territories, the game becomes a platform game. The combination of genres and the whole real world/dream world is a neat idea and throw in some nice, cartoonish and highly colorful graphics and you've got a nifty little game.
	Features:
	- Help twins Zack and Hannah escape a nightmarish world
	- Explore six levels to defeat the evil Swagman
	- Use Warp Circles to change positions

description:
	A great swordsman named Stahn Aileron takes a ride on a giant dragon ship. During the flight, the ship is attacked by pirates. Looking for a weapon to defend himself, Stahn discovers a sword. Very soon he finds out it is not just an ordinary sword, but the legendary talking sword Dymlos, who has been sleeping for many years and who can be awakened only if the world is in grave danger. But what exactly is the danger that awakened Dymlos now? With the help of a few friends, Stahn decides to explore the world and to find out what is wrong.
	"Tales of Destiny" is a follower of the SNES RPG Tales of Phantasia. The combat in this game is action-based. You control the main hero in real time and make him perform various attacks. Other party members are controlled by the game's AI, but you can pause the battle at any time and assign new combat style to any one of them.
	PLOT:
	In the past, a comet crashed into the world, throwing dust clouds into the sky and shrouding the world in cold and darkness. At about the same time, the inhabitants, the Aethers, discovered a new form of energy from the meteorite's core, which they named Lens. Combining this with further research, the people were able to create cities in the sky and live in them. Unfortunately, only a select few were chosen, leaving the rest of the people to remain on the bleak surface of the planet. These people became known as the Erthers.
	Over time, the sky's inhabitants became known as the Aetherians and their Aeropolis cities. They created a horrific weapon called the Belcrant that shot down any who dared oppose them. This caused full scale war to erupt between the two civilizations, now known as the Aeth'er Wars. However, regardless of their will and persistence, the Aetherians continued to have the power to dominate every engagement through the use of their superweapon.
	In their disgust of their civilization's elitist behavior, a group of Aetherian scientists went to the surface. There, with aid from the people, they were able to create special swords, called Swordians, that were sentient. Unlike other weapons, these swords chose their masters and were able to call upon the elements of nature to do their will. Using these weapons, the people of the surface finally had an edge against the Aetherians.
	Thanks in part to the Swordians and their masters, scores of Aeropolis were sunk to the depths of the ocean. In the end, the Erthers claimed victory over the Aetherians. Thousands of years later, this story has been mostly forgotten. In the meantime, the purposeless Swordians fell into a deep stasis sleep, only to awaken when grave threats rose once again.
	The story of the game begins when country-boy-turned-adventurer Stahn Aileron, who seeks fame and adventure, sneaks aboard the flying ship Draconis as a stowaway. He is found out by the crew and forced to work as a deckhand, but when a large hostile force attacks the ship, the crew is overwhelmed and Stahn breaks free during the ensuing chaos. Looking for a usable weapon to fend off the attackers, he gains access to a storeroom and discovers a "junk" sword. However, the sword starts talking to him, calling itself Dymlos and claiming to be a sentient Swordian from the Aeth'er Wars. Armed with Dymlos, Stahn fights his way to an escape pod, which he uses to escape the rapidly descending ship before it crashes into the ground.
	Dymlos becomes the key to the fame, fortune, and adventure Stahn seeks as the young man meets other Swordians, quickly becoming embroiled in a battle for a relic of the Aeth'er Wars: a huge, extremely powerful Lens called the Eye of Atamoni.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Tales of Destiny continues the trademark Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS) of the Tales series, with the E-LMBS (Enhanced Linear Motion Battle System), there are some graphical enhancements to the system as it was first implemented in Tales of Phantasia. Nevertheless, the combat is still very similar to the first game in the series, taking place on a 2-D plane where characters and enemies act in real time. Typical RPG conventions of HP, TP, experience, and leveling apply. Melee and ranged attacks are executed in real time, with spell casting requiring a chanting time that increases directly with the complexity of the spell being cast. When the chanting of a spell is complete, game-time temporarily stops as the spell animation is carried out and damage is assigned, so spells essentially act as interrupts. Special melee and ranged attacks do more damage or have more hits than normal attacks, but require technical points, or TP, to be consumed for use. Also, the battle system rewards the player with extra experience for stringing together multi-hit combos. The end result of this break from traditional turn-based RPG battle systems is a more fast-paced and reaction oriented system that behaves more like a fighting game and less like a typical Final Fantasy-esque title.

game: Tales of Phantasia
file: ./Tales of Phantasia PS1 pre-v1.1 fix 1.chd
description:
	Tales of Phantasia is a Super Nintendo game in the role-playing video game genre published by Namco and released in Japan in 1995, selling 212,000 copies. It is the first mothership title in the Tales RPG series and was later remade/re-released on the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance and PlayStation Portable.   This game was originally developed by Wolf Team. It was written and programmed by Yoshiharu Gotanda, designed by Masaki Norimoto and scored by Motoi Sakuraba and Shinji Tamura. The character designs were created by manga artist Kosuke Fujishima. An anime series based on the game has also been created.   STORY:   Tales of Phantasia begins by showing a heroic battle between four unknown warriors against an evil sorcerer and king, Dhaos, the outcome of which changed the fate of the world. The warriors were victorious, but Dhaos escaped through time. However, four different heroes are awaiting him: they seal the weakened Dhaos away using the power of two pendants, thus returning peace to the world.   Twelve years after Dhaos had been sealed away, a young swordsman named Cress Albane (Also romanized 'Cless Alvein') and his best friend, Chester Burklight, live in the town of Toltus. One day, while Cress and Chester are out hunting in the forest, the town is destroyed by a dark knight named Mars and his soldiers. Every villager is killed in the attack, including Chester?s sister and both of Cress?s parents. While Chester mourns, Cress vows for revenge. He decides he should flee to the town of Euclid, where his uncle lives; however, Chester refuses because he wants to stay behind and bury the dead first, and Cress finally decides to go by himself.   Upon his arrival in Euclid, Cress heads to the northwestern house, where his uncle lives. However, on Cress's first night there, his uncle betrays him, and he is thrown in jail by Mars. The heirloom pendant entrusted to Cress by his father, Miguel, is taken away from him, but Cress does not know of its significance in holding Dhaos sealed, nor that his father was one of the four who sealed him away.   In prison, Cress hears a voice, and the person it belongs to gives him a pair of earrings, which he uses to break down the wall of his cell. As he goes to thank the person, however, Cress sees that the individual has been impaled by a sword; he takes the blade and uses it to open the prison doors. In one of the cells, he meets a woman named Mint Adnade. She thanks Cress for freeing her and asks him to also free the person in the cell across from hers, who she says is her mother. At this point, Cress realizes that Mint's mother was the person who had helped him to escape his own cell. Not wanting Mint to learn of her death, he says that he saw no one in that cell and insists that they must escape immediately, which they achieve by traveling through the prison's aqueducts.   GAMEPLAY:   "Tales of Phantasia" presents a unique combat system: The battles have a lot in common with fighting games: you fight on a platform that slowly scrolls forward and have to attack your enemy in real time. Other party members are controlled by AI. You can pause the game at any time and use magic, items, or choose an overall strategy for your allies.   The playstation version is more a remix than a remake, since it features different character techniques, character voices, fmv sequences, new quests and enhanced graphics and music.

The game was created as a spiritual sequel to Fire Emblem by the game's creator, Shouzou Kaga, who no longer had the rights to the Fire Emblem intellectual property upon leaving Intelligent Systems and Nintendo. The game shares the same interface, graphical and music style, and overall gameflow.The game involves the player moving characters in a turn based fashion across a large grid from a top-down perspective. The player is tasked with certain objectives, commonly fighting and defeating an entire opposing faction, or a particular member or leader of a faction.    There are two protagonists in the game, Runan and Holmes, each with their own army to command. Though the two armies travel separately for the majority of the game, they cross paths at several points of the story, allowing the player to switch allocations of fighters and items amongst the two groups. Runan's story follows a strict set of scenarios where he battles against an enemy empire, while Holme's scenario allows for more freedom, allowing the player to ignore the main scenarios in favor of gathering treasure and increase the army's strength.

description:
	Technomage is a video game released by German game developer Sunflowers. Technomage was only released in PAL territories.   The player character, Melvin, must save the world of Gothos from destruction. The people of Gothos are split into two types, the magic using Dreamers, and the technological Steamers. Melvin is half Dreamer, half Steamer. Melvin starts in his hometown of Dreamertown, when it is attacked by monsters. He is blamed, and taken to trial to be exiled. His uncle then teaches you the "basics", pending your exile. This section serves as the tutorial stage. After this you leave Dreamertown and head to Steamertown, on your adventure to find your father.   TechnoMage: Return of Eternity is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure, role-playing, and action-based combat. Many of the game's missions involve peaceful wandering through the environments, talking to characters, and performing tasks that often involve solving puzzles of various kinds, in an adventure-like fashion. RPG elements are present in experience points which the hero receives form eliminating enemies and completing quests.   STORY:   After passing Steamertown, Melvin enters a huge underground labyrinth called "The Hive", where his father vanished during an expedition. The Hive is a vast network built by the former rulers of Gothos. It contains grave complexes, libraries and laboratories; Melvin finds the first crystal of eternity there. When he leaves the Hive, he steps into the Great Forest, the realm of the fairies. They suffer from goblin uproars which are stopped by Melvin who then joins a pair of Shach traders on their journey to the canyon. Here, Melvin encounters Dagomar for the first time, the last survivor of the former rulers of Gothos. He acts as Melvin's mentor and guide. Also, Melvin befriends Talis, a girl who lives in exile because she also is half Dreamer, half Steamer.   After clearing the canyon's mines, they travel to the tower, the former rulers' fortress of knowledge, which is now haunted by an undead dragon. As Melvin kills the dragon, another dragon is freed who takes Melvin to the volcano, which is where the Shach traders live. In the deeper levels of the volcano's caves, Melvin discovers more artifacts and buildings from the former rulers, as well as a map which leads him, talis and the dragon to the ancient ruins of the former capital of Gothos. Here, Dagomar drops his disguise and Melvin has to find out that he is Ramogad, the traitor who led to the downfall of the former rulers. After a big fight against Ramogad, Melvin uses the crystals of eternity found in the different regions of Gothos to reactivate both a stasis trap to stop Ramogad and a barrier device which uses a magic liquid to shield Gothos from the demon realms below. Talis then helps Melvin to escape the collapsing ruins and they fly across the ocean towards the sun.

description:
	If you're looking for a game that the whole family can enjoy, then look no further than TECMO STACKERS. Against the computer or a friend, you'll go head-to-head in some fast-paced puzzle games that will bow you away. The object is to fill your opponent's side of the board while keeping your own side clear of any blocks.
	If you connect four quads (blocks) of the same color, you'll create a chain reaction that will really give you an advantage. If you find yourself in a pinch, utilize a bomb to temporarily clear your board. There are four gameplay modes to choose from Arcade Competition, Time Trials, Chain Reaction, and Insane and more than 20 levels to master, making TEMCO STACKERS one of the most complete action or puzzle games available.

game: Tecmo Super Bowl
file: ./Tecmo Super Bowl (USA).chd
description:
	The original Tecmo Bowl was an instant hit on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game combined simple, easy to grasp arcade action, insanely catchy music and real NFL players. Tecmo's sequel in 1991, Tecmo Super Bowl, added the NFL license and detailed statistical tracking for an entire season. It was considered by many as the best football game released for the 8-bit system. The series would continue into the 16-bit market, with three games released on both the SNES and Genesis (Tecmo Super Bowl, Tecmo Super Bowl II and Tecmo Super Bowl III). While it would face heavy competition from the Maddens and Montanas, the game still maintained a strong loyal following--a testament to its universal appeal.
	Tecmo Super Bowl marks its first appearance on the Playstation after success in the both the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets. While the name hasn't changed, the game has undergone several refinements--perhaps none more dramatic than the ability to change the field's perspective. Instead of a horizontal view, you can now adjust the camera to a vertical or diagonal position. Instant replay, a tournament mode, expanded playbooks and live commentary have also been added to the game, to bring it up to speed with similar PlayStation sports offerings.
	The hallmarks of the Tecmo series have been left unchanged: you still get both the NFL and NFLPA licenses, variable weather conditions, stat tracking, injuries, multiple schedules and an emphasis on arcade action. Don't like how your team is performing? Feel free to edit players' names, abilities or trade them away! Just make sure you save enough room on your memory card--a hefty eleven blocks is needed to save your data.

The prize is typically control of the company, which then allows the winner to host the following tournament.
	The arcade versions of the game have traditionally used PlayStation based hardware to run the games, and subsequently each Tekken installment was eventually made for its respective PlayStation.

game: Tenchu: Stealth Assassins
file: ./Tenchu - Stealth Assassins (USA).chd
description:
	After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life while his back is turned.
	Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame, with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions. You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields of elusiveness and effectiveness.
	Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you). Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja.
	A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords. For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.

game: Terry Pratchett's Discworld
file: ./Terry Pratchett's Discworld (USA).chd
description:
	This game is based on the Discworld novel series created by Terry Pratchett. You play Rincewind, a wizard with of little courage or talent in the occult.
	A dragon is ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the city Rincewind the wizard lives in. The Arch Chancellor sends him to slaigh the beast and you must help him! So you wake up and take your luggage with you (which thinks it's a dog) and search for anything you can use to kill that dragon.
	Talk to the people of the Discworld (a flat world on which Ankh Morpork lies), though most are useless because they're all mad. And that's exactly the funny part of the game, conversations which lead to nowhere and objects you find on your quest must often be used on such strange things that it's not even logical anymore. This game is meant for gamers who love English humour and like playing an adventure.
	Gameplay:
	The game is one of the most illogical graphic adventures released on PSX: Most of the puzzles have no logic at all and can even be really frustrating.

game: Test Drive: Le Mans

description:
	The 24 Heures Du Mans is the Super Bowl of the racing world. The event, created in 1923, exudes an immense measure of status. In it, the best in the world compete in a brutal, day long race. The goal is to complete the most laps around the famous Le Mans track in a 24-hr. period.
	In Le Mans, the player is offered a choice of three different car classes. On the one hand, we have the GT2 class. It is the easiest of the group, offering a good level of handing. The second type is the GT1. The GT1 cars are designed with professional racing in mind. Although difficult to control, these cars are the most powerful of the classes. Only an experienced driver can handle the GT1 class. Finally, we have the Prototype class of car. These vehicles lie slightly below the GT1 in terms of performance.
	Le Mans offers a number of play modes. The Arcade mode is designed for a quick thrill. It can satisfy the action junkies need for an adrenaline high. In it, the cars are completely indestructible, putting the emphasis on the racing. As the name implies, the Challenge races offer a bunch of difficult obstacles to overcome. Beating the opponent cars will open up a new series of Challenge tracks. The Time Attack mode pits the racer against the clock. Victory in the Time Attack mode will unleash a new fleet of cars.
	The Championship mode is a little bit deeper. In it, the player will participate in an entire racing season, culminating in the famous 24 Heures Du Mans. The Championship mode starts with the GT2 class of car. Upon beating the first series of races, the player will be able to move on to the other car types. Finally, Le Mans offers the Le Mans 24 hr mode. In game time, the Le Mans race lasts the entire 24-hr. period. The player can choose to shorten the outcome by resetting the game time. Be careful, though, as the car can take a lot of damage in a long race.
	Le Mans offers a split screen multi-player mode. In addition, it supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller and the Memory Card.
	Features:
	* 3 play modes: arcade, simulation, and endurance
	* Authentic Le Mans circuit tracks
	* 24 officially licensed racing teams
	* Day and night driving conditions
	* Dual Shock Controller support

game: Tetris Plus
file: ./Tetris Plus (USA).chd
description:
	Tetris Plus is a puzzle video game developed by Natsume and published by Jaleco for arcades exclusively in Japan in 1996, and was ported to the Game Boy, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation later that year. The game would be followed by a sequel, Tetris Plus 2, in 1997.
	GAMEPLAY:
	The game consists of two main modes, Classic Mode and Puzzle Mode. Classic Mode functions like the original Tetris game for the Game Boy except with different music and visuals. However, because the cartridge has battery-powered SRAM, it also has the ability to remember your high-scores, unlike the original Game Boy game. Puzzle Mode is a twist on the classic gameplay that provides a new scenario. Also included is an editor for making Puzzle levels, and Link capability for going head-to-head with another player in either game mode. The Console Versions also have a two player Versus Mode which is essentially puzzle mode with two players racing for the finish line.
	PUZZLE MODE:
	The biggest addition to Tetris Plus is the Puzzle Mode. The player starts by choosing any of four world locations: Maya, Knossos, Egypt, or Angkor Wat. The final area, Atlantis, is unlocked by successfully completing the other four stages (in any order). Each of the four locations has a different level set. Once the game starts, the player is presented with a cluster of pre-placed bricks, and the professor enters the play-area through a disappearing gate. The objective is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and crushes him.
	The player's goal is to guide this archaeologist to the bottom as fast as possible. Two blocks wide and tall, he will aimlessly walk forward until he bumps into a block, after which he turns around and walks the other way. If he comes across a gap that is large enough for him to fit through, he will fall down onto the blocks below him. Conversely, if blocks are placed on top of him, he will climb up them until he reaches the top. As one could guess, if these blocks lead too closely to the spikes, the professor will die.
	Upon starting the level, the spiked ceiling will start at the top of the play-area. About once every eighteen seconds, it will move down one row, slowly taking away workable space. The player is able to make the ceiling go back up, however, if they can clear three or four rows at once. The ceiling will also destroy any placed blocks that are in its way. This can be used as a garbage disposal, by having it remove any unwanted pieces until the piece the player wants shows up.

game: Theme Park
file: ./Theme Park (USA).chd
description:
	Theme Park is a construction and management simulation game designed by Bullfrog Productions and originally released in 1994, in which the player designs and operates an amusement park.
	Like most of Bullfrog's games, Theme Park is permeated by an eccentric sense of humor. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, while Chris Sawyer's Roller Coaster Tycoon series has evolved the concept to offer a far more realistic selection of rides.
	Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.
	Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
	You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.
	It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Starting with a free plot of land in the United Kingdom and few hundred thousand dollars, the player must build a profitable amusement park, making money by opening rides and selling merchandise and refreshments. The goal is to increase the park's value and available cash so that the park can be sold and a new lot can be bought from another part of the world and start building a new theme park.[3] Newer products can be bought after researching them. Once enough money has been made the player can move on to newer plots. Plots are located all over the world and have many different factors that affect gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value.
	There are over thirty attractions available in the game. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides. There are simple rides like the bouncy castle and tree house, and more complicated and expensive rides like the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel.
	There is a focus in the staff side of the park as well. People employed in the park include entertainers, security guards, mechanics, and handymen. Lack of staff can cause problems, including messy footpaths, rides breaking down (and with sufficient neglect, exploding), crime, and unhappy visitors. Occasionally, wages and the price of goods must be negotiated; failure to negotiate results in staff strikes and loss of shipment. Theme Park offers three levels of simulation, with the higher difficulties requiring more management of aspects such as logistics.

game: Thousand Arms
file: ./Thousand Arms (USA).m3u
description:
	In the quiet country of Tradguld, there are many sleepy little towns. Langoud rests on the coast, Sharan is the floating city where most of the trade and business is done, and Myscatonia is clouded in mystery and wonder. Each city has nothing in common with the other except for the fact they share the same country. That is until the Dianova sets their sights on them. Dianova is a dark evil empire bent on conquering the world through swords and magic.
	PLOT:
	Meis Triumph lives in the nature-rich town of Kant deep within the countryside of Tradguld. He has no worries and lives with his loving family who happens to be powerful Spirit Blacksmiths. Then the Dianova brought their war-machine crashing down on his quiet life. Everyone was forced to flee in terror and Meis became separated from the family he loved. He fled to Boyzby where he vows to free his people from the terror and oppression of the Dianovan Empire and where he meets the beautiful Sodina. Now the adventure truly begins.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Thousand Arms by Atlus is an RPG with a faceted story and intricate gameplay. As in all RPGs, it has a turn-based combat system but only the character in the fist position may attack. The other two members of your party are used for defensive back-up.
	You play as Meis Triumph, heir to the Triumphs, a family of Spirit Blacksmiths. You can add two other members to the war party. You must travel the world and talk to people in the cities and towns to get valuable allies and information that will aid you on your quest. Stop in the village shops to get new armor, weapons and other items to truly make your band of heroes unstoppable.
	You also have to go on dates as all great heroes do. Rather than seeking love, these dates have another purpose. Keep your date happy and you can get special weapons, information and new abilities. So be sure to be a gentleman and always pay attention to what must be done in the mini-games to win her over!
	As a Spirit Blacksmith you have the ability to make weapons better by increasing their attack and defensive power as well as adding new features and spells. Of course, along the way you must battle enemies, explore dungeons and perform mini-quests in order to achieve your ultimate goal: the destruction of the Dianovan Empire and the evil Mecha.
	Are you hero enough to save your people? Are you suave enough to be a great date? Do you have the emotional and spiritual power to be a truly powerful Spirit Blacksmith? Pray you do; your entire race is depending on you.
	CHARACTERS:
	- Meis Triumph- (16-years-old) The heir to a family of Spirit Blacksmiths, Meis learned to be a womanizer from his father. Stubborn and lazy, Meis is forced to change his ways against his will, first when the Dark Acolytes force him to leave his comfortable home, and then when the spirits of the Ancient Blacksmiths give him the mission of finding the sacred flames. He is attracted to Sodina, but can't resist hitting on other beautiful women.
	In addition to his ability to reforge weapons to increase their power and grant them magical spells or special attacks, Meis can obtain "Elemental Beasts" to use in combat, similar to the "summons" seen in the Final Fantasy games. His weapon is a sword.
	- Sodina Dawnfried- (15-years-old) The younger sister of a great Spirit Blacksmith named Jyabil, Sodina is a beautiful, red-haired girl; however, she's also very brave. After her brother is killed by the Dark Acolytes, she decides to help Meis on his quest. She has feelings for Meis but finds herself often enraged by his lecherous behaviour. Her weapon of choice is a dagger.
	- Muza Grifford- (21-years-old) A knight and an old friend of Meis, he's brave but not too clever, and tended to freeze when in the presence of pretty girls. He has a very large physique. He develops feelings for Wyna. His weapon is a claymore, a huge sword that normal people would have a difficult time wielding.
	- Wyna Grapple- (17-years-old) The daughter of the King of the Pirates, Wyna is a boisterous girl who loves fighting; she joins the party just to go on adventures. She wears a bikini as well as an eyepatch, but just for effect, she's not missing any eyes. If you pay attention during dates, you'll see that Wyna's eyepatch changes eyes from time to time. At first she's attracted to Meis because of his strength, but later returns Muza's feelings. Wyna's weapon is a large battle hammer.
	- Nelsha Stylus- (Appears to be 16-years-old) A unique girl whose personality changes when she puts on new outfits, due to the spirits that inhabit them. Nelsha is a shy, nerdy-looking girl who speaks of herself in the third person. She dreams of becoming a "Dress Master", a title given to the best clothes designers in the world (similar to Metalia's title of Jewel Master). Her weapon is a magic sewing needle.
	In addition, Nelsha can change her costumes in combat, which changes her form completely and gives her different powers.
	- Kyleen Nelphe- (16-years-old) A green-haired female thief who tries to use the party for her own purposes, but ends up befriending and joining them. Her personality is cynical and sarcastic. She seems attracted to Soushi. Her weapon is a rapier, a sword used for fencing.
	- Soushi Maharoba- (18-years-old) A samurai with a lot of pride, who considers himself a ladykiller as well. His most notable feature is his pink kimono (a garment not usually worn by males). He and Meis can't stand each other at first but eventually come to respect each other. His weapon is a katana called Masamune (a popular name given to katanas in RPGs, named after the blacksmith from feudal Japan).

	Monster Trucks offers nine rugged off-roaders with which to race across jagged, imposing terrains. Not the only game to twist the racing genre to this end, but as you'd expect from Psygnosis, the quality of presentation is head and shoulders above the rest.
	.
	There are two types of courses; circuits offer demanding hilly terrains which can easily trash the vehicle and must be learned intimately. Endurance courses offer greater freedom, with the aim of finding the best route to link eight dispersed checkpoints.
	.
	To avoid any disorientation, arrows guide you to the next marker. Each area, be it snowy or volcanic, has characteristic features and hazards, yet this doesn't stop a repetitive feel developing. The third option is a fun mode, and one you might expect from the developer of Destruction Derby. Players have sixty seconds to take their truck on a car smashing spree.

game: ThunderStrike 2
file: ./Thunderstrike 2 (USA).chd
description:
	Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq.
	Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC & Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.
	The graphics in Thunderstrike 2 are drawn completely with 3D polygons, including the helicopter's cockpit. As you track an enemy, the view changes so that it is always in your sights. There are 8 campaigns to complete, each with multiple missions.
	A blistering airborne monster of a game, offering 37 levels of arcade action viewed from the cockpit of a Thunderhawk attack helicopter. Firestorm offers all the thrills and spills of flying without the need to master the complexities of more traditional flight simulations.
	The speed and attention to detail in the graphics will hit you between the eyes, while a gentle gameplay undercurrent that calls for strategic thinking during missions - as well as for arcade-sharp reflexes - ensures that Firestorm Thunderhawk 2 will present an extended challenge to the most trigger-happy aviator. Clearly a thinking man's shoot-em-up, Firestorm also offers the fun and satisfaction of a flight sim without the learning curve and concentration needed just to stay in the air.

game: Tiny Tank
file: ./Tiny Tank (USA).chd
description:
	In a future world, an army of steel robots are out to destroy the human race. Our only hope is a little yellow tank armed with some mighty big guns. The sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years ago. Almost destroyed, at least.
	Thanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic "Fix-It Crabs" went to work and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck, strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the human race.
	STORY:
	Sometime before 2094 A.D., all of Earth's armed forces were disintegrated into one large corporation, SenTrax. SenTrax vowed to create a robot army to fight humanity's wars, so mankind itself would not have to. However, they needed the peoples' vote to set this plan into motion, and thus developed the titular "Tiny Tank" - a small yellow tank with an occasionally unfriendly attitude. The creation of this cute killing machine made SenTrax's popularity skyrocket, and won them the vote. As thanks, the corporation set up an exhibition showing their yellow mascot fighting off the entire SenTrax army on July 4, 2094, broadcast live over the Internet. However, once the event began, one of the SenTrax robots had been accidentally fitted with live ammunition and destroyed Tiny with one shot. As a result, Tiny's "positronic brain" (his artificial intelligence system) shattered, and its shards gave "life" to the entire robot army. The robot that had fired the shot, now self-aware and calling himself Mutank, took control of the rampant robots and began to eliminate humanity so that machines could thrive. Humanity was forced to evacuate into underground asteroid shelters as the mechanical army conquered the surface.
	On July 4, 2194 A.D., exactly 100 years later, Tiny Tank was finally rebuilt thanks to automated SenTrax Fix-It Crabs, which were minuscule robots made to repair broken machinery. A female artificial intelligence on board an orbital satellite reawakened Tiny, and sent him to fight Mutank's robot army and save mankind.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The player controls Tiny as he traverses many levels, eliminating SenTrax forces as he goes. There are two bars at the top of the screen that show Tiny's health and the amount of nanometal acquired. Nanometal is essential for the on-board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny. If the nanometal meter runs out, health cannot be regenerated. There is also a map on the upper right hand corner identifying the surroundings, enemies, and mission objectives.Tiny canalso pick up fallen parts from destroyed enemie.

	Players head out for an adventure with the Tiny Toons gang in Tiny Toon Adventures: Plucky's Big Adventure for PlayStation. In this title, based on the Tiny Toons animated series kids can play as Plucky, Hamton, Buster and Babs as they explore twenty-plus levels of Acme Looniversity in search of parts for a time machine for Plucky. While avoiding the incorrigible Elmyra and Montana Max, players help the gang seek out the time machine parts in order for Plucky to travel back in time to finish his homework.
	Searching all over the Looniversity in Acme Acres, players explore many places including the music room, history room, tennis courts and hallways. Items will vary from a bicycle pump to a potato and once an item is found, players can proceed with the level or return to the controlling character's respective locker to store the item. Each character can carry only three items at one time and players must decide which items are the most useful for each current level. Certain items are not time machine parts but rather will be used to acquire parts later in the game.
	Elmyra and Montana Max, the game's only obstacles, must be avoided in order to complete the game. They can each capture the character they confront and will lock them away until another character rescues them. If they capture all four characters, the game is the over. Providing players can successfully avoid the antagonistic characters, and locate all the missing time machine parts, the game is won. The game also features a handful of other Tiny Toon characters such as Dizzy and GOGO with which the main characters interact.

description:
	In this adventure based on the Tiny Toon animated series, you must help Plucky, Hamton and Furball escape a haunted mansion. Each character has a purpose. Plucky and Hamton are there to navigate the mansion and provide comic relief, while Furball activates switches and devices.
	Since the characters aren't the bravest of souls, they may run away at certain times. Other problems include Bombats, flying creatures that come in several varieties. TNT Bombats, for example, have a short fuse and will explode on contact. All enemies can be eliminated in a series of "shooting" sequences within the mansion.
	Gameplay involves moving the characters through a series of rooms where they perform different actions, such as shooting, pulling switches, taking items, and opening doors. To successfully escape the mansion, the characters will need to retrieve power cells to activate the elevator on each of the five floors.
	Plucky, Hamton and Furball from the television cartoon Tiny Toon Adventures need to escape from the spooky haunted mansion of the evil Baroness Toonenstein (played by Elmyra) where she needs their brains to build a monster. The player moves Furball through numerous rooms looking for power cell actuators needed to activate the elevators on five floors while chased by different types of evil flying Bombats which explode if they touch him.
	When the Bombat Disabler Gun is found, the view changes to a stationary sniper mode and enemies can be shot with green goo. Furball can also open doors, activate levers, and take items such as codes to a treasure vault in the basement. There are different mini-games and puzzles to solve, in order to progress. Plucky and Hamton will sometimes be too frightened and run away, and must be located.

	Tobal 2 is a sequel to Tobal Nr. 1. Like its predecessor, it is a fighting game with an additional Quest Mode, which has been expanded and added new features in this sequel.
	.
	The basic fighting gameplay is the same as in the first game, utilizing free movement in a 3D environment (provided the player character is facing the opponent) with high, medium, and low punches and kicks, as well as the trademark grappling and throwing moves. An unblockable fireball attack has been added in this installment.
	.
	The Quest Mode has undergone a significant expansion, including role-playing elements. In addition to the dungeons featured in the first game, the sequel adds an explorable town, where the main character can eat, rest, and buy supplies. An experience system has also been added. Consuming food and potions will have an effect on the character's attack and defense power. Individual attacks and body parts can be increased in strength as well.
	.
	Also new in the Quest Mode is the ability to capture encountered monsters and then use them as playable characters in the Vs. mode. The amount of playable characters in this fighting game can be therefore as high as two hundred.

game: Tobal No. 1
file: ./Tobal No. 1 (USA).chd
description:
	Tobal No. 1 is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well as Square's first release on the CD-based console.
	Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel, Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe.
	Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier.
	STORY:
	Tobal No. 1 takes place in the year 2027 on a fictional planet called Tobal, which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy source. The planet's 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game's plot and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending.
	The game's immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom, Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu, and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan's Dungeon level in the quest mode. Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the dungeon.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low attacks for each character. Tobal No. 1 also has an intuitive grappling and blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves.
	Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Tobal No. 1 is the "Quest Mode", which combines the game's fighting controls with three-dimensional dungeon exploration. The player must advance down a number of floors, contend with traps, and engage in fights with a variety of enemies including the game's playable characters. Several items can be found, dropped by enemies, or bought using crystals. These items can be picked up, consumed, or thrown at enemies, and include foodstuffs that can restore the player's HP or potions that have a range of effects including raising the player's maximum health or bringing it down to 1 point. There is no way to save one's progress, and dying means starting over from the beginning. Defeating certain characters in this mode unlocks them as playable characters in the game's other modes.
	Each of the eight initially playable characters can perform high, medium, and low attacks, and the game makes use of a grappling and blocking system that lets players execute a variety of throws and counterattacks.
	Features:
	Featuring such modes of play as "Tournament," "Vs.," and "Quest"
	Kick, punch, guard, jump, dash, and attack your way through the darkness of a dungeon to locate the Molmoran
	Select from 11 different characters including Emperor Udan, Nork, Hom, Epon, and Oliems

game: Tom and Jerry in House Trap
file: ./Tom and Jerry in House Trap.chd
description:
	It's time to experience the mishaps and adventures of Tom and Jerry's bitter rivalry. Tom and Jerry in House Trap is a split screen action adventure for one or two players. Fight your way through the pages of Jerry's new book "My Life With Tom" and follow them through all the rooms in the house finding ways to knock the other out.
	As defiant mouse Jerry, single-players move about the house setting traps for Tom the cat. As Jerry continues to set traps in one half of the split screen, players can watch the results in the other half of the screen as Tom falls victim to (or outsmarts) the traps that have already been set. If Jerry notices that Tom seems to be getting a little too close for comfort, he can also blow his dog whistle and Spike will come to chase after Tom and even the odds a bit.
	When two people play at once, one can take on the role of Tom and help him to avoid the traps that Jerry sets. The game features 15 different rooms to explore, each with its own challenges and rewards, and each successive level unlocks a new room in the house with more weapons scattered throughout. While most of the challenges involve reducing the other player's health first, some levels require rubber duckies be collected and placed in a pond. The first player to collect the required amount wins the match.
	Both Tom and Jerry have limited health that is represented by a green status bar, and can be drained by hitting them with umbrellas, cooking pans, ladles, and hammers (to name a few). Some objects, such as cakes, anvils and bottles can be thrown at the other character, while others like bombs and Jell-o molds can be dropped in their path.
	Help Jerry prove that cats aren't as smart as they look, or make Tom the envy of all the local cats by bringing Jerry in.

game: Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six
file: ./Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (USA).chd
description:
	Using a Tom Clancy storyline and characters, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for the PlayStation is an original first person 3D shooter where you take control of an elite counter-terrorist organization named Rainbow Six. After selecting one of three difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate or Special Forces), you select a team of operatives from a full roster. You can also equip your team with the appropriate weapons and equipment based on real-life munitions (even in Sniper Mode).
	To further realism you can select where each team member begins. After planning, lead your team into the mission where you get to control each member, one at a time. Also, as in real life, one shot may often maim or kill your operatives. If all of your operatives are killed, your mission ends. You must then choose to either move on with new operatives or retry the mission.
	If you complete all of your objectives you move on to the next mission for a total of 14 different missions in real world locations. In addition to the regular missions, you are also given the option to train. In the training level you can practice controlling an operative in a non-threatening environment. This is where you really get to learn some important skills. There is an assault course, a shooting range, and a training mission.
	Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six includes many real-life weapons. They include guns, grenades and kits. Some guns include: the HK MP5A2, the preferred submachine gun of counter-terrorist operatives around the world; the CAR-15, a compact M-16; and the Benelli M1, a good tactical shotgun that is an essential weapon for many teams. Other weapons include Frag Grenades, Heartbeat Sensors and Demolition Kits.
	Uniforms are another essential piece of equipment for counter-terrorists. Some include the ever-popular light, medium and heavy uniforms, the desert uniform, and the Camo uniform -- all used in different environments. The game also features real time lighting and special effects for ultimate realism.

game: Tomb Raider III: Adventures of Lara Croft
file: ./Tomb Raider III (USA).chd
description:
	The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and speed dash to help her through tough situations.
	The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past, British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive.
	With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.
	It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.
	Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail, improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting effects.
	The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any part of the adventure.

Little do you know that the quest for your bracelet will turn into so much more.
	.
	Because of its role-playing elements, in Tomba!, your character will gain experience points, develop new skills and learn new things. He has seven abilities that can be learned throughout the duration of the game. Once all three experience meters reach level ten (in order to do this, Tomba must do certain things), he will unlock and learn an ability.

Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series.
	.
	Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.

game: Top Gun: Fire at Will!
file: ./Top Gun - Fire at Will! (USA).chd
description:
	In the vein of Top Gun and Namco's acclaimed Air Combat comes Top Gun: Fire at Will! Players will assume the role of an up and coming hotshot pilot named Maverick and guide him through the Top Gun training academy. After acquiring the necessary skills, you'll begin a tour of duty with the Navy and be assigned top priority air missions!
	As a fighter pilot, you'll carry out a barrage of missions set throughout Mimar, Cuba, Korea, and Libya. Commander Honda, played by James Tolkan, will be acting as the assigning officer -- screw up and he'll gnaw on your butt and spit it out! Missions include search and destroy operations, protecting ally planes and important people, and good old-fashioned dogfights with enemy MiGs.
	Players will be manning the F-14 fighter plane. Not only does this baby come with all the necessary tools and equipment needed for survival (radar, warning lights, altitude meters), it comes with a variety of missiles; there are standard air-to-air missiles, the air-to-ground AGMs, U238s made from depleted uranium, a disastrous Nuke, and the multiple target MIRV. It also comes with some defensive tools such as chaffs and flares that trick enemy radar.
	Don't worry, you're not going in the air alone! Merlin will act as your Radar Intercept Officer; loosely translated, he's the guy that sits behind you and watches out for enemy target locks. Additionally, the sweetly calm Raven and your arch rival Stinger will assist Maverick as his wingmen. When you get in a sticky situation, count on these guys to help you out!
	Top Gun: Fire at Will features a single-player Campaign mode and an Options menu. The Options menu lets players select a difficulty level (trainee, pilot, and ace) as well as sound and music levels and various controller configurations. The Campaign is the real deal; this is where you'll be taking mission objectives and flying in the not-so-friendly skies.
	If you think you've got what it takes to blast some MiG fighter planes out of the sky, step up to the challenge in this custom PlayStation version of Top Gun: Fire at Will! On the strong of mind, intelligence, and cunning need apply.

game: Toshinden 4
file: ./Toshinden 4 (Europe).chd
description:
	The fourth game in the main Toshinden series.
	.
	Toshinden 4 attempts to return to the series roots after Toshinden 3's radical departure. As a result Toshinden 4 was "old school" for its time.
	.
	While Toshinden 4 models it's game play more off Toshinden 1 and Toshinden 2 than 3, it makes what is perhaps the biggest change in the series; it does away with nearly all of the 40+ characters that the series has built up and replaces them with 13 almost completely new characters; only 3 of Toshinden 4's cast have appeared in previous games.
	.
	But even they are notably different as Toshinden 4 takes place sometime after Toshinden 3 story wise, hence they have aged. The new cast has some pretty big links to the old cast however and many of their stories and bio's reference the old cast even though most aren't named directly (for instance Lancelot was sent to a certain French noble man to be toughened up, while Fen met a certain spear wielding warrior that his own fighting style is conveniently similar to).
	.
	Graphically, Toshinden 4 sacrifices detail for fluid animation and speed, to the point where the original Toshinden arguably looks better overall.
	.
	The combo system is once again redone; now the player can make a combo out of any combination of light and hard attacks (high, low and jumping) with the limits that they can only enter each attack once (i.e only one high light slash, one low hard kick etc) and once a hard attack has been inputted, no further light attacks can be entered into the combo.
	.
	Special attacks have also become more special, generally being considerably more dramatic and requiring more complex button combinations that the past games.
	.
	Toshinden 4 also tweaks the series overdrive attacks; now each character has at least two and the bar is split into three segments; one block is used per overdrive attack, though all three can be saved up to activate the new Kishin Kourin attack which bestows a considerable ability increase at the cost of health.
	.
	A simple parrying system has been added to Toshinden 4; the player can attempt to repel any weapon based attack or they can use a special counter attack that can counter almost anything, but uses up an overdrive block.
	.
	Toshinden 4 introduces multiple arena types to the series; for the first time there are arenas with no edges as well as the standard square and round arenas one can be knocked off for a ring out. Toshinden 4 also introduces a third type of arena to the series; collapsing arenas. As the match goes on holes randomly form in the arena (though warning is given as to where they are about to form). As if to compensate for this new arena type, it is no longer possible to fall off an edge of the ring unless you are hit off or accidently perform a move that takes you over the edge.
	.
	As well as the standard fighting aspect, Toshinden 4 also has seven time unlocked themed "mini games", that include breakout, air hockey and a dancing game.
	.
	There is also a comprehensive database mode to unlock that includes detailed information about every character, sound bites, a jute box and character design sketches including some rejected costumes.
	.
	As well as all these extras, Toshinden 4 has pretty much every fighting game mode out there.

game: Trap Gunner: Countdown to Oblivion

description:
	In Trap Gunner two opponents battle in small arenas, and while each has a relatively weak ranged and melee attack, the favored means of damaging an opponent is through hidden traps. Each combatant has at his or her disposal a range of explosives, pits, throwing panels, and gas bombs. An enemy is significantly damaged by a single trap, but one may create a sequence of traps for a devastating amount of damage.
	.
	With one of six different special agents, each a specialist in assassination and demolitions, a player may progress through a story mode consisting of several missions, a sub-boss, and a final boss. These characters are also available for custom battles against a human or the computer.

game: Trick'N Snowboarder
file: ./Trick'n Snowboarder (USA).chd
description:
	Fresh off the slopes comes Capcom's Trick'N Snowboarder exclusively for the PlayStation. It features a wide variety of distinctive and realistically designed courses ranging from two different half-pipes and a snowboard park to Alpine courses and a large jump ramp specifically used for stunts and tricks. There are also a few hidden goodies/tracks waiting to be unlocked!
	In addition to the various tracks, there are a few different gameplay options including the Scenario, Versus, Edit, and Free modes. The Scenario mode has the player assuming the role of an up and coming snowboarding star. After joining the Extreme Tour, he sets off an adventure of fame and fortune; players travel around the world competing in various tournaments while gathering material for a snowboarding video.
	Winning competitions and getting good footage will depend on the player's ability to perform exciting stunts and tricks. Everything found in the actual sport of snowboarding has been included; players are able to execute 360s, grab, and flip their snowboard. Don't confine yourself to just one aerial maneuver -- mix them up and keep the stunts interesting!
	When players aren't filming their movie and trying to get extraordinary stunts on film, other challenges await. The Versus mode pits two players in a heated one-on-one battle for ultimate snowboarding supremacy. Played from either a horizontal or split screen viewpoint, the object is to either get more points than your friend or finish a course in the quickest amount of time.
	For the creative types, Capcom included an Edit mode in which players may customize any given snowboarder. Don't like the clothing and/or color scheme? Change them! Think that character would look better with a different brand of snowboard? Roll with it -- it's up to you and your imagination! The customized snowboarder can then be used in any of the gameplay options including a Free mode in which players are given absolute freedom to practice courses and/or tricks.
	Trick'N Snowboarder supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller by incorporating both analog control and the vibration function into gameplay. Players may also utilize a Memory Card for saving data, Scenario mode progression and customized snowboarders.

game: Turnabout
file: ./Turnabout (USA).chd
description:
	While the old adage that "turnabout is fair play" applies in many situations, Natsume's Turnabout is all about diabolical puzzles where players rotate the entire puzzle while the pieces move within its borders, sliding and rolling into mind-numbing configurations and patterns. The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.
	Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen "steps," even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode.
	Features:
	* One hundred puzzles with moving balls and sliding blocks
	* Create up to 50 additional custom puzzles in edit mode
	* Background, sound, and music options allow customization of playing fields

description:
	Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist.  In day-to-day life, she's quite timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away!  Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.
	.
	In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.  The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance.
	.
	Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy's guitar.

	As one of the rebels, the player has to maneuver the tank on a battlefield, searching for suitable places to construct reinforcements buildings. After entering a piece of terrain marked with four glowing orbs, a large structure topped by a turret called "The Citadel" appears on a nearby spot. The player can enter it by pressing both L1 and R1 buttons, assuming the role of the turret operator. Besides handling the weapons, the player can access the build menu, from where unit factories can be erected on the surrounding terrain. Extra turrets can also be placed around the perimeter to protect the base. The structures can be recycled to be replaced with new ones.
	.
	The tank is equipped with several weapons, from laser beams to guided missiles, that can be used against enemy troops. From the inside, friendly units can be summoned when available to fight alongside in battle. Infantry, tanks and aircraft can be called into action from the interface menu. A tactical map showing an overhead view of the terrain can be activated with the select button.
	.
	There are three split-screen modes for two players: challenge, deathmatch and siege. The first two have the players fighting directly against each other, while the last one is more strategic, where the objective is to defend the base from incoming enemy assaults.

game: Urban Chaos
file: ./Urban Chaos (USA).chd
description:
	As the 2nd millennium ends, the cities are over-ran with Apocalyptic violence. Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage.
	.
	This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.

game: V.I.P.
file: ./V.I.P. (USA).chd
description:
	Based on the syndicated series starring Pamela Anderson, V.I.P. for the PlayStation offers a mixture of first-person shooting action and hand-to-hand combat. The female bodyguard team led by Vallery Irons is entangled in a mob vendetta while protecting their client Dr. Kindle. After Irons and Kindle are captured, the rest of the team must advance through a series of indoor and outdoor levels to rescue them. Featured characters include ex-spy Tasha Dexter, explosives expert Nikki Franco, former boxer Quick Williams, martial arts specialist Johnny Loh, and computer hacker Kay Simmons.
	.
	Fighting sequences are controlled differently than in traditional fighting games, as players perform combination attacks by inputting a series of onscreen commands. If the sequence is entered within the time frame, the character will carry out the moves and damage the enemy. Play then continues until all the enemies in a level are defeated. The shooting stages are structured in a manner similar to Lethal Enforcers or Time Crisis, with players guiding a cross-hair target on the screen to shoot down enemies. Ten mini-games are also available in between missions, offering a variety of timed puzzles to complete before advancing to the next stage.

game: Vagrant Story
file: ./Vagrant Story (USA).chd
description:
	Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what's going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda.
	.
	Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.
	.
	The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them.
	.
	Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.

game: Valkyrie Profile
file: ./Valkyrie Profile (USA).m3u
description:
	In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.
	.
	The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.
	.
	The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs.

game: Vampire Hunter D
file: ./Vampire Hunter D (USA).chd
description:
	Vampire Hunter D for the PlayStation is based on the anime titled Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.  That anime is based on the novel title Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase written by Hideyuki Kikuchi.  You play as D, the half-human / half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires.  The setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century, instead D's adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has nearly killed itself off by endless wars.  Rising from the scorched earth and assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires.  They established a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over their peasants.  But after thousands of years the Vampires' power waned and humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were born.
	.
	In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her.  He is not the only one trying to free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival.  The Vampire Hunter D must enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty.
	.
	The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games for the PlayStation.  There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are animated in 3D.  Players utilize D's signature weapon, his massive long sword, as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith.  You must solve puzzles, unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the strings of this macabre story.

It's a tried-and-true method of laying on the action, and while there were plenty of opportunities for Asmik to screw up the formula, but luckily, they never really dropped the ball, at least not when it came to the shooter parts.

game: Vandal Hearts
file: ./Vandal Hearts (USA).chd
description:
	Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG. It follows a fixed plot-line with set battles, focusing more on strategic elements than adventure elements.
	.
	The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).
	.
	In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.

game: Vandal Hearts II
file: ./Vandal Hearts II (USA).chd
description:
	Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.
	.
	Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.
	.
	The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.

game: Vanishing Point
file: ./Vanishing Point (USA).chd
description:
	Vanishing Point is an arcade-style racing game that revolves around unlocking cars and tracks by progressing through tournament heats. As the game begins, the only available cars are a Ford Mustang Cobra SVT or Ford Explorer, and there's only one track on which to race. But earning first-place finishes unlocks additional tracks, cars like the Audi TT, BMW 325i and Dodge Viper GTS, and extra features such as the Tune-Up Shop.
	The other major feature of the game is Stunt Driver mode, which consists of a series of timed challenges like jumps and slalom courses. The faster you complete each challenge, the most stunt points you receive to go towards unlocking additional stunts. Single Race and Time Trial modes are also available.
	The only initially playable two-player mode is Single Race, but two additional challenges called Balloon Buster and Chicken can be unlocked. Balloon Buster has you racing on a track filled with colored balloons. Popping balloons of your color subtracts a second from your time, while popping an opponent's adds two seconds. Chicken pits two racers on a track going in opposite directions.
	Three or more players can compete in League play or Winner Stays On (in which the winner keeps racing as long as they keep winning), and four or eight players can compete in the tournament-like Knockout mode. The Internet Challenge lets you create an online profile and see how you rank against other players by competing in online-specific challenges. This mode does not include head-to-head racing over the Internet.

	* Race against the clock on urban roads, avoiding traffic and competitors

game: Viewpoint
file: ./Viewpoint (USA).chd
description:
	Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter, released in 1992 by SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade platform. By default, 1P and 2P can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled.
	The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same.
	Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.
	One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.
	Viewpoint features six robot riddled worlds set throughout a three-quarter perspective. Growing in complexity as the game progresses, the levels have been rendered with computer-generated SGI textures, enemies, and various explosion effects. At the end of certain levels, players will square off against large mechanized bosses.
	Far into the future of mankind's existence, the world is being threatened by its own mechanical creations. After being banished to the 31st sector of the galaxy, the Ralfedacc has began orbiting around Earth. Those in the death orb more commonly known as the Director of the Dark have created destructive robots that will be deployed on the seemingly helpless planet; their ultimate objective is revenge.
	Naturally, you've been selected as the Byupo probe pilot that will save the world; no pressure, eh? A Byupo is a small yet powerful fighter ship capable of mass devastation; it can pick up and use various weapons and utilize special items. Your mission objective is short and to the point: pilot your craft with a quick trigger finger throughout six key battle areas.
	The Byupo can obtain sidecars, or helper items and/or weapons, during each levels. Players can utilize homing bombs that targets enemies in clusters, the wall of flame that emits from a dropped fire bomb, and a wave bomb that sends out a lightning attack. Additionally, power bubbles equip your shooter with temporary shields and the bonus Byupo acts as an extra-life.
	But watch out -- there are a variety of traps and hazards built to terminate your quest. In addition to trap doors, the enemies have erected draw gates to hamper your progress. You'll have to destroy the wheel locks if you wish to make it through the gate. The Gears of Gore move on tracks and do devastating amounts of damage; avoid these at all costs!

	Wanted is a game released by Phoenix as a cheap title for the Playstation one console and the gameplay is similar to arcade games Blood Bross or Cabal (but without the 2 players mode), in the part that the character is viewed from behind and the player has to defeat all the enemies in each level to advance to the next one.
	In the game the player takes the role of the sheriff of a town in the wild west age and you have to shoot the enemies until reaching the number requird to end the level. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen decreased as foes are killed.
	The bad parts of the game is that looks more like a demo than to a complete game due to the lack of music and 'cause that the player doesn't have a good control method since he can hide from the enemy bullets or roll to avoid them.

description:
	The player gets to play as NORAD or WOPR. According to the game's cover box, the story takes place 20 years after the film: WOPR attempts to exterminate humanity and NORAD tried to stop it. During a mission the player takes control of a vehicle and can change the controls of any vehicle the team has - for example, while NORAD has heavily armored and armed tanks and aircraft, WOPR possesses exotically futuristic mechs and hovercraft. Vehicles could recharge ammo by obtaining powers. A unique feature in the game allows the player to command their team to send resupply on ammos or repair damage units. The game allows the player to command teammates to attack or follow the player's main vehicle.

description:
	War Gods is a one-on-one fighting game that takes place in 3D environments. The fighter under your control can perform many different moves, and string those moves together to perform "combos."  Furthermore, the fighters all have special "finishing moves" that eliminate your opponent in some gruesome manner at the end of a match.  There are 10 different fighters to choose from, all based on different ancient civilizations.
	.
	The graphics in War Gods are fairly unique. They were created by texture-mapping 3D character models with digitized photos of people.  This gives them a reasonably lifelike look.

game: Warcraft II: The Dark Saga
file: ./WarCraft II - The Dark Saga (USA).chd
description:
	Warcraft II: The Dark Saga brings the successful Warcraft series to the console world, delivering medieval orc vs. human combat to those that haven't been able to enjoy the PC version. Warcraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires players to build up orc and human forces by building structures and creating units for combat. The main objective is to take control of one race and wipe the other one completely off of the map.
	The console version of Warcraft II sports some changes from its PC predecessor. First and foremost, both the original version of Warcraft II as well as the expansion pack are included. This means twice as many maps and four separate campaigns, giving players 52 different missions split between the races. Other additions include six new full-motion video cut-scenes, and the ability to group sixteen units instead of nine. Also included are extra production options, meaning that if you control multiple bases, it will be easier to maintain one while focusing your attention on the other.
	While Warcraft II: The Dark Saga only features single-player missions, players can create their own maps, as well as use custom mission maps that the game includes to make their own scenarios.

game: Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat
file: ./Warhammer - Shadow of the Horned Rat (USA).chd
description:
	Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat offers over 25 different troop types, 20 spells and nine characteristics for each regiment: movement, weapon skill, ballistic skill, strength, toughness, wounds, initiative, attack and leadership ability. In order to save campaign progress, players must have a memory card with at least one block free.
	.
	Battles consist of two phases: deployment and real-time fighting. Deployment allows you to position your regiments within an area designated by white flags. This involves turning them to face certain enemies, issuing orders to attack, move (including setting waypoints and patrol loops) or simply hold ground.
	.
	Combat involves charging the enemy, using magical spells (if available) or firing long-range weapons, such as arrows or catapults. Of course, line of sight and terrain will influence how successful your attacks are, and the emotion level (fear, hatred or frenzy) as well as the experience of your troops will also play a significant role. Each battlefield can also hold various magic items that may help in future battles.

	Warhawk is an action/simulation game built around a futuristic VTOL craft. The player maneuvers with 360 degrees of flight control through 6 unique levels.
	Take to the skies over desert and volcanic planets, through ancient castles and towers, and against massive airships in WarHawk. As a member of the Strikeforce Omicron, your goal is to wipe out the aggressive forces of Kreel. You will have complete 360 degree movement over large 3D worlds as you evade or attack in any direction: reverse, bank left or right, dive, barrel-roll, perform loops or even use the Immelmann turn to blast enemies out of the sky.
	Fire deadly lock-on missiles, rockets, multi-fire swarmers, plasma cannons and more to take down enemy ships and ground units. An orchestral soundtrack will set the mood while you engage in dogfights, and four different camera angles (cockpit, near chase, far chase and a cinema-style view) let you customize the action as you see fit. In total, there are over 25 areas of combat set within six zones: Desert Zone, Canyon Zone, Airship Zone, Volcanic Zone, Gauntlet Zone and Storm Zone.
	There are no saving or loading features. Instead, a password is presented each time a level is completed. In 2007 Incognito Entertainment remade the title as a multiplayer-only PlayStation 3 game.

description:
	Warriors of Might and Magic is another entry in the Might and Magic line from 3DO. It is a single-player action-adventure title, in much the same vein of the previous entry in the series, Crusaders of Might and Magic. It is the first Might and Magic game to appear on the PlayStation 2.
	Players take on the role of Alleron, who has been plucked from his life by mysterious forces that seek only to bring him to his final fate. His face has been encased in a mysterious and shameful mask that he cannot remove. With it, he has set out on a quest to discover the truth behind his imprisonment, along the way becoming wrapped up in an adventure that will determine the fate of the very world.
	Alleron will quest through nine different worlds in hopes of finding his persecutors, the chief of which just might be the Grand Inquisitor, who has much knowledge of the mask Alleron bares. To make it through these worlds, Alleron has several different kinds of attacks at his disposal. He has traditional melee weapons, such as swords, axes, clubs, and maces to slice and dice the demonic hordes that stand in his way. He'll also borrow some power from the realms of magic, indulging in a spell system that will allow him to give himself power-ups and eradicate pesky monsters that block his path.
	Alleron can upgrade his armor and weapons, and he'll need it, with over 30 different varieties of monsters to face. But dark creatures aren't his only obstacle in this journey, as he'll also have to deal with deceptive and shady characters, solve puzzles, and hone his weapon and spell skills. It could be a long haul for Alleron, but the prospect of being trapped in the mask forever is much worse a fate.
	Features:
	- Lead Alleron through nine 3D worlds
	- Wield melee weapons and cast magic spells against more than 30 monster breeds
	- Upgrade and enhance a wide variety of weapons, armor, and magic

game: WCW Backstage Assault
file: ./WCW Backstage Assault (USA).chd
description:
	World Championship Wrestling, Inc. (WCW) was an American professional wrestling promotion which existed from 1988 to 2001.
	WCW Backstage Assault is a professional wrestling video game by Electronic Arts. It was the final World Championship Wrestling (WCW) game released before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).
	WCW Backstage Assault takes over 50 WCW wrestlers out of the ring and into real-world venues like a locker room, garage and a loading dock. Traditional wrestling moves can be used, but weapons like two-by-fours and trash cans are also thrown into the mix. By working your way through the game's various modes, you can unlock additional wrestlers, areas and weapons. Bobby Heenan and Tony Schiavone provide the commentary with over 8,000 lines of dialogue.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Backstage Assault is vastly different from other games of its genre. Any wrestling game prior to it that featured backstage areas (such as the SmackDown! series or its predecessor, WCW Mayhem) treated them as auxiliary fighting locations. Backstage Assault took the concept further by removing the ring entirely and having all action take place backstage.
	Hardcore Challenge is Backstage Assault's primary gameplay mode. It consists of winning matches against random opponents until challenged by the champion.
	Throughout the game, players can unlock wrestlers, arenas, and moves for use in Create-a-Superstar. The player cannot defend the championship after earning it.
	Features:
	Choose from more than 50 WCW stars in an assortment of match types
	Fight in a total of 14 backstage areas, including a semi-trailer lot
	Use power-ups, weapons, and the environment to defeat your rivals

	WCW Mayhem is based on Ted Turner's hit cable wrestling league World Championship Wrestling. The game takes many of it's wrestlers and combines them with authentic moves, settings, and actual events found on the various cable programs and pay-per-view specials.
	"Mayhem" is probably an accurate word to describe the first wrestling game from Electronic Arts. A TV-style presentation features play-by-play commentary along with signature entrances enhanced by pyrotechnics and theme music. Over 50 professional wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling are included, although you'll need to play through the "Quest for the Best" mode to unlock them all.
	"Quest for the Best" has you advancing through three divisions in an attempt to win the TV title, the U.S. title, and the WCW Heavyweight Championship.

	Additional options include a "Quick Start" game, a "Main Event" match, and the ability to design custom grapplers in the "Create Wrestler" mode. As the title suggests, WCW Mayhem is not limited to the confines of the ring. Thirteen backstage areas are available, including locker rooms, boiler rooms, first-aid rooms, and hallways. Various weapons are also included for use against your opponent, from tasers and baseball bats to standard chairs and trashcans.
	Individual matches can be customized to include the following types of play: Singles, or one-on-one fights; Handicap, where a single player takes on a two-wrestler tag team; Triangle, which pits three wrestlers against each other; Four Way Dance, where four wrestlers fight to be the last man standing; Battle Royal, which involves throwing as many wrestlers over the ropes as possible; and Tag Team, which is a two-on-two contest.

game: WCW vs. the World
file: ./WCW vs. The World (USA).chd
description:
	WCW vs. the World (known in Japan as Virtual Pro-Wrestling) is a professional wrestling video game released in 1997 for the PlayStation video game console. It was the first game developed by The Man Breeze (who later became the AKI Corporation) to be released outside of Japan and the second wrestling game for the PlayStation, following Power Move Pro Wrestling. WCW vs. the World marks the first title in the Japanese Virtual Pro-Wrestling series and would be the first World Championship Wrestling video game released during its rise amidst the Monday Night Wars.
	This is one of the original wrestling games for the Sony Playstation. It is the second title created, following Power Move Pro Wrestling. The game has a variety of characters from all over the world. There are 15 WCW Superstars (superstars at the time the game was created, anyway), and 60 wrestlers under aliases in the game. These wrestlers are from around the world, many in Japan, some even from the WWF. They are not under their real name because THQ did not have the copyright to them.
	The game itself consists of many modes. You control one wrestler at a time, and can take part in any of the following: League Challenge, fight for the belt in a league; Best of Seven, select seven opponents and fight for a new belt; Exhibition, pick any wrestlers and fight; Elimination, choose five wrestlers each, and winner stays on; Tournament, select up to eight wrestlers and battle; League, round-robin, winner is wrestler with most points; and Double Title, two wrestlers fight, winner wins both belts.
	The game features 51 wrestlers. In addition to its WCW/nWo roster, in keeping with the game's title, WCW vs. the World also has several "fictional" foreign wrestlers. These performers are actually renamed counterparts of real-life Japanese wrestlers that could not be properly represented in the game's American version due to copyright restrictions. This practice of altering Japanese performers for American games would carry on through two more AKI games for the Nintendo 64.

	The game is the sequel to WCW Nitro, WCW/NWO Thunder and features 60 professional wrestlers to play as or against, including Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, and Diamond Dallas Page. Eleven play modes are available, from standard tournaments to deadly steel cage matches. The three main tournaments differ in the number of opponents you'll confront: five, seven, or ten different wrestlers from the WCW league.
	Other match types include exhibition, versus, tag team, battle royal, and cage match. While the majority of modes are single matches for practice or fun against the computer or a friend, battle royal is notable for its inclusion of 29 wrestlers. Whoever lasts the longest without being eliminated is declared the winner. Adjustable options include match lengths, group allegiances, ring-out times, difficulty, weapons, and controls.
	Fifteen different 3D rings are included, modeled after such authentic WCW events as the Spring Stampede and Starcade. Additionally, each wrestler's ring entrance, theme music, and signature-style rants have been captured in full-motion video for your viewing pleasure. Tony Schiavone and Mike Tenay offer up grapple-by-grapple, move-for-move commentary while you battle inside the ring.

He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...
	.
	The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game.
	.
	"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.

	The protagonist of the previous two games was officially assigned a name in WCIII, Colonel Christopher Blair (Mark Hamill). The opening cutscene, the first FMV cutscene in the Wing Commander series, depicts a saddening scene: Thrakhath nar Kiranka (John Rhys-Davies), Crown Prince of the hostile Kilrathi Empire, presiding over the execution by disintegration of a group of Terran Confederation prisoners of war. One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover Colonel Jeannette "Angel" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the game). The scene then cuts to the planet Vespus, where Blair and Brigadier General James "Paladin" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.

game: Wolf Fang: Kuuga 2001
file: ./Wolf Fang (Japan).chd
description:
	Wolf Fang known outside of Japan as Rohga: Armor Force, is a 1991 run and gun/platform hybrid arcade game developed and published by Data East. It is the sequel to Vapor Trail: Hyper Offence Formation and was followed by Skull Fang Kuhga Gaiden.
	STORY:
	Two years have passed since the military occupation of New York City in 1999 and since then Ragnarok (aka: DAGGER) - the organization responsible for the events - have disappeared following their air borne destruction. During that time, mech technology has been the boom of future military projects worldwide with the biggest factories residing in Oceania. These mechs become the main target of Ragnarok when it resurfaces and claims the military factories and cities of Australia and New Zealand. Their plan is to apparently use any and all of the deadliest mechs that have not yet reached completion to their chaotic liking.
	The USAF and RAAF organize a strike force to reclaim major attacked points in the two countries with the assistance of the best mech operators they can find. Players then assume the role of mech-fighters who aim to liberate Australia or, depending on the player's actions, New Zealand.
	GAMEPLAY:
	Wolf Fang plays very much like a scrolling horizontal shooter in which players are set on a scrolling background and must destroy every enemy in their path. However, because the players control a mech, the players can hover against slanted walls in the back ground and occasionally land on higher platforms
	Players start along the shores of Australia and proceed to Sydney before being allowed to choose where to go from there. If players continue to explore Australia, then they will have a variety of places to choose from while if they pick New Zealand then they will have even more, different levels to choose from with different settings.
	PSX Version:
	Wolf Fang was ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996 and 1997 respectively by conversion company Xing (famous for the arcade port collection known as Arcade Gears).
	The console versions have added features such as a new title screen, new introduction, an arranged soundtrack and a staff roll after the endings. The arcade versions outside Japan however, have a number of things cut. There is no story intermissions between the stages and there is no stage selection leading to 4 different endings found on the Japanese version, but the game cycles through all 12 stages like in the Japanese version's expert mode.

description:
	Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.
	.
	Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.

game: Worms World Party
file: ./Worms World Party (USA).chd
description:
	Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy game. Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.

file: ./WWF SmackDown! (USA).chd
description:
	THQ managed to wrest the WWF license away from Acclaim for no less than ten years (as of 2000). THQ then went to the respected Japanese wrestling game developer Yuke's Co., Ltd, who produces the Toukon Retsuden series, and told them to make a game worthy of The Rock. WWF SmackDown! was the result of this collaboration.
	Based on the prime time UPN WWF television show that made its debut in September of 1999, WWF SmackDown! tries to capture all elements of the typical WWF broadcast. While all the usual mayhem involved within the ring is present, including a Season mode, I Quit matches, Falls Count Anywhere and the like, the game takes a more global approach to the WWF as it also offers a story mode. Now you'll be able to directly experience the backstage drama that is an integral part of a WWF broadcast. You'll develop rivalries, make allies and try to defend your best interests.
	You'll be get the chance to play as over 30 of the top WWF superstars from the year 2000.

You'll also get to create your own wrestlers with the Create a Wrestler Mode, and unlock hidden personalities and wrestlers during extended Season mode play.
	Players will also get a variety of arenas and backstage areas to face off in as they enter the Smackdown Hotel. You'll be able to feel the electricity as you throw your opponent up the ramp and drag his pathetic carcass off to the kitchen, the parking lot, or even the boiler room.
	So know your role and get ready to bow down to the masters. The people's game has arrived, so get ready to "layeth the smacketh down" on the entire WWF roster present in the game. To be in the game, you have to beat the game.
	Features:
	- Play through the story and make decisions that alter the story, tag teams and rivalries

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.
	Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.
	Step into the ring with eight of the biggest stars in the WWF including Brett The Hitman Hart and the Undertaker. Wear down the opposition with standard wrestling moves, and then climb the ropes for some high-flying action. If you are taking a beating, you can quickly turn things around by using one of the character-specific special moves. Try to stake your claim on the championship belt in WWF WRESTLEMANIA: The Arcade Game.

file: ./X-Com - UFO Defense (USA).chd
description:
	After an outbreak of UFO sightings and alien abductions, panic spread like wildfire across the globe. What exactly was happening? Have aliens come to take over Earth? Realizing the need to address the situation, delegates from the world's superpowers gathered in Geneva to decide on a plan of action.
	An agreement was reached to form a secret group to investigate this potential alien threat, and if necessary, use deadly force to stop them. This covert organization would be called the Extraterrestrial Combat unit (X-COM for short), composed of the most talented pilots, troops, scientists and engineers the world had to offer.
	X-COM: UFO Defense is based on the 1994 PC game originally developed by Mythos Games Ltd. The player assumes control of the X-COM task force, building bases and tracking various UFOs on a 3D map of Earth. Once a UFO is spotted (represented by a red cross), you must try to intercept it so that it crashes over dry land. You'll then need to send your heavily armed squad to the site, where you'll witness the downed craft and surrounding terrain from an isometric perspective.
	Moving your troops is accomplished through a point-and-click interface with each side alternating turns. Your three goals are to (1) engage the aliens face to face, (2) either stun or kill them, and (3) retrieve whatever technology or weapons you find so your scientists can replicate them. After all, you have to fight fire with fire! The PlayStation version supports both the mouse and memory card, with the latter allowing you to save the game at any point (as long as you have five blocks free).

game: X2: No Relief
file: ./X2 - No Relief (Europe).chd
description:
	X2 is the sequel only released on Playstation of one of the best shooters on Commodore Amiga: Project-X.
	Project-X is a scrolling shooter game for the Amiga computer released in 1992. It was also ported to DOS. Developed and published by Team17, it was regarded as one of the best shooter games for that platform at the time, both for its technical excellence in graphics and sounds, and for its difficult and interesting gameplay[citation needed]. The game resembles Konami's side-scrolling shooter games such as Gradius, Salamander and Parodius.
	X2, sometimes known as Project X-2 is a simple but technically impressive, arcade-style side scrolling shoot 'em up released during the Team17-Ocean collaboration era of video games that created the Worms series. It is the sequel to the Amiga 16-bit shooter Project-X.
	Unlike many other games of the era, it was never released to a home computer audience and was fairly poorly received[citation needed]: this was mainly due to 2D scrolling shooters losing appeal in general public eye at the end of the Nineties, in favor of 3D games.
	The game was released in Eastern territories by Capcom, who handle such releases for many Western games including Grand Theft Auto III. Capcom and Team17 worked together to make the game more palatable for the Eastern market.
	The game's plot is about an alien invasion on earth and the player controls the only one (or 2 if he choose the 2 player game) who can stop it.
	The game features 10 levels and a final level of fast paced action and really difficult gameplay. Huge boss monsters at the end of each level. Each enemy wave is different, memorizing patterns won't help you... Team17 claims there is absolutely NO slowdown in this game, even in two player co-op mode!

	Grab your Chakram and sword, because the evil sorceress Kalabrax has broken free after centuries of imprisonment. She will finally get her revenge upon the gods who imprisoned her and the world they created. Only one thing is stopping her. In order for her spell to gain ultimate power to work she must sacrifice a queen.
	Unfortunately for Xena, it would appear that Gabrielle is the sacrifice de jour, being Queen of the Amazons and all. So with the help of her allies, who just happen to be Xena's bitter enemies, she has captured Gabrielle and it's up to Xena, Warrior Princess to save her.
	It won't be easy though. Nothing for Xena ever is. She will have to journey far and wide before she can face Kalabrax. She must defeat the vile King Valarian and his cronies as well as Narsus the evil renegade Amazon, and a host of other creatures like a cyclops and dragon just to name a few.
	Developed by Universal Studios Digital Arts, Xena: Warrior Princess is one experience you won't forget as you must defeat all the enemies on a stage, solve puzzles and save a few hapless villagers before you can continue on your journey. You have all of Xena's trademark moves and weapons at your disposal, including her classic warrior scream.
	Will it be enough to save Gabrielle from becoming an ingredient in Kalabrax's evil spell? Can you save the world? Do you really want to save the gods? There's really no choice; you must stop Kalabrax before all you hold dear crumbles in an instant.
	Safe journey! Battle on, Xena...

	After losing his memory, Fei Fong Wong found himself in the small town of Lahan. Because he couldn't remember who he really was or where he came from, he decided to stay there and teach martial arts and paint -- one of his personal hobbies. After his arrival, he became friends with the various townsfolk, who in return treated him like one of their own. Still, who he was and what happened to him in his past bothered him; he was afraid it would come back to haunt him one of these days.
	And it did. One day, an organization in control of large Gears, mechanized robots built for war purposes, came into the small town of Lahan. Fei was at the center of attention and with no hesitation jumped into a nearby Gear and started fighting back. The villagers were scared to death as he began to destroy the threatening enemies; he also aided in the destruction of the town. Enraged at the way he had handled himself, the townsfolk exiled Fei from the village with his only friend being an inventor named Citan.

game: Xevious 3D/G+

description:
	In Xevious 3-D/G+, you pilot a sleek Solvalou space fighter blasting and bombing your way through an overwhelming alien invasion force consisting of airborne attackers, ground defenses, and enormous "boss" motherships.
	Based on the premise that aliens who originally settled Earth have returned (and they're not happy about the proliferation of the human race, go figure), Xevious 3-D/G+ is a 3-D remake of the original Namco classic Xevious (licensed to Atari in the early 1980s).
	The new game sticks to the basic concepts of the original Xevious, right down to the familiar overhead view. Power-ups offer new weapons such as constant-fire, electrocution beams and wide-dispersal lasers --- but along with new weapons come new enemies and new bosses who aren't quite so easy to eliminate.
	Included as a bonus are the original Xevious, emulated to perfection (a nice addition since the only other PlayStation version available is on the rather hard-to-find Namco Museum Volume 2), and the only console version available of Xevious Arrangement, a more obscure coin-up conversion designed to vex those who had plowed their way through the original.

game: Z
file: ./Z (Europe).chd
description:
	Z is a eeal-time strategy game with a difference: you fight for control of the sectors, some of which contains manufactories which can gain you additional units. Touch the "flag" in the sector and it's yours. Capture the sector before the new unit comes out of the manufactory and the new unit is yours. With six different robots (different armaments and armor and speed), multiple vehicles (from jeeps to tanks) the robots can utilize, your ultimate objective is to destroy the opponent's base... And prevent him from doing the same to you...
	Z differs from other RTSs by emphasizing territorial control (and the manufactories) instead of getting kills and gathering a bit army. You have finely balance defense and offense. If you wait too long enemy will grab all the manufactories first. If you go too fast you'll get hammered for stretching yourself too thin. You can hijack enemy vehicles by shooting the driver off. If you send a group of soldiers toward an objective and they find a vehicle, one of them will split off to grab the vehicle. It's these little touches that makes Z an underappreciated title, as you don't really need to micromanage each soldier.

	In Zero Divide 2 the eight robotic fighters from Zero Divide (Zero, Tau, Wild 3, IO, Eos, Cygnus, Draco, and Nereid) are back, joined by nurse bot Pixel, the crab-like Cancer, "cyber trooper" Nox, and Eve, a female version of the last game's boss.
	What is new is that the graphical "breakability" of the robots' bodies has changed. The characters' shells actually burst apart instead of just revealing the burning, flickering wires inside - as before, this damage makes them more vulnerable to damage if hit again in the same area.
	One advance that Zero Divide boasts over its predecessor is the ability to save up to 200 match replays on the PlayStation memory card.
	STORY:
	In the year 20xx, each nation of the world's information facility was shaken up by the enigma hacker group's alias, [XTAL TOWER] incident. The end result was to destroy the the suspected life program, which had the power to control libraries. As a result, the chaos of information was suppressed to a minimum. From the data gained at the time of destruction of [XTAL], information on the hackers, the ones that are thought to have performed the crime, has been recovered. Using this information, each nation's information facility have conducted an investigation of world-wide scope. They spent a year in chasing the hackers that were running from place to place. In the end, they finally gained specifics on the criminals, and arrested four hackers from various parts of the world.
	It looked as if this was the end of everything. However, the principal offender known as [EXE] as he calls himself, started to tell a dreadful truth during the examination. Their true purpose was not network terrorism, rather through the medium obtained by [XTAL TOWER] , to release the program called [EVE]. On the network, there exists an enormous wealth of knowledge and information.
	This [EVE] uses that information for "itself", and has the will to think for "itself", making it the ultimate Life Reality Program. To stop the existence of this [EVE], the only way is for them to access the [Aggresive Nature Program]. These programs still are self-evolving somewhere over the network, even after the destruction of [XTAL].

	With Choro Q 3 Takara and Tamsoft finally managed to reach the zenith of their Choro Q license. This racing game is, without a doubt, the best one in the Choro Q series.
	The gameplay is where Choro Q3 shines. The Choro Q cars have very short wheelbases, so they have different physics than cars in other racing games. In order to succeed here, you have to re-learn how to drive.
	The parts the player starts with are supposed to be inferior to some of the ones you will get later on. As you win more races, you'll gain enough money to soup up your tiny car to be quick and agile.
	Buying new parts for your car is part of the fun. There are more parts in this game than any other Choro Q game on the Playstaton. There are many different types of tires, like Racing, Semi-Racing, Off-Road, Water, Snow, and Big Tires (think Monster Trucks). There are lots of engines, transmissions and brakes, too. You can get spoilers, new chassises, and even horns and speedometers. There is a high degree of customization here.

game: Family Diamond
file: ./Family Diamond (Japan) (En).chd
description:
	Chinese checkers (alternate spelling Chinese chequers) is a strategy board game which can be played by two, three, four, or six people, playing individually or with partners. The game is a modern and simplified variation of Halma.
	The objective is to be first to race one's pieces across the hexagram-shaped gameboard into "home" the corner of the star opposite one's starting corner?using single-step moves or moves which jump over other pieces. Others keep playing to establish 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and last place finishers. Like other skill-based games, Chinese checkers involves strategy. The rules are simple, however, so even young children can play.
	Family Diamond is a very basic digital version of Chinese checkers. The goal (just like in the board game) is to move your marbles across the board to the opposite site and, if possible, use you opponents' marbles to get further each turn. This game has no extras or special effects, it's just good old fashioned board gaming.
	You can play alone or against a friend and face computer opponents.

	One night, Goemon awakens from his sleep to some huge noise, so he and Ebisumaru decide to go and investigate. The pair find out that it's an alien, and that Edo's being invaded!
	This is the first Goemon game since Sasuke and Yae's appearance as playable characters that doesn't include either on the playable roster. Instead, they are replaced by the new characters Goroku and Baban. Although Sasuke and Yae are playable characters again in most future games and Goroku and Baban are never seen, mentioned or heard from again after this game. Its unknown why they never appear again, but it is assumed that many fans were upset over Sasuke and Yae being replaced.
	Gameplay is rather similar to Ganbare Goemon 3, as there's a main map in top-down perspective, which leads to various 2-D sidescrolling levels.

file: ./Grandia (Japan) (Undub v2.0).m3u
description:
	All texts are in English. All voices are in Japanese (100% battles and fields). All cutscenes are in Japanese subtitle English.
	.
	Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.
	.
	The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.
	.
	The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.

game: Moorhuhn 2: Die Jagd Geht Weiter
file: ./Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd Geht Weiter (Japan) (En v1.1).chd
description:
	Moorhuhn (distributed as Crazy Chicken in English-speaking countries) is a German casual game franchise for PCs and the Nintendo DS. It consists of more than 30 games, the first of which - a shoot 'em up - was Germany's most popular computer game in the early 2000s. Originally the star of an promotional campaign for undrinkable whiskey Jack Daniels, Moorhunh has starred in over thirty games during the years, including five kart racing games.
	Moorhuhn 2 - Die Jagd Geht Weiter gameplay is like the first Moorhuhn game, the hunter in front of the screen must shoot down as many grouse as possible in 90 seconds. This generates points. That's it. Simple, but effective!
	Certain basic principles remain the same: 90 seconds, grouse flying around the landscape, shooting the above (the grouse, not the landscape!!!) yields points.
	That was enough for part one, but there had to be more in the sequel. So the game this time is filled with loads of hidden puzzles to solve in order to spur on the fans' passion for the hunt.

game: Klaymen Klaymen: Neverhood no Nazo
file: ./Neverhood, The (Japan) (En).chd
description:
	The Neverhood is an incredibly amusing adventure game that has a unique twist. This is one of the only games, if not the only game done entirely in claymation, which is what makes it so strange. The team working on this game put an astounding amount of attention to the animation of all the characters and objects within the game, giving it a very bizarre and cartoony look. It's clear that a lot of time and effort went into this.
	Unlike most other point-and-clickers, there's not much plot or dialogue at all. Klaymen, our hero, is all alone for the most part. He never speaks, except for one sole part near the end. There are only a few other creatures in his world, quite a few of which want to hurt him, and he has to figure out what happened that made the Neverhood so barren. This is revealed to you through little disks left by Klaymen's cousin, Willie Trombone. When you collect all of them, you are presented with a nifty little animated sequence which explains what happened to The Neverhood and its king, the strange creature named Hoborg. It all involves an evil villain named Klogg who's naturally up to no good. It's not a terribly complex plot, but the execution is done very well, and the voice acting is superb.
	Aside from the language, there are a few notable differences between it and the original PC version. The resolution needed to be downgraded, but it still looks pretty good, and most of the animation is intact. It being on the Playstation, there are a LOT of loading times where there weren't any before, such as between screens, and even when Klaymen does his animations when he's holding still. This is annoying, but what makes it even more so is that the music starts over every time it happens. There is also a bit of a tutorial when you start the game. It mainly consists of little signs saying something like, "Push the circle button here!" so it's not all that special. The voices are also in Japanese, but sadly, they're very monotone and completely lack the soul that the American voices had. Probably the sole positive addition is the sound test in the options menu, which is really the only thing this version has going for it.
	There are also some omissions from the PC version. The ridiculous two-minute-long belch has been cut out, which is strange, considering that belching after a meal is a complimentary gesture in the East. Also omitted, thankfully, is the incredibly lengthy hallway in the house with the "H" on the door. The hall originally had a lot of stories about former kings of the Neverhood written on its walls, but it's highly unlikely many players actually took the time to read all of it, which is probably why it was taken out. It's just as well; the only real reason for traversing the hall is for the Klay disk at the end. The worst of the omissions is the lack of the "fast forward" code or the ability to skip the little walking sequences. In the PC version, if you typed "fastforward", the action would speed up, and you could also skip the walking segments by pressing the Space bar. These things made backtracking a lot less tedious, but as far as I can tell, neither feature is in the Japanese version.
	One of the most important new features of the Playstation version is the use of the analog controller and the support of the vibration function.

Rather than having the option of using either a melee weapon or a gun, each character is equipped with his or her own specific weapon.

An unblockable fireball attack has been added in this installment.
	The Quest Mode has undergone a significant expansion, including role-playing elements. In addition to the dungeons featured in the first game, the sequel adds an explorable town, where the main character can eat, rest, and buy supplies. An experience system has also been added. Consuming food and potions will have an effect on the character's attack and defense power. Individual attacks and body parts can be increased in strength as well.
	Also new in the Quest Mode is the ability to capture encountered monsters and then use them as playable characters in the Vs. mode. The amount of playable characters in this fighting game can be therefore as high as two hundred.
