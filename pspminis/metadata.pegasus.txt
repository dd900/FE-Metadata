	You could also make a case itâ€™s more than 5 games, because some of the one player vs two player variations could be enough to be considered a whole different game. Regardless of the name, itâ€™s an intriguing package.

	The game sees our titular hero blasting into outer space to defeat a race of psychopathic cephalopod invaders intent on wiping Earth from the face of the galaxy: if the galaxy even has a face that is... Ace must speed across the surface of the earth, before blasting into space, speeding through a deadly asteroid field, taking on a Scumbag Factory Ship and defeating them on their home planet before blasting into the mysterious Dimension X to put an end to the Scumbag menace once and for all!

description:
	Formerly known as Rocket Racing, Aero Racer is a single-player top-down arcade-like futuristic speed racer entailing a competition between colored neon rocket ships.
	.
	The defining challenge of the game lies in controlling the momentum of the racing craft by using rear jet-boosters to grind and thrust off track boundaries, resulting in increased acceleration. Unlike other contemporary racing games, there are no weapons or damage meters; players must maintain a single minded effort to beat opponents to the finishing line.
	.
	Players can enjoy the following four different game modes:
	.
	1. Campaign: success in races, challenges, and trials enables players to progress through increasingly difficult tiers.
	2. Grand Prix: a set of interconnected races.
	3. Quick Race: instant pick-up and play mode.
	4. Party Mode: players take turns to compete in single-player challenges.

Each level has a minimum number of balloons that must be popped before progressing to the next level.

	In addition to the standard balloons, various levels have special balloons, such as a balloon with extra darts, a tack-filled balloon which will pop all nearby balloons if it is burst, and balloons containing boomerangs (useful for tricky balloon-popping maneuvers). Different levels also have varying obstacles which must be overcome as part of the puzzle, such as blocks which might be destructible with a dart.

description:
	Coconut Dodge is an arcade game in which a player must dodge falling coconuts, weave through airborne mazes and play beach ball keepy-uppy to collect giant shiny treasures. The game starts quite easy and gradually ramps up to insane levels of coco-bullet action.
	.
	What makes the game addictive is the combination of the predictable mazes and the random coconuts and beach balls. It makes the experience similar to a racing game, where the first few attempts at a new track are difficult, but once you’ve learnt the track, you can hone your movements to perfection whilst confidently dealing with the other cars.
	.
	Coconut Dodge works in a similar way as you learn to memorise and master the mazes. Most of the mazes in the game have two different routes; one that is nice and easy, and one that is more difficult. The difficult route always has more valuable treasure in it. So, when you come across a maze you can get through it quite easily, which makes the game suitable for some quick casual play on the bus. However, to get the most treasure and a high score, you have to learn some pretty complex movements that require good rhythm and very high precision.

	In all modes your ships (one red, one blue) are tasked with destroying wave upon wave of red and blue enemies; the idea being to survive, waste the bad guys and attain the highest score possible. Some of your enemies will cause chain reactions or change other enemiesâ€™ colors, so picking out the best shots will really help you survive and rack up those high scores!

	Defend your territory in Fieldrunners, a strategy game in the vein of Desktop Tower Defense.  Enemies begin to cross a field, and your goal is to prevent them from reaching the other side.  To do this, you are given cash to spend placing turrets, flamethrowers, rocket launchers and other defensive equipment across the field.  As you progress, you earn more money, which can be used to replace or upgrade existing equipment, or build more of it to increase your defensive power.

	That was the state of affairs back in 1984, when it was first published as number 11 in the line of original Fighting Fantasy gamebooks; 27 years later, it makes its way to its first computerized adaptation as a PSN mini for PS3 and PSP. The gamebook's complete 400-section text has been retained with selectable hyperlinks (and lots of reading!), along with its original interior illustrations, but there is interesting new material as part of the presentation: character generation is enacted through (shades of Ultima) a tarot card reading of sorts; additionally, players can choose to resolve combat and test against their stats (the FF gold standard SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK) through the total randomness of simulated die-rolls or by participating in a more involved tile-matching memory minigame. Of course, inventory and stat adjustment are fully automated.

Gameplay is a very faithful adaptation of the gamebook's Choose-Your-Own-Adventure decision-making, souped up with some of Laughing Jackal's innovations (tarot-reading character generation, skill-testing minigames in place of randomized die-rolls) from their earlier adaptation of the gamebook Talisman of Death. Game text is presented as scrolling words on a page, complete with the book's original illustrations.

	Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is a Playstation Mini game for PSP and Vita.
	Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims is exactly that, a 2D shooter built around the eponymous deity (controlled by the player) and his quest to protect eight pilgrims in their journey across perilous territories.
	Your own shots just knock their hats off, but getting hit by anything else will kill a pilgrim and send their spirit floating off with a sad little wail. This is bad not only because the pilgrims are a de facto health bar (losing them all ends the game) but powering up Cloud God depends on harvesting their love - juicy little hearts that pop up whenever you kill an enemy and increase in size as you blast more.
	You must get all of the love (given form as hearts) that they release, which then makes you much more powerful than you already are. You increase in size, look more menacing, and your attacks are more powerful. The pilgrims get the most excited when they witness ambushing ghosts and ghouls get annihilated by you. When they are excited, they produce more love, meaning more power to you.
	However, you have to be very careful when shooting. You grow weaker with every shot, so try not to channel your inner war-freak and have a little restraint, for the good of both yourself and the pilgrims. You also lose some of your steam if you get hit by enemy forces. And sometimes, the situation calls to for you to sacrifice your mightiness and provide cover to the pilgrims from the enemy assault with your own self.
	There are two types of attack: the normal shot (by pressing X), and the bomb shot (by pressing Circle). The direction of the normal shot depends on what direction you are pressing, so there is some strategy to what part of the screen you should be shooting from. Being too far from your pilgrims is very dangerous but allows you to cover more ground, while launching a full frontal assault can protect your pilgrims by absorbing all the incoming fire. You have to think through, in real time, what tactics you would like to employ. You can always get in the middle, then rush forward, then get to a safe distance; mix and match, and you got yourself going.
	The bomb shot is used if you are above the enemy. But thatâ€™s not all, as some enemies canâ€™t be killed with the bomb shot, only with the normal shot, and vice versa. There are also enemies where you have to inflict bomb shot damage first before switching to the normal shot to take them out.
	Enemies are varied, and they look good, even if they are vile and evil. There are boss fights, too, to keep you on your toes.  The Cloud God's powers and the heart system mesh so well that any enemy can be destroyed in a blink - so they've got to be deceptive, sneaky, and sometimes numerous. Paper lanterns send out an arcing flame on death, red-eyed foxes hide in the scenery, imps swoop to carry off unlucky pilgrims and bobbing doll heads send out swarms of kisses. Hands start clawing up from the ground, crows dive-bomb your crew, and demons with phallic noses launch them as languorous, looping rockets. The cheeky oriental stylings are gorgeous, transforming symbols into everything from freaky momiji to dick-nosed devils.
	As this suggests, one of the reasons Floating Cloud God is such a pleasure to play is its visual inventiveness, which has room enough for everything from Wario tributes to what looks like a crying poo. This big lump of a thing, which is introduced in a level called The Saddest Enemy, explodes into gobbets of mini-poo that are very useful for building up a heart multiplier. Perhaps they're babies? That would explain the sadness.
	Floating Cloud God has bags more where that came from, and despite the Minis tag has plenty of room to breathe (there are seven worlds with 27 stages, including boss fights). And it keeps on surprising. The controls are simplicity itself: left stick to move, one button to shoot and one to bomb. But you soon realise the subtlety of how shooting affects movement and vice-versa, which fairly soon you're depending on against every enemy pattern. The pilgrims, too, are loosely tied to Cloud God during some sections, and learning how to manage their momentum is another little learning curve.
	The final touch is a minor detail that ties up everything. The pilgrims' hats can be improved. There's no in-game benefit to this, beyond looking much more awesome, and it's done by completing stages without losing a single pilgrim. Obviously, if you start this process on the first level and never lose a pilgrim, the hats just keep getting better.
	Seems like such a small thing, doesn't it? Soon nothing but a perfect run will do. The restart option is accessible, knowing, and tempting. Every time a pilgrim fell, it was too much to take - I didn't see their tiny spirit float off to heaven so much as all my future headwear ambitions. And to be fair, by that point I had four dudes with top hats, two with octopus heads and two with space hero helmets. You can't be replacing any of them with Norman and his brown cap just because some demon gets a lucky shot in.
	That's the best thing about Floating Cloud God Saves the Pilgrims. You do want to save them, and not just because they represent 'health'. The hats are a big part of it, but just as much is the sense of pride in being a badass god - harvesting power at the right moment to smash through oncoming waves, battling desperate rear-guard actions against hails of deadly kisses and throwing yourself in bodily as a last resort (which sometimes works!). The little yelp as a pilgrim goes down is a sharp reprimand, a blow to the daydreams of an all-conquering deity.

Just like in the original game the player controls a hurricane in an attempt to steer polluted clouds into cleansing factories, to create cleaner air and thwart global warming. Polluted clouds are sent out gradually and these are drawn towards the hurricane that can move about freely on the screen. By moving the hurricane and keeping track of all pollution, the clouds need to be steered into the factories. Borrowing from the mechanics of Tower Defense games, the pollution needs to be moved away from high pressure zones. These zones immediately absorb the pollution and disperse it, adding 10% to the global warming percentage. Similarly, having pollution touch the hurricane yields a 20% percentage. When 100% is reached, Earth is destroyed and the game is over.

	HISTORY Egypt Engineering Empire allows players to build their own empire from its foundations to the height of its power. Acting as the leader of a territory from the Egyptian Empire, players manage all aspects of its rise, from economic growth to political power, the development of armies, and expansion into other regions by war and diplomacy.
	Empires are controlled from three main views: the Campaign Map shows the entire game world, including mountains, forests, coastlines, oceans, rivers, cites, and armies. The City Map gives players an overview of the structure and role of a city within the empire, and provides a basis for economic decisions. The Battle Map is to be used when diplomacy has run its course or when a city is being attacked, resulting in turn-based combat.
	All nations, cities and armies were carefully researched to ensure historical accuracy. The game is accessible for new users, while offering deeper gameplay for expert players.

	The Impossible Game. With a title like that, you know it'll be a tough ride but The Impossible Game takes "difficulty" to a whole new level. It's fast-paced and brutal, but with near-instant respawning, the experience is as smooth as it is deadly.
	You play a humble orange square, racing against a serene blue background. The trick is that there are plenty of obstacles on this course: triangles are like deadly spikes, and squares can be jumped on top of but will kill you if you slam into them. Likewise, you can die if you fall through a hole in the floor. Your orange square will hurtle forward regardless of the danger, and your only control is simple tap to jump. Longer taps equal longer jumps, and you?ll need meticulous precision if you want to survive. The music syncs with your music, which is a very nifty effect that adds to the surreal quality of the whole thing.

	Lets face it... sometimes, videogames can be a bit weird. For example, who ever thought to mix colour matching with time trial style rally racing? And then to decide it should graphically look like something involing alien pond snakes and cellular life? Makes no sense, right? We at PomPom pride ourselves in making as little sense as possible. Hence our decision to do all the above. The result is JellyPops.
	It goes something like this: You control a strange snake creature, which resides in a strange pond in a strange world with some strange rules. The aim is to stay alive as long as possible. Staying alive drains your live force, so Snake needs to collect life force gems to keep it going. With time, life gems become more and more scarce, resulting in a desperate race to reach the next gem before its lights out.
	Between Snake and the life force gems are a myriad of other beasties that require special attention. Coloured Jellies which boost your gems value when collected as part of a combo. Teethy fish things that try to blast you with plasma. Spikey rocks and walls. Bouncing spherical cells that can be controlled and used as battering rams. Each level with its own unique mechanics to understand and master.
	Features :
	Available on PSP minis
	Endless survival gameplay
	8 ponds to traverse
	Fun, slippy slidey racing type gameplay
	Bonus Spirit and Boost unlockables
	Medals awarded for achievements
	Custom music which dynamically chages with gameplay
	Quick playtime. The perfect game for filling 5 minutes.

To make it harder for the players to meet that goal, the courses are littered with obstacles like hills and sand bunkers. In addition the wind decides too where the player's ball lands.
	As opposed to real life though, the player can influence the ball's flightpath during the flight by choosing in which direction it spins. This allows to compensate for wind and also for a bad angle at the strike. How hard the player hits the ball is decided by a gauge where the player needs to click at the right moment. The same goes for the angle. Although the game hands the player a club that it thinks fits the situation, he can also choose his own.

	Various remakes of Speedball 2 have been released. Speedball 2100, released only for the PlayStation, is a 3D version of Speedball 2 with more options such as choosing and renaming any team, instead of having to play with Brutal Deluxe. This version, released in September 2000, failed to win over gamers and press because it lacked the speed and gameplay of the originals.[citation needed]
	Empire Interactive released Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe onto Xbox Live Arcade on October 17, 2007.[14] The game features a 3D graphics mode in addition to the "classic" visuals, as well as additional teams and online play.[15] According to statements by the Bitmap Brothers, this version of the game takes place in the 24th century. It was eventually delisted from Xbox Live Arcade, but people who have already downloaded it are still able to play it.
	Frogster Interactive Pictures released a remake developed by Kylotonn, Speedball 2 Tournament onto Steam in November 2007.[16] In February 2011, Tower Studios released another updated version called Speedball 2: Evolution, developed by Vivid Games for iOS. The game features multiplayer support and achievements via Game Center.[17] It was also released for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3.
	A remake for the PC titled Speedball 2 HD was released December 5, 2013 on Steam. It's developed by Vivid Games and directed by Jon Hare.[18]

	Sister Angelika is not your average nun: she has purple hair, carries a large gun and a larger scythe, and spends her days fighting zombies. The town of Jalombe is under attack by such zombies, and she has been summoned to help exterminate them. Together with Father Richiardo at the monastery, she must find and destroy the source of the outbreak before Jalombe is destroyed.
	Twin Blades is a scrolling action game where the player must slaughter waves of zombies as they spring up from the ground, using both a variety of different guns and a very large scythe. Killing zombies nets the player zombie hearts, which can be exchanged at the monastery for weapon and power upgrades, including new guns, more health, and even new moves. There are several types of zombies, some of which are resistant to certain attacks, and every so often a much larger, more difficult boss creature will appear.
	The player can freely travel between open areas, and as stages are played, night will fall, which will cause zombie swarms on other stages to replenish and strengthen. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a survival mode where the player must survive 31 days against endless swarms of zombies.
